Code and data at https://github.com/micoverde/taac-llm-compression", "summary": "In \"Compress or Route?\" (Johnson, 2026), we found that code generation tolerates aggressive prompt compression (r >= 0.6) while chain-of-thought reasoning degrades gradually. That study was limited to HumanEval (164 problems), left the \"perplexity paradox\" mechanism unvalidated, and provided no adaptive algorithm. This paper addresses all three gaps. First, we validate across six code benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, HumanEval+, MultiPL-E) and four reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, ARC-Challenge, MMLU-STEM), confirming the compression threshold generalizes across languages and difficulties. Second, we conduct the first per-token perplexity analysis (n=723 tokens), revealing a \"perplexity paradox\": code syntax tokens are preserved (high perplexity) while numerical values in math problems are pruned despite being task-critical (low perplexity). Signature injection recovers +34 percentage points in pass rate (5.3% to 39.3%; Cohen's h=0.890). Third, we propose TAAC (Task-Aware Adaptive Compression), achieving 22% cost reduction with 96% quality preservation, outperforming fixed-ratio compression by 7%.

However, the heterogeneity of the structure and semantics of these tables makes it challenging to build a unified method that can effectively leverage the information they contain. Meanwhile, Large language models (LLMs) are becoming an increasingly integral component of web infrastructure for tasks like semantic search. This raises a crucial question: can we leverage these already-deployed LLMs to classify structured data in web-native tables (e.g., product catalogs, knowledge base exports, scientific data portals), avoiding the need for specialized models or extensive retraining? This work investigates a lightweight paradigm, $\\textbf{Ta}$ble $\\textbf{R}$epresentation with $\\textbf{L}$anguage Model~($\\textbf{TaRL}$), for few-shot tabular classification that directly utilizes semantic embeddings of individual table rows. We first show that naive application of these embeddings underperforms compared to specialized tabular models. We then demonstrate that their potentials can be unlocked with two key techniques: removing the common component from all embeddings and calibrating the softmax temperature. We show that a simple meta-learner, trained on handcrafted features, can learn to predict an appropriate temperature. This approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in low-data regimes ($k \\leq 32$) of semantically-rich tables. Our findings demonstrate the viability of reusing existing LLM infrastructure for efficient semantics-driven pathway to reuse existing LLM infrastructure for Web table understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTaRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u6837\u672cWeb\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u516c\u5171\u6210\u5206\u548c\u8f6f\u6e29\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "Web\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5f02\u6784\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLMs\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u5426\u76f4\u63a5\u590d\u7528\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTaRL\uff08Table Representation with Language Model\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6bcf\u884c\u63d0\u53d6LLM\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u6240\u6709\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6210\u5206\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684softmax\u6e29\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f18\u6e29\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728k\u226432\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684Web\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cTaRL\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u590d\u7528\u73b0\u6709LLM\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548Web\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u6e29\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u91ca\u653eLLM\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aWeb\u539f\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent AI progress now makes full automation feasible for various CAD tasks. However, progress is bottlenecked by data: public corpora mostly contain sketch-extrude sequences, lack complex operations, multi-operation composition and design intent, and thus hinder effective fine-tuning. Attempts to bypass this with frozen VLMs often yield simple or invalid programs due to limited 3D grounding in current foundation models. We present CADEvolve, an evolution-based pipeline and dataset that starts from simple primitives and, via VLM-guided edits and validations, incrementally grows CAD programs toward industrial-grade complexity.

Recently, large language model (LLM)-based recommendation models have demonstrated impressive performance by leveraging LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities and broad knowledge. However, adopting LLM-based recommendation models in Federated CDR scenarios introduces new challenges. First, there exists a risk of overfitting with domain-specific local adapters. The magnitudes of locally optimized parameter updates often vary across domains, causing biased aggregation and overfitting toward domain-specific distributions. Second, unlike traditional recommendation models (e.g., collaborative filtering, bipartite graph-based methods) that learn explicit and comparable user/item representations, LLMs encode knowledge implicitly through autoregressive text generation training. This poses additional challenges for effectively measuring the cross-domain similarities under heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based framework for federated cross-domain recommendation, FeDecider. Specifically, FeDecider tackles the challenge of scale-specific noise by disentangling each client's low-rank updates and sharing only their directional components. To handle the need for flexible and effective integration, each client further learns personalized weights that achieve the data-aware integration of updates from other domains. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed FeDecider.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFeDecider\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\uff08Federated CDR\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u672c\u5730\u9002\u914d\u5668\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u96be\u8861\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06LLM\u5f15\u5165\u8054\u90a6\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u672c\u5730\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5e45\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u805a\u5408\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u4e8c\u662fLLM\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u50cf\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u90a3\u6837\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u53ef\u6bd4\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237/\u7269\u54c1\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f02\u6784\u57df\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFeDecider\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u91cf\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\uff1b2\uff09\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u66f4\u65b0\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86FeDecider\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FeDecider\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u57df\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faConstruct-and-Refine (CaR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u795e\u7ecf\u8def\u7531\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u63a9\u7801\u6216\u9690\u5f0f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u6216\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConstruct-and-Refine (CaR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6784\u9020\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u9002\u914d\u8f7b\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\uff08\u5982\u4ec510\u6b65\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u91c7\u7528\u6784\u9020-\u6539\u8fdb\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u5f81\uff08\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5178\u578b\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cCaR\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecfSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CaR\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8def\u7531\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u5171\u4eab\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods.

We introduce FlipSet, a diagnostic benchmark for Level-2 visual perspective taking (L2 VPT) in vision-language models. The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint.

Geometric Limitations of Steering in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Personality steering in large language models (LLMs) commonly relies on injecting trait-specific steering vectors, implicitly assuming that personality traits can be controlled independently. In this work, we examine whether this assumption holds by analysing the geometric relationships between Big Five personality steering directions. We study steering vectors extracted from two model families (LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-8B) and apply a range of geometric conditioning schemes, from unconstrained directions to soft and hard orthonormalisation. Our results show that personality steering directions exhibit substantial geometric dependence: steering one trait consistently induces changes in others, even when linear overlap is explicitly removed. While hard orthonormalisation enforces geometric independence, it does not eliminate cross-trait behavioural effects and can reduce steering strength. These findings suggest that personality traits in LLMs occupy a slightly coupled subspace, limiting fully independent trait control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u53bb\u9664\u7ebf\u6027\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u8d28\u95f4\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5904\u4e8e\u8f7b\u5fae\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u53ef\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u68c0\u9a8c\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790LLaMA-3-8B\u548cMistral-8B\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u4e94\u5927\u6027\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u8f6f/\u786c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u5411\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51e0\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1b\u786c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u867d\u5f3a\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u8de8\u7279\u8d28\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u524a\u5f31\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4e2d\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u8d28\u5e76\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5904\u4e8e\u8f7b\u5fae\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7279\u8d28\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Among the factors that define material appearance, gloss, along with color, is widely regarded as one of the most important, and recent studies indicate that humans can perceive gloss independently of the artistic style used to depict an object. To investigate how gloss and artistic style are represented in learned models, we train an unsupervised generative model on a newly curated dataset of painterly objects designed to systematically vary such factors. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical latent space in which gloss is disentangled from other appearance factors, allowing for a detailed study of how gloss is represented and varies across artistic styles. Building on this representation, we introduce a lightweight adapter that connects our style- and gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of non-photorealistic images with fine-grained control of these factors. We compare our approach with previous models and observe improved disentanglement and controllability of the learned factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u5149\u6cfd\uff08gloss\uff09\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u5149\u6cfd\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u6f5c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5149\u6cfd\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u827a\u672f\u4f5c\u54c1\uff09\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u6750\u8d28\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5149\u6cfd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\uff1b\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5149\u6cfd\u4e0e\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u8054\u5408\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u5149\u6cfd\u4e0e\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u753b\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u6865\u63a5\u8be5\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u6f5c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5149\u6cfd\u53ef\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5916\u89c2\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5149\u6cfd\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5149\u6cfd\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5149\u6cfd\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u7ea7\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6750\u8d28\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Submitted to the 48th Rocky Mountain American Astronautical Society's Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference", "summary": "In order for close proximity satellites to safely perform their missions, the relative states of all satellites and pieces of debris must be well understood. This presents a problem for ground based tracking and orbit determination since it may not be practical to achieve the required accuracy. Using space-based sensors allows for more accurate relative state estimates, especially if multiple satellites are allowed to communicate. Of interest to this work is the case where several communicating satellites each need to maintain a local catalog of communicating and non-communicating objects using angles-only limited field of view (FOV) measurements.

Simulation-based scenario testing provides a safe and cost-effective alternative to extensive on-road trials, enabling efficient evaluation of ADS under diverse and high-risk conditions. However, existing approaches mainly evaluates the scenarios based on their proximity to collisions and focus on scenarios already close to collision, leaving many other hazardous situations unexplored. To bridge this, we introduce a collision-related concept of conflict as an intermediate search target and propose a two-stage scenario testing framework that first searches for conflicts and then mutates these conflict scenarios to induce actual collisions. Evaluated on Baidu Apollo, our approach reveals up to 12 distinct collision types in a single run, doubling the diversity discovered by state-of-the-art baselines while requiring fewer simulations thanks to conflict-targeted mutations. These results show that using conflicts as intermediate objectives broadens the search horizon and significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of ADS safety evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u2018\u51b2\u7a81\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADS\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1a\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u6f5c\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u518d\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\u4ee5\u8bf1\u53d1\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u78b0\u649e\u7c7b\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5df2\u63a5\u8fd1\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u9669\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u2018\u51b2\u7a81\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u641c\u7d22\u51b2\u7a81\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u51b2\u7a81\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5411\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9645\u78b0\u649e\uff1b\u5728Baidu Apollo\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u591a12\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u78b0\u649e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u7c7b\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u4eff\u771f\u6b21\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u2018\u51b2\u7a81\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62d3\u5c55\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347ADS\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

In this stage, candidate items are indexed using their learned embedding vectors, and ANN search is executed for each user (or item) query to retrieve a set of relevant items. However, ANN-based retrieval has two key limitations. First, item embeddings and their indices are typically learned in separate stages: indexing is often performed offline after embeddings are trained, which can yield suboptimal retrieval quality-especially for newly created items. Second, although ANN offers sublinear query time, it must still be run for every request, incurring substantial computation cost at industry scale. In this paper, we propose MultiFaceted Learnable Index (MFLI), a scalable, real-time retrieval paradigm that learns multifaceted item embeddings and indices within a unified framework and eliminates ANN search at serving time. Specifically, we construct a multifaceted hierarchical codebook via residual quantization of item embeddings and co-train the codebook with the embeddings. We further introduce an efficient multifaceted indexing structure and mechanisms that support real-time updates. At serving time, the learned hierarchical indices are used directly to identify relevant items, avoiding ANN search altogether. Extensive experiments on real-world data with billions of users show that MFLI improves recall on engagement tasks by up to 11.8\\%, cold-content delivery by up to 57.29\\%, and semantic relevance by 13.5\\% compared with prior state-of-the-art methods.

Murphy", "Hossein Estiri"], "title": "Optimization Instability in Autonomous Agentic Workflows for Clinical Symptom Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Autonomous agentic workflows that iteratively refine their own behavior hold considerable promise, yet their failure modes remain poorly characterized. We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u4e3b\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u7406\uff08selector agent\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u540e\u6700\u4f18\u8fed\u4ee3\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c7\u72b6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8bcd\u5178\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u867d\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u610f\u5916\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u4e9f\u5f85\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6Pythia\u5f00\u5c55\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c7\u72b6\uff08\u547c\u5438\u6025\u4fc3\u3001\u80f8\u75db\u3001\u957f\u65b0\u51a0\u8111\u96fe\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f15\u5bfc\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\uff09\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u4e8b\u540e\u7b5b\u9009\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u57280.0\u20131.0\u95f4\u5267\u70c8\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u4e14\u632f\u8361\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7c7b\u522b\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff1b\u57283%\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0895%\uff09\u5374\u96f6\u68c0\u51fa\u9633\u6027\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9690\u853d\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u7406\u6210\u529f\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8111\u96fe\u548c\u80f8\u75db\u68c0\u6d4bF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bcd\u5178331%\u548c7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u662f\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u987e\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Meme Reply Selection\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86MaMe-Re\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u5883\u5e7d\u9ed8\u611f\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u5305\u56de\u590d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u90e8\u5206\u793e\u4f1a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u533a\u5206\u7ec6\u5fae\u5e7d\u9ed8\u5dee\u5f02\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u60c5\u5305\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u5730\u5236\u9020\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMeme Reply Selection\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b10\u4e07\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u517150\u4e07\u6761\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\u7684\u65e5\u8bed\u6f2b\u753b\u9762\u677f\u4e0e\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5e16\u5b50\u7684MaMe-Re\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09LLMs\u521d\u6b65\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7406\u89e3\u5938\u5f20\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u52a0\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u672a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8bed\u5883\u5e7d\u9ed8\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff1b\uff083\uff09LLMs\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u8fd1\u9009\u9879\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5e7d\u9ed8\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u5883\u5e7d\u9ed8\u56de\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u7528\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\\% and 4.02\\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components.

Using a within-subjects experiment (N=33), we compared Big Five personality scores derived from guided LLM conversations against the gold-standard IPIP-50 questionnaire, while also measuring user-perceived accuracy. Results indicate moderate convergent validity (r=0.38-0.58), with Conscientiousness, Openness, and Neuroticism scores statistically equivalent between methods.

This ecosystem is characterized by short-term, often one-off, transactions between parties that have no prior familiarity. To establish trust among users, platforms employ rating systems which allow users to report on the quality of their previous interactions. However, while arguably crucial for these platforms to function, rating systems can perpetuate negative biases against marginalised groups. This paper investigates how to design platforms around biased reputation systems, reducing discrimination while maintaining incentives for all service providers to offer high quality service for users. We introduce an evolutionary game theoretical model to study how digital platforms can perpetuate or counteract rating-based discrimination. We focus on the platforms' decisions to promote service providers who have high reputations or who belong to a specific protected group. Our results demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between user experience and fairness: promoting highly-rated providers benefits users, but lowers the demand for marginalised providers against which the ratings are biased. Our results also provide evidence that intervening by tuning the demographics of the search results is a highly effective way of reducing unfairness while minimally impacting users. Furthermore, we show that even when precise measurements on the level of rating bias affecting marginalised service providers is unavailable, there is still potential to improve upon a recommender system which ignores protected characteristics. Altogether, our model highlights the benefits of proactive anti-discrimination design in systems where ratings are used to promote cooperative behaviour.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u5b57\u670d\u52a1\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8fdb\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e73\u53f0\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u8350\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u6309\u58f0\u8a89\u6216\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u670d\u52a1\u5e73\u53f0\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u5206\u5efa\u7acb\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b67\u89c6\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6b67\u89c6\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8fdb\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u63a8\u5e7f\u9ad8\u58f0\u8a89\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u6210\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u8c03\u8282\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6784\u6210\uff09\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u4f18\u5148\u63a8\u5e7f\u9ad8\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u4f46\u52a0\u5267\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\uff1b\u800c\u8c03\u63a7\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u6784\u6210\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u51cf\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e5f\u4ecd\u53ef\u6539\u8fdb\u5ffd\u7565\u4fdd\u62a4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bc4\u5206\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u6b67\u89c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8c28\u614e\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7b56\u7565\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

We characterize this ecosystem-level failure mode as Retrieval Collapse, a two-stage process where (1) AI-generated content dominates search results, eroding source diversity, and (2) low-quality or adversarial content infiltrates the retrieval pipeline. We analyzed this dynamic through controlled experiments involving both high-quality SEO-style content and adversarially crafted content. In the SEO scenario, a 67\\% pool contamination led to over 80\\% exposure contamination, creating a homogenized yet deceptively healthy state where answer accuracy remains stable despite the reliance on synthetic sources. Conversely, under adversarial contamination, baselines like BM25 exposed $\\sim$19\\% of harmful content, whereas LLM-based rankers demonstrated stronger suppression capabilities.

A Benchmark of Uncertainty Metrics for LLM-Based Automatic Assessment", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u867d\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6559\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001LLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u523b\u753bLLM\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u5206\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5 grading \u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f02\u79fb\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u521b\u65b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u63d0\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6062\u590d\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6545\u969c\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53d7\u5185\u90e8\u521b\u65b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u968f\u673a\u63a8\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f02\u79fb\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u6709\u754c\u53d1\u6563\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u521b\u65b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u611f\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u65f6\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u91cd\u5efa\u6709\u754c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u5fc5\u9700\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics.

A key bottleneck is the need to collect many human demonstration trajectories when adapting driving policies to new cities that differ from those seen in training in terms of road geometry, traffic rules, and interaction patterns. In this paper, we show that self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning can adapt a driving policy to a substantially different target city using only the map and meta-information, without requiring any human demonstrations from that city. We introduce NO data Map-based self-play for Autonomous Driving (NOMAD), which enables policy adaptation in a simulator constructed based on the target-city map. Using a simple reward function, NOMAD substantially improves both task success rate and trajectory realism in target cities, demonstrating an effective and scalable alternative to data-intensive city-transfer methods.

Eimler"], "title": "A Decade of Human-Robot Interaction through Immersive Lenses: A Literature Review on Extended Reality as a Research Instrument in Social Robotics", "comment": "This is a pre-print", "summary": "Over the past decade, extended reality (XR), including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, gained attention as a research instrument in human-robot interaction studies, but remains underexplored in empirical investigations of social robotics. To map the field, we systematically reviewed empirical studies from 2015 to 2025. Of 6,527 peer-reviewed articles, only 33 met strict inclusion criteria. We examined (1) how XR and virtual social robots are used and in which contexts, (2) data collection and analysis methods, (3) demographics of the researchers and participants, and (4) the stated challenges and future agendas. Our findings show that social XR-HRI research is still dominated by laboratory simulations, while crucial specifications like used hardware, software, and robots are often not reported. Robots typically act as passive and less interactive visual stimuli, while the rich biosignal (e.g., eye-tracking) and logging functions of modern head-mounted displays remain largely untapped. The research teams and samples are predominantly tech-centric, Western, young, and male, with frequent gaps in demographic reporting. Key limitations include hardware delays, small homogeneous samples, and short, shallow study cycles. We propose a five-phase roadmap to establish social XR-HRI as a reliable research medium, which includes fostering methodological innovation, a reinforced ecological validity by, e.g., using application contexts, the improvement of the robot's interaction quality, promoting diversity in the sample and the development of a social XR-HRI taxonomy. Advancing in these directions is essential for XR to mature from a lab prototype into an ecologically valid research instrument for social robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e862015\u20132025\u5e74\u95f4\u793e\u4f1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08XR\uff09\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6/\u8f6f\u4ef6/\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ec6\u8282\u5e38\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u5f31\uff0c\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b49XR\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e0e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u5e74\u8f7b\u3001\u7537\u6027\u3001\u897f\u65b9\u3001\u6280\u672f\u80cc\u666f\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6837\u672c\u5c0f\u4e14\u540c\u8d28\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5468\u671f\u77ed\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u9636\u6bb5\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3001\u751f\u6001\u6548\u5ea6\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ca\u6784\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08XR\uff09\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HRI\uff09\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u68b3\u7406\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5398\u6e05\u73b0\u72b6\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b5b\u90092015\u20132025\u5e74\u95f46527\u7bc7\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u8bae\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7eb3\u516533\u9879\u4e25\u683c\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u4eceXR\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u60c5\u5883\u3001\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e0e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u8bae\u7a0b\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u793e\u4f1aXR-HRI\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6a21\u62df\uff1b\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u5982\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u578b\u53f7\uff09\u62a5\u544a\u4e0d\u5168\uff1b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u591a\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\uff1bXR\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u773c\u52a8\uff09\u4e0e\u65e5\u5fd7\u529f\u80fd\u672a\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u4e0e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4ee5\u897f\u65b9\u3001\u5e74\u8f7b\u3001\u7537\u6027\u3001\u6280\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u5e38\u7f3a\u5931\uff1b\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u5305\u62ec\u786c\u4ef6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u540c\u8d28\u6837\u672c\u3001\u77ed\u6682\u6d45\u5c42\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5468\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u793e\u4f1aXR-HRI\u5c1a\u5904\u840c\u82bd\u671f\uff0c\u8981\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u6548\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u63a8\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u521b\u65b0\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6269\u5927\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002"}}

This prevents them from being used as first-stage rankers, but also incurs a cost when re-ranking documents. Prior work has addressed this bottleneck from two largely separate directions: accelerating cross-encoder inference by sparsifying the attention process or improving first-stage retrieval effectiveness using more complex models, e.g. late-interaction ones. In this work, we propose to bridge these two approaches, based on an in-depth understanding of the internal mechanisms of cross-encoders. Starting from cross-encoders, we show that it is possible to derive a new late-interaction-like architecture by carefully removing detrimental or unnecessary interactions. We name this architecture MICE (Minimal Interaction Cross-Encoders). We extensively evaluate MICE across both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. MICE decreases fourfold the inference latency compared to standard cross-encoders, matching late-interaction models like ColBERT while retaining most of cross-encoder ID effectiveness and demonstrating superior generalization abilities in OOD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMICE\uff08Minimal Interaction Cross-Encoders\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7b80\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7late-interaction\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff084\u500d\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u57df\u5185\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u867d\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u9996\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u9996\u9636\u6bb5\u6548\u679c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982late-interaction\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5f7c\u6b64\u5272\u88c2\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u79fb\u9664\u5176\u4e2d detrimental \u6216 unnecessary \u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b late-interaction \u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u67b6\u6784 MICE\u3002", "result": "MICE \u5728 ID \u548c OOD \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e 4 \u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e ColBERT \u7b49 late-interaction \u6a21\u578b\uff0cID \u6548\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0cOOD \u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "MICE \u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e late-interaction \u6a21\u578b\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u6548\u679c\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Methods: We evaluated January Mirror, an evidence-grounded clinical reasoning system, against frontier LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Pro) on a 120-question endocrinology board-style examination. Mirror integrates a curated endocrinology and cardiometabolic evidence corpus with a structured reasoning architecture to generate evidence-linked outputs. Mirror operated under a closed-evidence constraint without external retrieval. Comparator LLMs had real-time web access to guidelines and primary literature. Results: Mirror achieved 87.5% accuracy (105/120; 95% CI: 80.4-92.3%), exceeding a human reference of 62.3% and frontier LLMs including GPT-5.2 (74.6%), GPT-5 (74.0%), and Gemini-3-Pro (69.8%). On the 30 most difficult questions (human accuracy less than 50%), Mirror achieved 76.7% accuracy. Top-2 accuracy was 92.5% for Mirror versus 85.25% for GPT-5.2.

We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity.

However, retrieved knowledge is often noisy, partially irrelevant, or misaligned with the visual content, while internal model knowledge is difficult to control and interpret. Naive aggregation of these sources limits reasoning effectiveness and reduces answer accuracy. To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMaS-VQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Mask-and-Select\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u8fc7\u6ee4\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347KB-VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KB-VQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ca\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b80\u5355\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMaS-VQA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u68c0\u7d22\u5019\u9009\u6bb5\u843d\uff0c\u518d\u7528Mask-and-Select\u673a\u5236\u540c\u6b65\u526a\u679d\u65e0\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u8be5\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ea6\u675f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u9690\u77e5\u8bc6\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728Encyclopedic-VQA\u548cInfoSeek\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMaS-VQA\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u566a\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3aKB-VQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0cMask-and-Select\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

In contrast, humans plan using maps: we reason globally first, then act locally. We introduce ReasonNavi, a human-inspired framework that operationalizes this reason-then-act paradigm by coupling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with deterministic planners. ReasonNavi converts a top-down map into a discrete reasoning space by room segmentation and candidate target nodes sampling. An MLLM is then queried in a multi-stage process to identify the candidate most consistent with the instruction (object, image, or text goal), effectively leveraging the model's semantic reasoning ability while sidestepping its weakness in continuous coordinate prediction. The selected waypoint is grounded into executable trajectories using a deterministic action planner over an online-built occupancy map, while pretrained object detectors and segmenters ensure robust recognition at the goal. This yields a unified zero-shot navigation framework that requires no MLLM fine-tuning, circumvents the brittleness of RL-based policies and scales naturally with foundation model improvements. Across three navigation tasks, ReasonNavi consistently outperforms prior methods that demand extensive training or heavy scene modeling, offering a scalable, interpretable, and globally grounded solution to embodied navigation.

The systemic effects of these loops remain poorly understood, in part due to unrealistic assumptions in existing simulation studies. We propose a feedback-loop model that captures implicit feedback, periodic retraining, probabilistic adoption of recommendations, and heterogeneous recommender systems. We apply the framework on online retail and music streaming data and analyze systemic effects of the feedback loop. We find that increasing recommender adoption may lead to a progressive diversification of individual consumption, while collective demand is redistributed in model- and domain-dependent ways, often amplifying popularity concentration. Temporal analyses further reveal that apparent increases in individual diversity observed in static evaluations are illusory: when adoption is fixed and time unfolds, individual diversity consistently decreases across all models. Our results highlight the need to move beyond static evaluations and explicitly account for feedback-loop dynamics when designing recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u63a8\u8350\u91c7\u7eb3\u6982\u7387\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2a\u4f53\u6d88\u8d39\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u63a8\u8350\u91c7\u7eb3\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u7fa4\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\u5f80\u5f80\u52a0\u5267\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\uff1b\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u662f\u865a\u5047\u7684\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u6765\u770b\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6982\u7387\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u91c7\u7eb3\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u96f6\u552e\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u8350\u91c7\u7eb3\u7387\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2a\u4f53\u6d88\u8d39\u9010\u6b65\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u7fa4\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u5e03\u5e38\u52a0\u5267\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\uff1b\u56fa\u5b9a\u91c7\u7eb3\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u4e2a\u4f53\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8d85\u8d8a\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u6559\u5b66\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u6599\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ea0\u9519\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\u4e9f\u9700\u88ab\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5355\u8f6e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7531\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u6559\u5b66\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6559\u5e08\u6279\u8bc4\uff08\u5373\u5efa\u6a21\u53cd\u9988\u73af\u5883\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5185\u5316\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982\u4ece\u6570\u5b66\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u7f16\u7a0b\u3001\u8c1c\u9898\u3001\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\uff1b\u5e76\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u88ab\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u9760\u89c4\u6a21\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u526f\u4ea7\u54c1\uff1b\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%.

However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons.

Our survey examines how natural language processing (NLP) research engages with fields of narrative studies, and proposes a taxonomy for ongoing efforts that reflect established distinctions in narratology. We discover patterns in the following: narrative datasets and tasks, narrative theories and NLP pipeline and methodological trends in prompting and fine-tuning. We highlight how LLMs enable easy connections of NLP pipelines with abstract narrative concepts and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. Challenges remain in attempts to work towards any unified definition or benchmark of narrative related tasks, making model comparison difficult. For future directions, instead of the pursuit of a single, generalised benchmark for 'narrative quality', we believe that progress benefits more from efforts that focus on the following: defining and improving theory-based metrics for individual narrative attributes to incrementally improve model performance; conducting large-scale, theory-driven literary/social/cultural analysis; and creating experiments where outputs can be used to validate or refine narrative theories.

A key challenge in this setting is the extremely large cardinality of item spaces, which makes training generative models difficult and introduces a vocabulary gap between natural language and item identifiers. Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem.\n  However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems.\n  In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation.

Despite that, LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored. We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage.

However, note-based models are particularly vulnerable to temporal and lexical leakage, where documentation artifacts encode future clinical decisions and inflate apparent predictive performance. Such behavior poses substantial risks for real-world deployment, where overconfident or temporally invalid predictions can disrupt clinical workflows and compromise patient safety. This study focuses on system-level design choices required to build safe and deployable clinical NLP under temporal leakage constraints. We present a lightweight auditing pipeline that integrates interpretability into the model development process to identify and suppress leakage-prone signals prior to final training. Using next-day discharge prediction after elective spine surgery as a case study, we evaluate how auditing affects predictive behavior, calibration, and safety-relevant trade-offs. Results show that audited models exhibit more conservative and better-calibrated probability estimates, with reduced reliance on discharge-related lexical cues. These findings emphasize that deployment-ready clinical NLP systems should prioritize temporal validity, calibration, and behavioral robustness over optimistic performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u865a\u9ad8\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u7ec8\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6291\u5236\u6cc4\u6f0f\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u4ee5\u62e9\u671f\u810a\u67f1\u624b\u672f\u540e\u6b21\u65e5\u51fa\u9662\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4fdd\u5b88\u3001\u66f4\u4f18\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u51fa\u9662\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684NLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u969c\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6982\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8ffd\u6c42\u4e50\u89c2\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

We study TTA for TVL models under such shifts and propose a reliability-aware framework that estimates per-modality reliability from prediction uncertainty and perturbation-based responses. This shared reliability signal is used to (i) filter unreliable test samples, (ii) adaptively fuse tactile, visual, and language features, and (iii) regularize test-time optimization with a reliability-guided objective.

In contrast, modern recommender platforms increasingly use complex interfaces such as carousels, which consist of multiple swipeable lists that enable complex user browsing behaviors.\n  In this paper, we study position-based click models in carousel interfaces and examine optimization methods, model structure, and alignment with user behavior. We propose three novel position-based models tailored to carousels, including the first position-based model without latent variables that incorporates observed examination signals derived from eye tracking data, called the Observed Examination Position-Based Model (OEPBM). We develop a general implementation of these carousel click models, supporting multiple optimization techniques and conduct experiments comparing gradient-based methods with classical approaches, namely expectation-maximization and maximum likelihood estimation.\n  Our results show that gradient-based optimization consistently achieve better click likelihoods. Among the evaluated models, the OEPBM achieves the strongest performance in click prediction and produces examination patterns that most closely align to user behavior. However, we also demonstrate that strong click fit does not imply realistic modeling of user examination and browsing patterns. This reveals a fundamental limitation of click-only models in complex interfaces and the need for incorporating additional behavioral signals when designing click models for carousel-based recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6e\u64ad\u754c\u9762\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u70b9\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u70b9\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u4e14\u7ed3\u5408\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08OEPBM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u9760\u70b9\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u70b9\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6392\u5e8f\u5217\u8868\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u91c7\u7528\u8f6e\u64ad\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9002\u914d\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8f6e\u64ad\u754c\u9762\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u70b9\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dOEPBM\u9996\u6b21\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u68c0\u67e5\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u4e0eEM\u3001MLE\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6301\u7eed\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u70b9\u51fb\u4f3c\u7136\uff1bOEPBM\u5728\u70b9\u51fb\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u68c0\u67e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u62df\u5408\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u4f46\u70b9\u51fb\u62df\u5408\u597d\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u68c0\u67e5/\u6d4f\u89c8\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7eaf\u70b9\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u754c\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7eaf\u70b9\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u8f6e\u64ad\u754c\u9762\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u68c0\u67e5\u4e0e\u6d4f\u89c8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u70b9\u51fb\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPAHF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9884\u52a8\u4f5c\u6f84\u6e05\u3001\u504f\u597d\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u540e\u52a8\u4f5c\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u65b0\u4e09\u6b65\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8d2d\u7269\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u504f\u597d\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u548c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAHF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u6b65\u5faa\u73af\uff1a\u9884\u52a8\u4f5c\u6f84\u6e05\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u6b67\u4e49\u3001\u4ece\u663e\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u504f\u597d\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u5229\u7528\u540e\u52a8\u4f5c\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u504f\u597d\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u9884\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u540e\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u5bf9\u6301\u7eed\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1bPAHF\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5feb\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5355\u901a\u9053\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u504f\u597d\u53d8\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PAHF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation.

However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCAFE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08AFE\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AFE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff1b\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "CAFE\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1aI\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u7684\u8f6f\u56e0\u679c\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5212\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u7c7b\u578b\uff1bII\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u7ec4\u7ea7\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u56e0\u679c\u7ec4\u548c\u53d8\u6362\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCAFE\u8f83\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53477%\uff08\u5206\u7c7bmacro-F1/\u56de\u5f52\u9006\u76f8\u5bf9\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u66f4\u5c11\uff1b\u5728\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea64\u500d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u5f52\u56e0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u800c\u975e\u521a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer superior reasoning, deploying them as low-level controllers leads to high latency, trajectory oscillations, and poor generalization due to weak geometric grounding. To address these limitations, we propose Fly0, a framework that decouples semantic reasoning from geometric planning. The proposed method operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) an MLLM-driven module for grounding natural language instructions into 2D pixel coordinates; (2) a geometric projection module that utilizes depth data to localize targets in 3D space; and (3) a geometric planner that generates collision-free trajectories. This mechanism enables robust navigation even when visual contact is lost. By eliminating the need for continuous inference, Fly0 reduces computational overhead and improves system stability. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that Fly0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving the Success Rate by over 20\\% and reducing Navigation Error (NE) by approximately 50\\% in unstructured environments.

Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark.

Text-Recognition Mediates Spatial Reasoning Across Three Model Families", "comment": "9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables. Workshop-length paper", "summary": "We present a simple experiment that exposes a fundamental limitation in vision-language models (VLMs): the inability to accurately localize filled cells in binary grids when those cells lack textual identity. We generate fifteen 15x15 grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells) and render each as two image types -- text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines -- then ask three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking) to transcribe them. In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway.

To address this, we propose Goal-Oriented Preference Optimization (GOPO), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that decouples strategy planning from response generation via an Expert Agent and a Customer Service Agent. The Expert Agent optimizes multi-turn goal preferences at the dialogue-trajectory level, while the Customer Service Agent generates responses strictly aligned with the selected strategy. We evaluate GOPO on public benchmarks and e-commerce customer service datasets, and introduce Task-focused Sequential Engagement (TSE), a sequence-level metric derived from real e-commerce interaction data. On the Mgshop dataset, GOPO improves TSE by 7.7% and 10.3% over PPO and Memento, with consistent gains in sequence-level reward and generation quality. Furthermore, a 14B model trained with GOPO achieves 2.7% and 1.5% higher TSE than Qwen-235B and GPT-5.2, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the Expert Agent's critical role in long-horizon optimization. GOPO demonstrates consistent improvements across other datasets as well.

To address this, we introduce Team-of-Thoughts, a novel MAS architecture that leverages the complementary capabilities of heterogeneous agents via an orchestrator-tool paradigm. Our framework introduces two key mechanisms to optimize performance: (1) an orchestrator calibration scheme that identifies models with superior coordination capabilities, and (2) a self-assessment protocol where tool agents profile their own domain expertise to account for variations in post-training skills. During inference, the orchestrator dynamically activates the most suitable tool agents based on these proficiency profiles. Experiments on five reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that Team-of-Thoughts delivers consistently superior task performance.

To bridge this gap, we present FUTURE-VLA, a unified architecture that reformulates long-horizon control and future forecasting as a monolithic sequence-generation task. Adopting a dual-sided efficiency paradigm, FUTURE-VLA leverages a temporally adaptive compression strategy to maximize spatiotemporal information density, enabling the ingestion of extensive multi-view histories while maintaining constant inference latency.

However, its scalability is hindered by excessive context length and redundant retrievals. Recent research on soft context compression aims to address this by encoding long documents into compact embeddings, yet they often underperform non-compressed RAG due to their reliance on auto-encoder-like full-compression that forces the encoder to compress all document information regardless of relevance to the input query.\n  In this work, we conduct an analysis on this paradigm and reveal two fundamental limitations: (I) Infeasibility, full-compression conflicts with the LLM's downstream generation behavior; and (II) Non-necessity: full-compression is unnecessary and dilutes task-relevant information density. Motivated by these insights, we introduce SeleCom, a selector-based soft compression framework for RAG that redefines the encoder's role as query-conditioned information selector. The selector is decoder-only and is trained with a massive, diverse and difficulty-graded synthetic QA dataset with curriculum learning.\n  Extensive experiments show that SeleCom significantly outperforms existing soft compression approaches and achieves competitive or superior performance to non-compression baselines, while reducing computation and latency by 33.8%~84.6%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSeleCom\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347RAG\u4e2d\u8f6f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u51b2\u7a81\u4e14\u7a00\u91ca\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeleCom\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u7684\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u89d2\u8272\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u7ea7\u7684\u5408\u6210QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7ed3\u5408\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "SeleCom\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u975e\u538b\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf33.8%~84.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u538b\u7f29\u5728RAG\u8f6f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u65e2\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\uff1b\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u66f4\u5951\u5408LLM\u751f\u6210\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences.

While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity.

Existing registration methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality, while recent generative approaches address domain shift through complex architectures that lack temporal awareness across frames. We propose GPEReg-Net, a scene-appearance disentanglement framework that separates domain-invariant scene features from domain-specific appearance codes via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), enabling direct image-to-image registration without explicit deformation field estimation. To exploit temporal structure in sequential acquisitions, we introduce a Global Position Encoding (GPE) module that combines learnable position embeddings with sinusoidal encoding and cross-frame attention, allowing the network to leverage context from neighboring frames for improved temporal coherence. On the OR-PAM-Reg-4K benchmark (432 test samples), GPEReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.953, SSIM of 0.932, and PSNR of 34.49dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.8% in SSIM and 1.99dB in PSNR while maintaining competitive NCC.

Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios.

However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faB-DENSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u652f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4e22\u5f03\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u6b65\u9aa4\u800c\u9020\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u663e\u8457\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faB-DENSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u5b66\u751f\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u8f93\u51faK\u500d\u6269\u5c55\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ec4\u901a\u9053\u5bf9\u5e94\u6559\u5e08\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u79bb\u6563\u4e2d\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u5404\u5206\u652f\u540c\u65f6\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u6559\u5e08\u6574\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u5373\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To boost both effectiveness and transferability in this setting, we propose a new detect-segment-identify pipeline that leverages the Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation and the Segment Anything models as pre-processing stages alongside Re-ID networks. To evaluate our approach, we publish a collection of nine days CCTV data filmed on a working dairy farm. Our methodology overcomes detection breakdown in dense animal groupings, resulting in a 98.93% accuracy. This significantly outperforms current oriented bounding box-driven, as well as SAM species detection baselines with accuracy improvements of 47.52% and 27.13%, respectively. We show that unsupervised contrastive learning can build on this to yield 94.82% Re-ID accuracy on our test data.

This paper introduces a novel Collaborative Reasoning and Adaptive Fusion (CRAF) framework that systematically integrates traditional feature-based methods with large language models (LLMs) through a structured multi-stage reasoning mechanism. Our approach features four key innovations: (1) a cross-platform collaborative attention module that aligns semantic representations while preserving source-specific characteristics, (2) a hierarchical adaptive fusion mechanism that dynamically weights features based on both data quality and task requirements, (3) a joint optimization strategy that simultaneously learns topic representations and sentiment distributions through shared latent spaces, and (4) a novel multimodal extraction capability that processes video content from platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou by integrating OCR, ASR, and visual sentiment analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRAF achieves a tighter generalization bound with a reduction of O(sqrt(d log K / m)) compared to independent source modeling, where d is feature dimensionality, K is the number of sources, and m is sample size. Comprehensive experiments on three multi-platform datasets (Weibo-12, CrossPlatform-15, NewsForum-8) show that CRAF achieves an average topic clustering ARI of 0.76 (4.1% improvement over best baseline) and sentiment analysis F1-score of 0.84 (3.8% improvement). The framework exhibits strong cross-platform adaptability, reducing the labeled data requirement for new platforms by 75%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCRAF\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8206\u60c5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u52a0\u6743\u3001\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u516c\u5171\u8206\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u504f\u5dee\u4e0a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u6e90\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCRAF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u534f\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u652f\u6301OCR/ASR/\u89c6\u89c9\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eCRAF\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u66f4\u7d27\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e3b\u9898\u805a\u7c7bARI\u8fbe0.76\uff08+4.1%\uff09\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790F1\u8fbe0.84\uff08+3.8%\uff09\uff0c\u65b0\u5e73\u53f0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u964d\u4f4e75%\u3002", "conclusion": "CRAF\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u8206\u60c5\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5e73\u53f0\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The device's kinematics, mechanical design, instrumentation, and prototypes are developed and presented to meet the specific requirements of laparoscopic training context, including movement around a fixed center of motion and seamless integration into standard box trainers. The system IMTD's tracking accuracy and reliability are compared to a motion capture system (MoCap), assessing its ability to capture both angular and translational motions of surgical instruments. The study then focuses on key performance parameters including precision, fluidity, speed, and overall motion efficiency. The results highlight the system's effectiveness in tracking surgical gestures, providing valuable insights into its potential as a tool for training and performance evaluation in minimally invasive surgery. Additionally, IMTD's low cost and integrated design allow for easy integration and implementation in training rooms, offering a practical and accessible solution for general use.

Despite its popularity, there are virtually no analytical tools to determine the suitability of clustering-based ANNS for a given dataset -- what we call \"searchability.\" To address that gap, we present two measures for flat clusterings of high-dimensional points in Euclidean space. First is Clustering-Neighborhood Stability Measure (clustering-NSM), an internal measure of clustering quality -- a function of a clustering of a dataset -- that we show to be predictive of ANNS accuracy. The second, Point-Neighborhood Stability Measure (point-NSM), is a measure of clusterability -- a function of the dataset itself -- that is predictive of clustering-NSM. The two together allow us to determine whether a dataset is searchable by clustering-based ANNS given only the data points.

Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between \"learning-aware\" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between \"naive learners\" updating on fast timescales and \"meta-learners\" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u4e25\u683c\u533a\u5206\u5feb\u6162\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u6297\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u52d2\u7d22\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u76f8\u4e92\u5851\u9020\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u51fa\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u4e60\u5f97\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, contact-based sensors such as pulse oximeters may cause skin irritation, increase infection risk, and lead to patient discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data.\n  We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.\n  To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients.\n  Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm. Without explicit region-of-interest extraction, the model consistently attends to pulse-rich areas and demonstrates robustness under clinical occlusions and noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u513f\u79d1\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u5ba4\uff08PICU\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763rPPG\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VisionMamba\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5e08\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u5fc3\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728PICU\u4e2d\u6613\u81f4\u76ae\u80a4\u523a\u6fc0\u3001\u611f\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4e0d\u9002\uff1brPPG\u867d\u4e3a\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eVisionMamba\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Mamba\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u516c\u5f00\u5e72\u51c0\u89c6\u9891\u2192\u5408\u6210\u906e\u6321\u2192500\u4f8b\u60a3\u513f\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u89c6\u9891\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668MAE\u964d\u4f4e42%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8ePhysFormer 31%\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8MAE\u8fbe3.2 bpm\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0fROI\u63d0\u53d6\u5373\u80fd\u805a\u7126\u8109\u640f\u4e30\u5bcc\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u906e\u6321\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86rPPG\u5728\u771f\u5b9ePICU\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Kononova"], "title": "State Design Matters: How Representations Shape Dynamic Reasoning in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) move from static reasoning tasks toward dynamic environments, their success depends on the ability to navigate and respond to an environment that changes as they interact at inference time. An underexplored factor in these settings is the representation of the state. Holding model parameters fixed, we systematically vary three key aspects: (1) state granularity (long form versus summary), (2) structure (natural language versus symbolic), and (3) spatial grounding (text-only versus images or textual map encodings) across sequential decision-making benchmarks. We find that trajectory summarisation improves performance by reducing noise and stabilising long-horizon reasoning. Second, natural language representations are the most robust across models, whereas structured encodings help mainly for models with strong code or structured output priors, such as JSON schemas. Third, while image-inputs show some benefit, text-based spatial encodings prove most effective. This advantage stems not from the spatial information itself, but from the act of construction, which compels the model to perform the spatial reasoning that static input does not elicit. Overall, we demonstrate that design choices for representing state are a decisive factor in performance, distinct from the availability of information itself.

As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions.

Despite the meteoric rise in the number of neuromorphic datasets published over the past ten years, the conclusion of a significant portion of neuromorphic research papers still states that there is a need for yet more data and even larger datasets. Whilst this need is driven in part by the sheer volume of data required by modern deep learning approaches, it is also fuelled by the current state of the available neuromorphic datasets and the difficulties in finding them, understanding their purpose, and determining the nature of their underlying task. This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data. This paper also highlights the growth in the size of individual datasets and the complexities involved in working with the data. However, a more important concern is the rise of synthetic datasets, created by either simulation or video-to-events methods. This review explores the benefits of simulated data for testing existing algorithms and applications, highlighting the potential pitfalls for exploring new applications of neuromorphic technologies.

This paper presents an end-to-end framework for constructing and evaluating a conversational AI assistant directly from historical call transcripts. Incoming transcripts are first graded using a simplified adaptation of the PIPA framework, focusing on observation alignment and appropriate response behavior, and are filtered to retain only high-quality interactions exhibiting coherent flow and effective human agent responses. Structured knowledge is then extracted from curated transcripts using large language models (LLMs) and deployed as the sole grounding source in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Assistant behavior is governed through systematic prompt tuning, progressing from monolithic prompts to lean, modular, and governed designs that ensure consistency, safety, and controllable execution. Evaluation is conducted using a transcript-grounded user simulator, enabling quantitative measurement of call coverage, factual accuracy, and human escalation behavior. Additional red teaming assesses robustness against prompt injection, out-of-scope, and out-of-context attacks. Experiments are conducted in the Real Estate and Specialist Recruitment domains, which are intentionally challenging and currently suboptimal for automation due to their reliance on real-time data. Despite these constraints, the assistant autonomously handles approximately 30 percents of calls, achieves near-perfect factual accuracy and rejection behavior, and demonstrates strong robustness under adversarial testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u901a\u8bdd\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9762\u5411\u5ba2\u6237\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PIPA\u98ce\u683c\u8bc4\u5206\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001LLM\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7528\u4e8eRAG\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u62db\u8058\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u7ea630%\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5904\u7406\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u5411\u5ba2\u6237\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u52a9\u624b\u9762\u4e34\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u9700\u7cbe\u51c6\u4eba\u5de5\u63a5\u7ba1\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9886\u57df\u66f4\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u901a\u8bdd\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5316PIPA\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff1b\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f5c\u4e3aRAG\u552f\u4e00\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5355\u4f53\u5230\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u7ba1\u63a7\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u52a9\u624b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u62db\u8058\u4e24\u4e2a\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a9\u624b\u53ef\u81ea\u4e3b\u5904\u7406\u7ea630%\u7684\u901a\u8bdd\uff0c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u62d2\u7b54\u884c\u4e3a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e1a\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5bf9\u8bddAI\u843d\u5730\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME ~ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide.

It is the first model to use a new parametric mesh representation, Momentum Human Rig (MHR), which decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. 3DB employs an encoder-decoder architecture and supports auxiliary prompts, including 2D keypoints and masks, enabling user-guided inference similar to the SAM family of models. We derive high-quality annotations from a multi-stage annotation pipeline that uses various combinations of manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection. Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions.

This approach combines global cosine similarity with local manifold geometry to capture semantic structure that flat Euclidean metrics miss. Evaluating on eight BEIR benchmark datasets (1,233 queries), Maniscope outperforms HNSW graph-based baseline on the three hardest datasets (NFCorpus: +7.0%, TREC-COVID: +1.6%, AorB: +2.8% NDCG@3) while being 3.2x faster (4.7 ms vs 14.8 ms average). Compared to cross-encoder rerankers, Maniscope achieves within 2% accuracy at 10-45x lower latency. On TREC-COVID, LLM-Reranker provides only +0.5% NDCG@3 improvement over Maniscope at 840x higher latency, positioning Maniscope as a practical alternative for real-time RAG deployment.

Unlike standard Gaussian noise, signal reflection from debris introduces strictly non-negative ranging biases. Existing robust estimators, typically designed with symmetric loss functions (e.g., Huber or Tukey), implicitly rely on the assumption of error symmetry. Consequently, they experience a theoretical mismatch in this regime, leading to a phenomenon we formally identify as Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD)-a state where the estimator stagnates due to the coupling of persistent asymmetric bias and limited observation geometry. While emerging data-driven approaches offer alternatives, they often struggle with the scarcity of training data and the sim-to-real gap inherent in unstructured disaster zones. In this work, we propose a physically-grounded solution, the AsymmetricHuberEKF, which explicitly incorporates the non-negative physical prior of NLOS biases via a derived asymmetric loss function. Theoretically, we show that standard symmetric filters correspond to a degenerate case of our framework where the physical constraint is relaxed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that resolving SGD requires not just a robust filter, but specific bilateral information, which we achieve through a co-designed active sensing strategy. Validated in a 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, our approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, offering a resilient building block for search operations where data is scarce and geometry is constrained.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAsymmetricHuberEKF\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u8d1fNLOS\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u540e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u56e0\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u4f20\u64ad\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1-\u51e0\u4f55\u9000\u5316\uff08SGD\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u707e\u540e\u5e9f\u589f\u4e2dNLOS\u4f20\u64ad\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u8ddd\u504f\u5dee\u4e25\u683c\u975e\u8d1f\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u79f0\u9c81\u68d2\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08\u5982Huber\u3001Tukey\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u7406\u8bba\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u7edf\u8ba1-\u51e0\u4f55\u9000\u5316\uff08SGD\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AsymmetricHuberEKF\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u53cd\u6620NLOS\u975e\u8d1f\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u662f\u5176\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u5f62\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u540c\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cc\u8fb9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3SGD\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u5782\u76f4\u4fef\u89c6\u626b\u63cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5bf9\u79f0\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "AsymmetricHuberEKF\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u707e\u540e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u5757\u3002"}}

Here, we introduce BTReport, an open-source framework for brain tumor RRG that constructs natural language radiology reports using deterministically extracted imaging features. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large general-purpose or fine-tuned vision-language models for both image interpretation and report composition, BTReport performs deterministic feature extraction for image analysis and uses large language models only for syntactic structuring and narrative formatting. By separating RRG into a deterministic feature extraction step and a report generation step, the generated reports are completely interpretable and less prone to hallucinations. We show that the features used for report generation are predictive of key clinical outcomes, including survival and IDH mutation status, and reports generated by BTReport are more closely aligned with reference clinical reports than existing baselines for RRG.

FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT.

While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions.

However, all of these approaches are limited by the image captured these conditions. An alternate approach is to utilize a programmable onboard light that adds to ambient illumination and improves captured images. However, it is not straightforward to predict its impact on image formation. Illumination interacts nonlinearly with depth, surface reflectance, and scene geometry. It can both reveal structure and induce failure modes such as specular highlights and saturation. We introduce Lightning, a closed-loop illumination-control framework for visual SLAM that combines relighting, offline optimization, and imitation learning. This is performed in three stages. First, we train a Co-Located Illumination Decomposition (CLID) relighting model that decomposes a robot observation into an ambient component and a light-contribution field. CLID enables physically consistent synthesis of the same scene under alternative light intensities and thereby creates dense multi-intensity training data without requiring us to repeatedly re-run trajectories. Second, using these synthesized candidates, we formulate an offline Optimal Intensity Schedule (OIS) problem that selects illumination levels over a sequence trading off SLAM-relevant image utility against power consumption and temporal smoothness. Third, we distill this ideal solution into a real-time controller through behavior cloning, producing an Illumination Control Policy (ILC) that generalizes beyond the initial training distribution and runs online on a mobile robot to command discrete light-intensity levels. Across our evaluation, Lightning substantially improves SLAM trajectory robustness while reducing unnecessary illumination power.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLightning\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u5149\u7167\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u5149\u548c\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u786c\u4ef6\u8d1f\u62c5\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u800c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5149\u7167\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u9ad8\u5149\u3001\u9971\u548c\u7b49\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "Lightning\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3Co-Located Illumination Decomposition\uff08CLID\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u73af\u5883\u5149\u4e0e\u5149\u6e90\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6c42\u89e3\u79bb\u7ebfOptimal Intensity Schedule\uff08OIS\uff09\uff0c\u6743\u8861SLAM\u56fe\u50cf\u6548\u7528\u3001\u529f\u8017\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u5c06OIS\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6Illumination Control Policy\uff08ILC\uff09\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cLightning\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SLAM\u8f68\u8ff9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7167\u660e\u529f\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "Lightning\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u95ed\u73af\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u5149\u7167\u63a7\u5236\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u5149/\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u4e0b\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%.

Existing benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on standard performance metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or mAP, while largely ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions. This single-objective evaluation paradigm is increasingly misaligned with the practical requirements of large-scale deployment, particularly in energy-constrained environments such as mobile devices, developing regions, and climate-aware enterprises. In this paper, we propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption, and carbon emissions of ML models. In addition, we introduce the carbon-performance tradeoff curve, an interpretable tool that visualizes the Pareto frontier between performance and carbon cost. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads, that carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are simultaneously accurate and environmentally responsible. Our proposal aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals.

Existing quantizers face a trade-off: vector-quantized tokenizers learn flexible geometries but often suffer from biased straight-through optimization, codebook under-utilization, and representation collapse at large vocabularies. Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.\n  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.\n  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization. At 16K codebook size, LGQ improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate, achieving comparable fidelity with substantially fewer active entries.

However, the underlying mechanism behind these gains remains unclear, making it hard to decide when and how to apply the technique effectively. In this work, we argue that the key benefit arises not from the generated examples themselves but from the act of creating them. To validate this, on reasoning-intensive tasks across diverse LLM architectures, we systematically evaluate three prompting strategies for in-context learning: (1) Zero-shot prompting; (2) Integrated prompting, where LLMs create and solve problems within a single, unified prompt; and (3) Decoupled prompting, where self-generated examples are reused as in-context examples, but the context of their creation itself is excluded. We conduct experiments across five widely used model architectures, demonstrating that Integrated prompting consistently outperforms both Zero-shot and Decoupled prompting. In contrast, Decoupled prompting offers only marginal gains over Zero-shot. Further, for a more in-depth analysis, we conduct an attention analysis and observe significant differences in attention patterns between Integrated and Decoupled prompting. These findings suggest that the advantage of self-generation prompting comes from the process of problem creation, not the examples themselves, providing valuable insights for designing more effective prompting strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u751f\u6210few-shot\u793a\u4f8b\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u201c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u201d\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u96c6\u6210\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\uff08Integrated prompting\uff09\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\uff08Decoupled prompting\uff09\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u751f\u6210few-shot\u6837\u4f8b\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u521b\u5efa\u5e76\u6c42\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3001\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u590d\u7528\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u6837\u4f8b\u4f46\u6392\u9664\u5176\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\uff1b\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u6210\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u5fae\u5f31\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e8c\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u4f8b\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4f18\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Autonomous sailboats are well suited for long-duration ocean observation due to their wind-driven endurance. However, their performance is highly anisotropic and strongly influenced by inhomogeneous and time-varying wind and current fields, limiting the effectiveness of existing coverage methods such as boustrophedon sweeping. Planning under these environmental and maneuvering constraints remains underexplored. This paper presents a spatiotemporal coverage path planning framework tailored to autonomous sailboats, combining (1) topology-based morphological constraints in the spatial domain to promote compact and continuous coverage, and (2) forecast-aware look-ahead planning in the temporal domain to anticipate environmental evolution and enable foresighted decision-making. Simulations conducted under stochastic inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments, including scenarios with partial directional accessibility, demonstrate that the proposed method generates efficient and feasible coverage paths where traditional strategies often fail. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first dedicated solution to the coverage path planning problem for autonomous sailboats operating in inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments, establishing a foundation for future cooperative multi-sailboat coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u5e06\u8239\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8986\u76d6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5f62\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u57df\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u611f\u77e5\u524d\u89c6\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u98ce\u573a\u548c\u6d41\u573a\u975e\u5747\u5300\u3001\u65f6\u53d8\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u5e06\u8239\u867d\u9002\u5408\u957f\u671f\u6d77\u6d0b\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4e14\u53d7\u65f6\u53d8\u975e\u5747\u5300\u98ce/\u6d41\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5f80\u590d\u5f0f\u626b\u63cf\uff09\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u8054\u5408\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u8986\u76d6\u7d27\u51d1\u8fde\u7eed\uff1b(2) \u65f6\u95f4\u57df\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u62a5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u524d\u89c6\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u9884\u5224\u73af\u5883\u6f14\u5316\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u968f\u673a\u975e\u5747\u5300\u3001\u65f6\u53d8\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\uff08\u542b\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fbe\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\u5e38\u5931\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u53ca\u65f6\u53d8\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5e06\u8239\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u8986\u76d6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u5e06\u8239\u534f\u540c\u8986\u76d6\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency.

Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead.

Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOmniCT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5207\u7247-\u4f53\u7d20\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u5668\u5b98\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21CT\u6570\u636e\u96c6MedEval-CT\uff0c\u5728CT\u5f71\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u517c\u987e\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728CT\u5f71\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u4e0e\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u5efa\u6a21\u5272\u88c2\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u5207\u7247\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7c97\u7cd9\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u5bb9\u5e38\u89c4\u5207\u7247\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniCT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff08SCE\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4f53\u7d20\u5207\u7247\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u4e09\u8f74\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528MoE\u6df7\u5408\u6295\u5f71\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5207\u7247-\u4f53\u7d20\u9002\u914d\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u5668\u5b98\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\uff08OSE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5272\u4e0eROI\u5b9a\u4f4d\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u6784\u5efaMedEval-CT\u2014\u2014\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5207\u7247-\u4f53\u7d20CT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "OmniCT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5fae\u89c2\u7ec6\u8282\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniCT\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86CT\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u4e0e\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We further found a (reduced by 2% - 9%) trade-off in model utility, MIA AUC (membership inference attacks) 0.81, AIA accuracy 0.75 (attribute inference attacks).

We introduce DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) built upon a pretrained video diffusion backbone. Unlike VLAs, WAMs learn physical dynamics by predicting future world states and actions, using video as a dense representation of how the world evolves. By jointly modeling video and action, DreamZero learns diverse skills effectively from heterogeneous robot data without relying on repetitive demonstrations. This results in over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks and environments compared to state-of-the-art VLAs in real robot experiments. Crucially, through model and system optimizations, we enable a 14B autoregressive video diffusion model to perform real-time closed-loop control at 7Hz. Finally, we demonstrate two forms of cross-embodiment transfer: video-only demonstrations from other robots or humans yield a relative improvement of over 42% on unseen task performance with just 10-20 minutes of data.

While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability.

Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates.

The game's dialogue-based structure provides a controlled environment for assessing how LLM-based chatbots interpret natural language descriptions and generate appropriate action sequences to succeed in the game. We test the performance of leading proprietary models - ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini - under both minimal and detailed instructions, measuring game progress through achieved scores as the primary metric. Our results reveal that all tested models achieve less than 10% completion on average, with even the best-performing model (Claude Opus 4.5) reaching only approximately 75 out of 350 possible points. Notably, providing detailed game instructions offers no improvement, nor does enabling ''extended thinking''. Qualitative analysis of the models' reasoning processes reveals fundamental limitations: repeated unsuccessful actions suggesting an inability to reflect on one's own thinking, inconsistent persistence of strategies, and failure to learn from previous attempts despite access to conversation history. These findings suggest substantial limitations in current LLMs' metacognitive abilities and problem-solving capabilities within the domain of text-based games, raising questions about the nature and extent of their reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u73a9\u7ecf\u5178\u6587\u5b57\u5192\u9669\u6e38\u620fZork\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff08ChatGPT\u3001Claude\u3001Gemini\uff09\u5e73\u5747\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db310%\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u6216\u201c\u5ef6\u5c55\u601d\u8003\u201d\u5747\u672a\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u53cd\u601d\u4e0e\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u4ee3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728Zork\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5ChatGPT\u3001Claude\u548cGemini\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0e\u8be6\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f97\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\u4f4e\u4e8e35\u5206\uff08\u6ee1\u5206350\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u4e3aClaude Opus 4.5\u7ea675\u5206\uff1b\u8be6\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u2018extended thinking\u2019\u65e0\u6539\u5584\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u91cd\u590d\u65e0\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6e38\u620f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u5176\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u8584\u5f31\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5176\u2018\u63a8\u7406\u2019\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u591a\u662f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u3002"}}

Copyright notice may change", "summary": "Reliable spacecraft attitude control depends on accurate prediction of attitude dynamics, particularly when model-based strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are employed, where performance is limited by the quality of the internal system model. For spacecraft with complex dynamics, obtaining accurate physics-based models can be difficult, time-consuming, or computationally heavy. Learning-based system identification presents a compelling alternative; however, models trained exclusively on data frequently exhibit fragile stability properties and limited extrapolation capability. This work explores Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling spacecraft attitude dynamics and contrasts it with a conventional data-driven approach. A comprehensive dataset is generated using high-fidelity numerical simulations, and two learning methodologies are investigated: a purely data-driven pipeline and a physics-regularized approach that incorporates prior knowledge into the optimization process. The results indicate that embedding physical constraints during training leads to substantial improvements in predictive reliability, achieving a 68.17% decrease in mean relative error relative. When deployed within an MPC architecture, the physics-informed models yield superior closed-loop tracking performance and improved robustness to uncertainty. Furthermore, a hybrid control formulation that merges the learned nonlinear dynamics with a nominal linear model enables consistent steady-state convergence and significantly faster response, reducing settling times by 61.52%-76.42% under measurement noise and reaction wheel friction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINNs\uff09\u7684\u822a\u5929\u5668\u59ff\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MPC\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u66f4\u5feb\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u521a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u7684PINN\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5e76\u5c06\u4e8c\u8005\u5206\u522b\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u73af\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027-\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "PINN\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e68.17%\uff1b\u5728MPC\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1161.52%\u201376.42%\uff08\u542b\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u98de\u8f6e\u6469\u64e6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5148\u9a8c\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u822a\u5929\u5668\u59ff\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0cPINNs\u662f\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7eaf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Accepted at InnovaRail 2026", "summary": "Railway crossings present complex safety challenges where driver behavior varies by location, time, and conditions. Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528TimeSformer\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u975e\u8d1f\u5bf9\u79f0CP\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u94c1\u8def\u9053\u53e3\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u8de8\u5730\u70b9\u3001\u8de8\u65f6\u6bb5\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5730\u70b9\u6bd4\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u80fd\u51b3\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u63a5\u8fd1\u9636\u6bb5\u6700\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u5206\u6790\u6bcf\u4e2a\u94c1\u8def\u9053\u53e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u5171\u6027\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6db5\u76d6Approach\u3001Waiting\u3001Clearance\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5f20\u91cf\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528TimeSformer\u63d0\u53d6\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u6784\u9020\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u8d1f\u5bf9\u79f0CP\u5206\u89e3\u6316\u6398\u6f5c\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u6210\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9053\u53e3\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6bd4\u4e00\u5929\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u80fd\u51b3\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1bApproach\u9636\u6bb5\u884c\u4e3a\u6700\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\uff1b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u6309\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u805a\u7c7b\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u9053\u53e3\u5f62\u6210\u72ec\u7acb\u884c\u4e3a\u7c07\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9053\u53e3\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6309\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9\u9053\u53e3\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b89\u5168\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

The model enables precise localisation of failure modes to specific pipeline stages, revealing, e.g., how tokenisation obscures character-level structure needed for counting tasks.

A taxonomy attempt and its applications to robotics", "comment": "Original version submitted to the International Journal of Social Robotics. Final version available on the SORO website", "summary": "Despite a surge in robotics research dedicated to inferring and understanding human intent, a universally accepted definition remains elusive since existing works often equate human intention with specific task-related goals. This article seeks to address this gap by examining the multifaceted nature of intention. Drawing on insights from psychology, it attempts to consolidate a definition of intention into a comprehensible framework for a broader audience. The article classifies different types of intention based on psychological and communication studies, offering guidance to researchers shifting from pure technical enhancements to a more human-centric perspective in robotics. It then demonstrates how various robotics studies can be aligned with these intention categories. Finally, through in-depth analyses of collaborative search and object transport use cases, the article underscores the significance of considering the diverse facets of human intention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u9762\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4ece\u7eaf\u6280\u672f\u589e\u5f3a\u5411\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u610f\u56fe\u591a\u9762\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e0e\u6c9f\u901a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u771f\u6b63\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Theoretical Guarantees under Contaminated Recursive Training", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u7528\u65e9\u671fAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u505a\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ecd\u80fd\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u6bcf\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5360\u6bd4\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff08\u5982\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5927\u91cf\u6df7\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u540e\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\uff1b\u5df2\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4ec5\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u7075\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f31\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4f5c\u79bb\u6563\u6216\u9ad8\u65af\u7b49\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u5668\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5b58\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff1b\u8f85\u4ee5\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u4e0b\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u7136\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u7b49\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u4e0e\u6bcf\u8f6e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u8f83\u5c0f\u503c\uff1b\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5173\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f97\u5230\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6bcf\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u5b9a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ecd\u53ef\u7a33\u5065\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Preprint", "summary": "Demographic bias in text-to-image (T2I) generation is well studied, yet demographic-conditioned failures in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing remain underexplored. We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

However, previous work has not examined their generalizability between formats, cultures, and genders. In this work, we systematically evaluate fine-tuned transformer models (BERT, ClinicalBERT, ModernBERT), small LLMs (Llama 1-8B, Qwen 1.5-7B), and large LLMs (Llama-70B, Qwen-72B) at de-identification. We show that smaller models achieve comparable performance while substantially reducing inference cost, making them more practical for deployment. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller models can be fine-tuned with limited data to outperform larger models in de-identifying identifiers drawn from Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, French, Bengali, and regional variations of English, in addition to gendered names. To improve robustness in multi-cultural contexts, we introduce and publicly release BERT-MultiCulture-DEID, a set of de-identification models based on BERT, ClinicalBERT, and ModernBERT, fine-tuned on MIMIC with identifiers from multiple language variants. Our findings provide the first comprehensive quantification of the efficiency-generalizability trade-off in de-identification and establish practical pathways for fair and efficient clinical de-identification.\n  Details on accessing the models are available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18342291", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u3001\u8de8\u6027\u522b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u591a\u6587\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u7684BERT-MultiCulture-DEID\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u5bdf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u3001\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08BERT\u7cfb\u5217\uff09\u3001\u5c0f\u578bLLM\uff08Llama 1-8B\u3001Qwen 1.5-7B\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578bLLM\uff08Llama-70B\u3001Qwen-72B\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u591a\u6027\u522b\u59d3\u540d\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90BERT-MultiCulture-DEID\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u5316\uff08\u4e2d\u6587\u3001\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u3001\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u8de8\u6027\u522b\u59d3\u540d\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff1bBERT-MultiCulture-DEID\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

ODYN combines all-shifted nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) functions with proximal method of multipliers to robustly address ill-conditioned and degenerate problems, without requiring linear independence of the constraints. It exhibits strong warm-start performance and is well suited to both general-purpose optimization, and robotics and AI applications, including model-based control, estimation, and kernel-based learning methods. We provide an open-source implementation and benchmark ODYN on the Maros-M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros test set, demonstrating state-of-the-art convergence performance in small-to-high-scale problems. The results highlight ODYN's superior warm-starting capabilities, which are critical in sequential and real-time settings common in robotics and AI. These advantages are further demonstrated by deploying ODYN as the backend of an SQP-based predictive control framework (OdynSQP), as the implicitly differentiable optimization layer for deep learning (ODYNLayer), and the optimizer of a contact-dynamics simulation (ODYNSim).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ODYN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5168\u79fb\u4f4d\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u975e\u5185\u70b9\u6cd5\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\uff08QP\uff09\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u7a00\u758fQP\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5168\u79fb\u4f4d\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e92\u8865\u95ee\u9898\uff08NCP\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u8fd1\u7aef\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ea6\u675f\u7ebf\u6027\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u7a33\u5065\u5e94\u5bf9\u75c5\u6001\u4e0e\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001AI\u7b49\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5217\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709QP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u75c5\u6001\u3001\u9000\u5316\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ebf\u6027\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548cAI\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u53ca\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u79fb\u4f4d\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5168\u79fb\u4f4dNCP\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u8fd1\u7aef\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5185\u70b9\u6cd5\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Maros-M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros\u57fa\u51c6\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u96c6\u6210\u81f3OdynSQP\uff08SQP\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u3001ODYNLayer\uff08\u9690\u5f0f\u53ef\u5fae\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\uff09\u548cODYNSim\uff08\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4eff\u771f\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21QP\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e1a\u754c\u9886\u5148\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5fae\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4eff\u771f\u4e09\u5927\u5178\u578b\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "ODYN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u4e14\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684QP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5185\u70b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548cAI\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

To convert planned embeddings back to text, we use a \\textbf{Vec2Text} renderer and introduce \\textbf{embedding perturbations} to robustify decoding under planner noise. Across nine benchmarks spanning general reasoning, math, and code, VDLM is competitive in pre-training and yields substantial post-training improvements on long-form generation tasks, outperforming other baselines.

In order to operate safely and reliably, AVs need to account for the inherent uncertainty associated with perceiving the world through sensor data and incorporate that into their decision-making process. Uncertainty-aware planners have recently been developed to account for upstream perception and prediction uncertainty. However, such planners may be sensitive to prediction uncertainty miscalibration, the magnitude of which has not yet been characterized. Towards this end, we perform a detailed analysis on the impact that perceptual uncertainty propagation and calibration has on perception-based motion planning. We do so by comparing two novel prediction-planning pipelines with varying levels of uncertainty propagation on the recently-released nuPlan planning benchmark. We study the impact of upstream uncertainty calibration using closed-loop evaluation on the nuPlan challenge scenarios. We find that the method incorporating upstream uncertainty propagation demonstrates superior generalization to complex closed-loop scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u6e38\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95ed\u73af\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u9700\u8981\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728nuPlan\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b-\u89c4\u5212\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728nuPlan\u6311\u6218\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u6e38\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u95ed\u73af\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u6e38\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08AO-ARMs\uff09\u4e2d\u4e24\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u4e0a\u7684\u5185\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u5206\u79bb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51faDecoupled RoPE\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f50\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u6027-\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AO-ARMs\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e24\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u89e3\u8026\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027-\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDecoupled RoPE\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u66b4\u9732\u76ee\u6807token\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u4f4d\u7f6e-\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784-\u8bed\u4e49\u6743\u8861\u4e24\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "Decoupled RoPE\u5728\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff08\u6b64\u65f6\u7ed3\u6784\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u4e8c\u8005\u504f\u79bb\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u4e8e\u5e94\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784-\u8bed\u4e49\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f4d\u7f6e-\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u6d41\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u4efb\u610f\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u6027-\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u6743\u8861\u6bd4\u4f4d\u7f6e-\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u79bb\u66f4\u4e3a\u6839\u672c\u3002"}}

Recent investigations have documented the presence of AI-hallucinated citations even in papers accepted at premier machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS and ICLR, underscoring the urgency of automated verification mechanisms. This paper presents \"CheckIfExist\", an open-source web-based tool designed to provide immediate verification of bibliographic references through multi-source validation against CrossRef, Semantic Scholar, and OpenAlex scholarly databases. While existing reference management tools offer bibliographic organization capabilities, they do not provide real-time validation of citation authenticity. Commercial hallucination detection services, though increasingly available, often impose restrictive usage limits on free tiers or require substantial subscription fees. The proposed tool fills this gap by employing a cascading validation architecture with string similarity algorithms to compute multi-dimensional match confidence scores, delivering instant feedback on reference authenticity. The system supports both single-reference verification and batch processing of BibTeX entries through a unified interface, returning validated APA citations and exportable BibTeX records within seconds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCheckIfExist\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u7f51\u7edc\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7CrossRef\u3001Semantic Scholar\u548cOpenAlex\u7b49\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5b9e\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u5373\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5f15\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5df2\u51fa\u73b0\u5728NeurIPS\u548cICLR\u7b49\u9876\u7ea7\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aCheckIfExist\u7684\u5f00\u6e90Web\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u9a8c\u8bc1\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728CrossRef\u3001Semantic Scholar\u548cOpenAlex\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b66\u672f\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6e90\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u7ef4\u5339\u914d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u5355\u6761\u53ca\u6279\u91cfBibTeX\u5f15\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6570\u79d2\u5185\u8fd4\u56de\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684APA\u683c\u5f0f\u5f15\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684BibTeX\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "conclusion": "CheckIfExist\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u53ca\u5546\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u670d\u52a1\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u514d\u8d39\u989d\u5ea6\u6216\u9ad8\u6602\u8d39\u7528\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u3001\u6613\u7528\u7684\u5f15\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Extended version of paper accepted to 2026 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2026). ScenicRules benchmark available at https://github.com/BerkeleyLearnVerify/ScenicRules", "summary": "Developing autonomous driving systems for complex traffic environments requires balancing multiple objectives, such as avoiding collisions, obeying traffic rules, and making efficient progress. In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner. We then construct a compact yet representative collection of scenarios spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations, formally modeled in the Scenic language. Experimental results show that our formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments and that our benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to the prioritized objectives.

Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u94c1\u8def\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VAE\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5149\u7ea4\u5149\u6805\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u6f14\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u94c1\u8def\u8f6e\u8f68\u754c\u9762\u6613\u78e8\u635f\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u6f14\u5316\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6613\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6807\u7b7e\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u8fd0\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u5bf9\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u5229\u7528AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5cf0\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ece\u6297\u7535\u78c1\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5149\u7ea4\u5e03\u62c9\u683c\u5149\u6805\uff08FBG\uff09\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8f74\u6570\u3001\u8f66\u8f6e\u7d22\u5f15\u3001\u5e94\u53d8\u53d8\u5f62\u7b49\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eVAE\u6f5c\u8868\u793a\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7531\u8e0f\u9762\u64e6\u4f24\u548c\u5e73\u9762\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5217\u8f66\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8f7d\u8377\u53ca\u8f68\u9053\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7b49\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e2a\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u548c\u5e94\u53d8\u7247\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5de5\u51b5\u6f14\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u94c1\u8def\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u8fd0\u7ef4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this constraint by retrieving external knowledge during inference, though it still depends heavily on knowledge base quality. To explore potential improvements, we evaluated three RAG variants-Standard RAG, DA-RAG, and our proposed Prompt-Enhanced Parametric RAG (P-RAG), a hybrid architecture that integrates parametric knowledge within the LLM and retrieved evidence, guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning-on both general and biomedical datasets. Using LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct fine-tuned via LoRA, we evaluate on PubMedQA and 2WikiMultihopQA. P-RAG outperforms Standard RAG on PubMedQA by 10.47 percentage points in F1 (93.33% vs. 82.86%; 12.64% relative). On 2WikiMultihopQA, P-RAG nearly doubles the overall score vs. Standard RAG (33.44% vs. 17.83%) and achieves 44.03% on the Compare subset (with 42.74% Bridge, 21.84% Inference, 8.60% Compose). CoT prompting substantially improves multi-hop reasoning but yields mixed results for simpler, single-hop queries.

A multimodal tactile stack combines piezoelectric (PzE) sensing for fast slip cues with piezoresistive (PzR) arrays for contact localization, enabling online construction of the grasp matrix. Upon slip, we update internal forces computed in the null space of the grasp via a quadratic program that preserves the object wrench while enforcing actuation limits. The pipeline yields a theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, with 5 ms for PzR-based contact and geometry updates and about 4 ms for the quadratic program solve. In controlled trials, slip onset is detected at 20ms. We demonstrate closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under external perturbations.

However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

In addition, we propose an image measurement method to easily acquire the calibration information between the camera coordinate system and the fork coordinate system necessary to apply the measurements in the camera coordinate system to the fork control. In the experiment space, a wide-angle camera was fixed at the backrest of a reach type forklift. The wide-angle images taken by placing a pallet in front of the camera were processed. As a result of evaluating the error by comparing the image measurement value with the hand measurement value when changing the pitch inclination angle of the pallet, the relative height of the pallet and the fork, and whether the pallet is loaded or not, it was confirmed that the error was within the allowable range for safely inserting the fork.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u89d2\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u53c9\u8f66\uff08AGF\uff09\u7cbe\u786e\u63d2\u5165\u6258\u76d8\u5b54\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u6258\u76d8\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u53ca\u76f8\u673a\u4e0e\u53c9\u5b50\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u95f4\u7684\u6807\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u53c9\u5b50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3001\u4f38\u7f29\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u503e\u89d2\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4f7f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5f15\u53c9\u8f66\uff08AGF\uff09\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u5c06\u53c9\u5b50\u63d2\u5165\u6258\u76d8\u5b54\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u53c9\u5b50\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3001\u4f38\u7f29\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u503e\u659c\u89d2\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u6258\u76d8\u5b54\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u671d\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u89d2\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u6258\u76d8\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u7b80\u4fbf\u83b7\u53d6\u76f8\u673a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0e\u53c9\u5b50\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6807\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53c9\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c06\u5e7f\u89d2\u76f8\u673a\u56fa\u5b9a\u5728\u4f38\u7f29\u5f0f\u53c9\u8f66\u80cc\u677f\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u96c6\u524d\u65b9\u6258\u76d8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56fe\u50cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6258\u76d8\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u3001\u6258\u76d8\u4e0e\u53c9\u5b50\u76f8\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u6258\u76d8\u662f\u5426\u88c5\u8f7d\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u63d2\u5165\u53c9\u5b50\u7684\u5141\u8bb8\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301AGF\u81ea\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u53c9\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6e90\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6311\u9009\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e22\u5f03\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6216\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u53ef\u80fd\u963b\u788d\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u2018\u597d\u2019\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u9002\u5408\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u2018\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u2019\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7b5b\u9009\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u4e00\u5927\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5b50\u96c6\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u88ab\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e90\u7b5b\u9009\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u878d\u5408\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u6e90\u66f4\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We introduce AFFMAE, a masking-friendly hierarchical pretraining framework built on adaptive, off-grid token merging. By discarding masked tokens and performing dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, AFFMAE removes dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. We developed numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels, and mitigate sparse-stage representation collapse via deep supervision. On high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, AFFMAE matches ViT-MAE performance at equal parameter count while reducing FLOPs by up to 7x, halving memory usage, and achieving faster training on a single RTX 5090.

However, the inherent discrete representation of text in existing frameworks often results in a loss of semantic integrity, leading to retrieval deviations. Inspired by the human episodic memory mechanism, we propose CogitoRAG, a RAG framework that simulates human cognitive memory processes. The core of this framework lies in the extraction and evolution of the Semantic Gist. During the offline indexing stage, CogitoRAG first deduces unstructured corpora into gist memory corpora, which are then transformed into a multi-dimensional knowledge graph integrating entities, relational facts, and memory nodes. In the online retrieval stage, the framework handles complex queries via Query Decomposition Module that breaks them into comprehensive sub-queries, mimicking the cognitive decomposition humans employ for complex information. Subsequently, Entity Diffusion Module performs associative retrieval across the graph, guided by structural relevance and an entity-frequency reward mechanism. Furthermore, we propose the CogniRank algorithm, which precisely reranks candidate passages by fusing diffusion-derived scores with semantic similarity. The final evidence is delivered to the generator in a passage-memory pairing format, providing high-density information support.

However, accurate readings can be challenging due to occlusions, limited viewpoints, or unexpected environmental conditions. We propose a hybrid framework that combines supervised failure classification with anomaly detection, enabling classification of inspection tasks as a success, known failure, or anomaly (i.e., out-of-distribution) case. Our approach uses a world model backbone with compressed video inputs. This policy-agnostic, distribution-free framework determines classifications based on two decision functions set by conformal prediction (CP) thresholds before a human observer does. We evaluate the framework on gauge inspection feeds collected from office and industrial sites and demonstrate real-time deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot. Experiments show over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between successes, failures, and OOD cases, with classifications occurring earlier than a human observer. These results highlight the potential for robust, anticipatory failure detection in autonomous inspection tasks or as a feedback signal for model training to assess and improve the quality of training data.

Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barab\u00e1si-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9GNN\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u4e0a\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff08\u5982Barab\u00e1si-Albert\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u4f53\u73b0\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5bf9GNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5931\u771f\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6309\u7279\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u6807\u5ea6\u6027\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u5f00\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u63d0\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e0aGNN\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u88ab\u907f\u514d\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u53d1\u6563\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "GNN\u5728\u5177\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

Traditional frame tracers rely on mechanical tools that need precise positioning and calibration, which are time-consuming and require additional equipment, creating an inefficient workflow for opticians. This work presents a novel approach based on artificial vision that utilizes multi-view information. The proposed algorithm operates on images captured from an InVision system. The full pipeline includes image acquisition, frame segmentation to isolate the eyeframe from background, depth estimation to obtain 3D spatial information, and multi-view processing that integrates segmented RGB images with depth data for precise frame contour measurement. To this end, different configurations and variants are proposed and analyzed on real data, providing competitive measurements from still color images with respect to other solutions, while eliminating the need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u5de5\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u773c\u955c\u6846\u8f6e\u5ed3\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528InVision\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u7528\u673a\u68b0\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u9a8c\u5149\u5e08\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u68b0\u5f0f\u773c\u955c\u6846\u8ffd\u8e2a\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9a8c\u5149\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4f4e\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eInVision\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u56fe\u50cf\u83b7\u53d6\u2192\u773c\u955c\u6846\u524d\u666f\u5206\u5272\u2192\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u2192RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u8f6e\u5ed3\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\uff0c\u5ab2\u7f8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u9759\u6001\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u7528\u8ffd\u8e2a\u786c\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89c6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u68b0\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bbe\u5907\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u914d\u955c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Most existing works are designed for a transductive setting, which learns dataset-specific embeddings and struggles to generalize to new KGs. Recent knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) improve cross-KG transfer, but they mainly exploit structural patterns and ignore rich multi-modal signals. We address these gaps by proposing a token-based foundation model (TOFU) for MMKGR, which exhibits strong generalization across different MMKGs. TOFU discretizes structural, visual, and textual information into modality-specific tokens. TOFU then employs a hierarchical fusion architecture with mixture-of-message mechanisms, aiming to process these tokens and obtain transferable features for MMKGR. Experimental results on 17 transductive, inductive, and fully-inductive MMKGs show that TOFU consistently outperforms strong KGFM and MMKGR baselines, delivering strong performance on unseen MMKGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bTOFU\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9atoken\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u6d88\u606f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MMKGR\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08KGFMs\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTOFU\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9atoken\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u6d88\u606f\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884ctoken\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u572817\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u8f6c\u5bfc\u5f0f\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u548c\u5168\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTOFU\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3aKGFM\u548cMMKGR\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1MMKG\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "TOFU\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u8de8MMKG\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

An adaptive penalty method is developed to ensure safety while balancing optimality. Trajectories from previous iterations are utilized to learn a value function using normalizing flows, which enables richer uncertainty modeling compared to Gaussian priors.

Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aImageNet\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u4e13\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8aImageNet\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u4e13\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff1b\u4e14\u80fd\u805a\u7126\u7269\u4f53\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing defenses mainly employ gradient perturbation techniques, e.g., noise injection or gradient pruning, to disrupt GIAs' direct mapping from gradient space to token space. However, these methods often fall short due to the retention of semantics similarity across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. In this work, we propose a novel defense mechanism named GHOST (gradient shield with obfuscated tokens), a token-level obfuscation mechanism that neutralizes GIAs by decoupling the inherent connections across gradient, embedding, and token spaces. GHOST is built upon an important insight: due to the large scale of the token space, there exist semantically distinct yet embedding-proximate tokens that can serve as the shadow substitutes of the original tokens, which enables a semantic disconnection in the token space while preserving the connection in the embedding and gradient spaces. GHOST comprises a searching step, which identifies semantically distinct candidate tokens using a multi-criteria searching process, and a selection step, which selects optimal shadow tokens to ensure minimal disruption to features critical for training by preserving alignment with the internal outputs produced by original tokens. Evaluation across diverse model architectures (from BERT to Llama) and datasets demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness of GHOST in protecting privacy (as low as 1% in recovery rate) and preserving utility (up to 0.92 in classification F1 and 5.45 in perplexity), in both classification and generation tasks against state-of-the-art GIAs and adaptive attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGHOST\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728token\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u5207\u65ad\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u548ctoken\u7a7a\u95f4\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u6f14\u653b\u51fb\uff08GIA\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u672a\u80fd\u5f7b\u5e95\u6253\u7834\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0etoken\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u800c\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u8026\u4e09\u8005\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGHOST\uff1a\u4e00\u79cdtoken\u7ea7\u6df7\u6dc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u6b65\u2014\u2014\u591a\u51c6\u5219\u641c\u7d22\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u5019\u9009token\uff0c\u518d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u2018\u5f71\u5b50token\u2019\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u539f\u59cbtoken\u5185\u90e8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728BERT\u81f3Llama\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cGHOST\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u7387\u964d\u81f31%\uff0c\u5206\u7c7bF1\u8fbe0.92\u3001\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e3a5.45\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "GHOST\u901a\u8fc7token\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u65ad\u8fde\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods struggle to capture these structural semantics accurately, resulting in suboptimal performance. Graph-based RAGs structure such information in graphs, but the resulting graphs are often noisy and computationally expensive. Moreover, most methods rely on single-step retrieval, neglecting the need for multi-hop reasoning processes. Recent training-based approaches attempt to incentivize the large language models (LLMs) for iterative reasoning and retrieval, but their training processes are prone to unstable convergence and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we devise an ontology-based cube structure with multiple and orthogonal dimensions to model structural subjects, attributes, and relations. Built on the cube structure, we propose MultiCube-RAG, a training-free method consisting of multiple cubes for multi-step reasoning and retrieval. Each cube specializes in modeling a class of subjects, so that MultiCube-RAG flexibly selects the most suitable cubes to acquire the relevant knowledge precisely.

Loop closure detection between perceptual inputs of different robotic agents is easily compromised in the context of perceptual aliasing, or when perspectives differ significantly. For this reason, direct mutual observation among robots is a powerful way to connect partial SLAM graphs, but often relies on the presence of calibrated arrays of fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTag arrays), which severely limits the range of observations and frequently fails under sharp lighting conditions, e.g., reflections or overexposure. In this work, we propose a novel solution to this problem leveraging recent advances in Deep-Learning-based 6D pose estimation.

Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.\n  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.\n  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\\% and +8.3\\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5730\u7406\u53c2\u8003\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9-\u60ef\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u81ea\u52a8\u6821\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D-3D\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u3001\u5916\u53c2\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u52a8\u4f5c\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u5e03\u8bbe\u7684\u5730\u9762\u63a7\u5236\u70b9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u91ce\u5916\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u6821\u51c6\u53c2\u6570\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u52a8\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u6b63\u5c04\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u62102D-3D\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u53c2\u8003\u5f71\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u53c2\u548c\u5916\u53c2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u5728\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u5e74\u95f4\u516d\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cSCAR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eKalibr\u3001COLMAP\u548cVINS-Mono\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SCAR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u6821\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

However, the quadratic attention cost of Transformers makes inference memory-intensive and slow. While context distillation (CD) can transfer information into model parameters, per-prompt distillation is impractical due to training costs and latency. To address these limitations, we propose Doc-to-LoRA (D2L), a lightweight hypernetwork that meta-learns to perform approximate CD within a single forward pass. Given an unseen prompt, D2L generates a LoRA adapter for a target LLM, enabling subsequent queries to be answered without re-consuming the original context, reducing latency and KV-cache memory consumption during inference of the target LLM. On a long-context needle-in-a-haystack task, D2L successfully learns to map contexts into adapters that store the needle information, achieving near-perfect zero-shot accuracy at sequence lengths exceeding the target LLM's native context window by more than 4x. On real-world QA datasets with limited compute, D2L outperforms standard CD while significantly reducing peak memory consumption and update latency. We envision that D2L can facilitate rapid adaptation of LLMs, opening up the possibility of frequent knowledge updates and personalized chat behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDoc-to-LoRA\uff08D2L\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u84b8\u998f\uff08CD\uff09\u867d\u53ef\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u9010\u63d0\u793a\u84b8\u998f\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u9ad8\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDoc-to-LoRA\uff08D2L\uff09\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63a5\u6536\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\u540e\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u9002\u914d\u76ee\u6807LLM\u7684LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u540e\u7eed\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u590d\u8bfb\u53d6\u539f\u59cb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8282\u7701KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728'\u9488\u5728 haystack'\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cD2L\u5728\u8d85\u51faLLM\u539f\u751f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e34\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u65f6\u4ecd\u8fbe\u8fd1\u4f3c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9eQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cD2L\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6CD\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "D2L\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u9891\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

To address these issues, this study investigates the application of supervised learning, a form of machine learning, to model and predict the behavior of biohybrid machines (BHMs), focusing on a muscle ring anchored on flexible polymer pillars. First, static prediction models (i.e., random forest and neural network regressors) are trained to estimate the maximum exerted force achieved from input variables such as muscle sample, electrical stimulation parameters, and baseline exerted force. Second, a dynamic modeling framework, based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, is developed to serve as a digital twin, replicating the time series of exerted forces observed in response to electrical stimulation. Both modeling approaches demonstrate high predictive accuracy. The best performance of the static models is characterized by R2 of 0.9425, whereas the dynamic model achieves R2 of 0.9956.

Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u5668SpecMuon\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Muon\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u6807\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\uff08RSAV\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5e38\u56e0\u68af\u5ea6\u75c5\u6001\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9891\u8c31\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u521a\u6027\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u96be\uff1bMuon\u867d\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5355\u4f4d\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b65\u957f\u8fc7\u5927\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpecMuon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff1a\u5c06\u77e9\u9635\u68af\u5ea6\u6309\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8c31\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u522b\u5e94\u7528RSAV\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301Muon\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u5f8b\u7b49\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u5728Burgers\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u5206\u6570\u9636\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cSpecMuon\u5728PINN\u3001DeepONet\u53ca\u5206\u6570\u9636PINN-DeepONet\u4e2d\u76f8\u8f83Adam\u3001AdamW\u548c\u539f\u59cbMuon\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SpecMuon\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u7387\u3001\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u6709\u754c\u6027\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u521a\u6027\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\uff08AMAA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee3D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\uff08SSC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u95e8\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728NYUv2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cJetson\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e73\u53f0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76eeSSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f53\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u53ca\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u6295\u5f71\u6269\u6563\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea0\u7f20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u89c6\u969c\u7528\u6237\u5ba4\u5185\u8f85\u52a9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5728MonoScene\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efaAMAA\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u9053-\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u5408\u4ee5\u8054\u5408\u6821\u51c6\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u95e8\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8c03\u63a7\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728NYUv2\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSSC mIoU\u8fbe27.25%\uff08+0.31\uff09\uff0cSC IoU\u8fbe43.10%\uff08+0.59\uff09\uff1b\u5b8c\u6574\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5728NVIDIA Jetson\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e73\u53f0\u7a33\u5b9a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "AMAA\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u76eeSSC\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u89c6\u969c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u8f85\u52a9\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While ensuring safe and high-performance inter-robot collaboration is critical for effective task execution, it is difficult to pursue in narrow environments where the feasible region is extremely limited. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for dual-quadruped collaborative transportation via safe reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we model the task as a fully cooperative constrained Markov game, where collision avoidance is formulated as constraints. We introduce a cost-advantage decomposition method that enforces the sum of team constraints to remain below an upper bound, thereby guaranteeing task safety within an RL framework. Furthermore, we propose a constraint allocation method that assigns shared constraints to individual robots to maximize the overall task reward, encouraging autonomous task-assignment among robots, thereby improving collaborative task performance. Simulation and real-time experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance and a higher success rate in dual-quadruped collaborative transportation compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53cc\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u540c\u8fd0\u8f93\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6210\u672c-\u4f18\u52bf\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u540c\u8fd0\u8f93\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u884c\u533a\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u907f\u78b0\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5168\u534f\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6210\u672c-\u4f18\u52bf\u5206\u89e3\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u56e2\u961f\u7ea6\u675f\u603b\u548c\u4e0d\u8d85\u9650\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cc\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u540c\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u72ed\u7a84\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u540c\u8fd0\u8f93\u3002"}}

In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length.

However, robots operating in real-world environments face a critical limitation: they cannot anticipate how objects move. Long-horizon mobile manipulation requires closing the gap between semantics, geometry, and kinematics. In this work, we present MoMa-SG, a novel framework for building semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs of articulated scenes containing a myriad of interactable objects. Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms.

Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u7535\u80fd\u76d7\u7a83\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MLP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u805a\u5408\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e25\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fd0\u884c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u8868\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08IID\u4e0e\u975eIID\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cAUC\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Alternatively, we explore fine-tuning an existing OCR model, despite not being trained for the target languages. Through extensive evaluation on multilingual Indic OCR benchmarks and deployment-oriented metrics, we find that the second strategy consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs. Chitrapathak-2 achieves 3-6x speedup over its predecessor with being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in Telugu (6.69 char ANLS) and second best in the rest. In addition, we present Parichay, an independent OCR model series designed specifically for 9 Indian government documents to extract structured key fields, achieving 89.8% Exact Match score with a faster inference.

Recent token-ranking heuristics accelerate inference by selectively processing a subset of semantically relevant tokens. However, existing methods suffer from unstable token importance estimation, often varying between layers. Evaluating token-ranking quality independently from heuristic-specific architectures is challenging. To address this, we introduce an Answer-Informed Oracle, which defines ground-truth token importance by measuring attention from generated answers back to the prompt. This oracle reveals that existing heuristics exhibit high variance across layers: rankings can degrade sharply at specific layers, a failure mode invisible to end-to-end benchmarks. The diagnosis suggests a simple fix: aggregate scores across layers rather than relying on any single one.

Simulation studies on representative robotic systems, together with hardware experiments on a Unitree B1 equipped with a Z1 arm, demonstrate faster convergence, lower inertial and friction estimation errors, and improved contact consistency compared to forward-dynamics and decoupled identification baselines. When deployed within model predictive control frameworks, the resulting models yield measurable improvements in tracking performance during locomotion over challenging environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u60ef\u6027\u3001\u6469\u64e6\uff09\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u7ea6\u675f\u53ca\u5b8c\u6574\u5173\u8282\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u80fd\u91cf\u57fa\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f/\u7b49\u5f0f\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u8026\u6469\u64e6\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675fRiccati\u9012\u63a8\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0eUnitree B1+Z1\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u524d\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u8fa8\u8bc6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u60ef\u6027\u4e0e\u6469\u64e6\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165MPC\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001-\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing.

In GCM, we first construct a dataset of contrasting inputs and responses. Then, we quantify how individual model components mediate the contrastive concept and select the strongest mediators for steering.

To overcome these limitations, monitoring systems must enable persistent and autonomous operations without the need for continuous surface support. Despite recent advances, resident underwater vehicles remain uncommon due to persistent challenges in autonomy, robotic resilience, and mechanical robustness, particularly under long-term deployment in harsh and remote environments. This work addresses these problems by presenting the development, deployment, and operation of a resident infrastructure using a docking station with a mini-class Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) at 90m depth. The ROVis equipped with enhanced onboard processing and perception, allowing it to autonomously navigate using USBL signals, dock via ArUco marker-based visual localisation fused through an Extended Kalman Filter, and carry out local inspection routines. The system demonstrated a 90% autonomous docking success rate and completed full inspection missions within four minutes, validating the integration of acoustic and visual navigation in real-world conditions. These results show that reliable, untethered operations at depth are feasible, highlighting the potential of resident ROV systems for scalable, cost-effective underwater monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c34\u4e0b\u5bf9\u63a5\u7ad9\u4e0e\u5fae\u578bROV\u7684\u5e38\u9a7b\u5f0f\u6c34\u4e0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u58f0\u5b66\uff08USBL\uff09\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\uff08ArUco+\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff09\u5bfc\u822a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bf9\u63a5\u4e0e\u5de1\u68c0\uff0c\u572890\u7c73\u6df1\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8690%\u5bf9\u63a5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c4\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u5de1\u68c0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u7f06\u3001\u957f\u671f\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u4e0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d77\u6d0b\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u4f4e\u9891\u6b21\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6301\u4e45\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6c34\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u652f\u6301\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5e38\u9a7b\u5f0f\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e0\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u96be\u9898\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u90e8\u7f72\u4e00\u5957\u5305\u542b\u6c34\u4e0b\u5bf9\u63a5\u7ad9\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5/\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5fae\u578bROV\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1bROV\u5229\u7528USBL\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ArUco\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bf9\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u672c\u5730\u5316\u5de1\u68c0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u572890\u7c73\u5b9e\u6d77\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b090%\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bf9\u63a5\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u5b8c\u6574\u5de1\u68c0\u4efb\u52a1\u8017\u65f6\u7ea64\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u58f0-\u89c6\u878d\u5408\u5bfc\u822a\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6c34\u4e0b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5e38\u9a7bROV\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u7f06\u3001\u957f\u671f\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u4e0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods typically train with fixed coordinate system inputs, where geometric misalignment with these structures induces gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture.

We also introduce MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the \"Visual Placebo Effect\", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench, MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.

Yet much published work on LMs relies on a relatively small sample of closed-source LMs, limiting our ability to rigorously test psychological theories and evaluate LM capacities. Here, we replicate and extend published work on the false belief task by assessing LM mental state reasoning behavior across 41 open-weight models (from distinct model families). We find sensitivity to implied knowledge states in 34% of the LMs tested; however, consistent with prior work, none fully ``explain away'' the effect in humans. Larger LMs show increased sensitivity and also exhibit higher psychometric predictive power. Finally, we use LM behavior to generate and test a novel hypothesis about human cognition: both humans and LMs show a bias towards attributing false beliefs when knowledge states are cued using a non-factive verb (``John thinks...'') than when cued indirectly (``John looks in the...''). Unlike the primary effect of knowledge states, where human sensitivity exceeds that of LMs, the magnitude of the human knowledge cue effect falls squarely within the distribution of LM effect sizes-suggesting that distributional statistics of language can in principle account for the latter but not the former in humans. These results demonstrate the value of using larger samples of open-weight LMs to test theories of human cognition and evaluate LM capacities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd541\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u5177\u6709\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u4e00\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u52a8\u8bcd\uff08\u5982\u2018\u8ba4\u4e3a\u2019\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\u5f52\u56e0\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5e45\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c11\u91cf\u95ed\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u68c0\u9a8c\u53ca\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u9700\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u8fdb\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u572841\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u590d\u73b0\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u52a8\u8bcd vs \u95f4\u63a5\u52a8\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u5173\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "34%\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u9690\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u529b\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5728\u2018John thinks...\u2019\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u6bd4\u2018John looks...\u2019\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u66f4\u6613\u5f52\u56e0\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u7ebf\u7d22\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e45\u5ea6\u843d\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u9a8c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u90e8\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u63a8\u7406\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ebf\u7d22\u6548\u5e94\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u5ff5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Vision-based approaches reduce hardware complexity but are often constrained by limited geometric observability and high computational overhead, restricting real-time closed-loop applicability. This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76\u00b0 across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41\u00b0, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u7acb\u4f536D\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4f3a\u670d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u67d4\u6027\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u524d\u9988\u6e32\u67d3\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u5757\u53ca\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u67d4\u6027\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7075\u5de7\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u8fdf\u6ede\u3001\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u548c\u8fdc\u7aef\u4f20\u611f\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5176\u7cbe\u786e\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u53cc\u76ee6D\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u4f3a\u670d\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4eff\u771f\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e26\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u76ee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u3001\u70ed\u56fe\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u524d\u9988\u5f0f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u4f4d\u59ff\u6b8b\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b4\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763sim-to-real\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u6d4b1000\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee0.83 mm\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee2.76\u00b0\uff1b\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u95ed\u73af\u89c6\u89c9\u4f3a\u670d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee2.07 mm\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee7.41\u00b0\uff0c\u8f83\u5f00\u73af\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e85%\u548c59%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u5b9a\u70b9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u65e0\u5d4c\u5165\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u4f3a\u670d\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff08\u5c24\u5176CNN\u5230ViT\uff09\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u4ee3\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u9ad8\u6270\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6700\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\u5b89\u5168\uff1b\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u9632\u5fa1\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u653b\u51fb\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u5411\u6570\u5b57\u3001\u975e\u8865\u4e01\u5f0f\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u89e3\u8026\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u611f\u77e5\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6270\u52a8\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u524d\u6cbf\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u73b0\u4ee3\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982ViT\uff09\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6270\u52a8\u653b\u51fb\u6837\u672c\u6784\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u63a8\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u63d0\u5347\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u9700\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u653b\u51fb\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Each leg is modeled as a deformable continuum using discrete Cosserat rod theory, enabling the capture of large bending deformations, distributed elasticity, tendon actuation, and ground contact interactions. A modular whole-body modeling framework is introduced, in which compliant leg dynamics are represented through physically consistent reaction forces applied to a rigid torso, providing a scalable interface between continuum soft limbs and rigid-body locomotion dynamics. This formulation allows efficient whole-body simulation and real-time control without sacrificing physical fidelity. The proposed model is embedded into a convex model predictive control framework that optimizes ground reaction forces over a 0.495 s prediction horizon and maps them to tendon actuation through a physics-informed force-angle relationship. The resulting controller achieves asymptotic stability under diverse perturbations. The framework is experimentally validated on a physical prototype during crawling and walking gaits, achieving high accuracy with less than 5 mm RMSE in center of mass trajectories.

However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DressWild \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u524d\u9988\u5f0f\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u91ce\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u76842D\u88c1\u526a\u7eb8\u6837\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e943D\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u59ff\u6001\u5e76\u63d0\u53d63D\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u878d\u5408\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u53ef\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u5206\u5c42\u8bd5\u7a7f\u7684\u7eb8\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u59ff\u6001\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u53ef\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u7eb8\u6837\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa DressWild \u524d\u9988\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u59ff\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u4e143D\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ecfTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408\u540e\u9884\u6d4b2D\u7f1d\u7eab\u7eb8\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u5355\u56fe\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6216\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u9c81\u68d2\u6062\u590d\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f1d\u7eab\u7eb8\u6837\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e943D\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u591a\u5c42\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u3002", "conclusion": "DressWild \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u670d\u88c5\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Revocability is critical in privacy-sensitive applications where users or regulators may request removal of modality-specific information.

Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.

Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction.

As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

Moreover, optimizing for faithfulness and interpretability in reasoning often degrades task performance. To address this tradeoff and improve CoT faithfulness, we propose Reasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners (REMUL), a multi-party reinforcement learning approach. REMUL builds on the hypothesis that reasoning traces which other parties can follow will be more faithful. A speaker model generates a reasoning trace, which is truncated and passed to a pool of listener models who \"execute\" the trace, continuing the trace to an answer. Speakers are rewarded for producing reasoning that is clear to listeners, with additional correctness regularization via masked supervised finetuning to counter the tradeoff between faithfulness and performance. On multiple reasoning benchmarks (BIG-Bench Extra Hard, MuSR, ZebraLogicBench, and FOLIO), REMUL consistently and substantially improves three measures of faithfulness -- hint attribution, early answering area over the curve (AOC), and mistake injection AOC -- while also improving accuracy. Our analysis finds that these gains are robust across training domains, translate to legibility gains, and are associated with shorter and more direct CoTs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faREMUL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u542c\u4f17\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u5e38\u4e0d\u80fd\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u4e14\u63d0\u5347\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f80\u5f80\u635f\u5bb3\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReasoning Execution by Multiple Listeners\uff08REMUL\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u65b9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u88ab\u622a\u65ad\u540e\u4ea4\u7531\u591a\u4e2a\u542c\u4f17\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u5e76\u7eed\u5199\u81f3\u7b54\u6848\uff1b\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u4f9d\u636e\u542c\u4f17\u80fd\u5426\u6210\u529f\u6267\u884c\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u63a9\u7801\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u786e\u4fdd\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728BIG-Bench Extra Hard\u3001MuSR\u3001ZebraLogicBench\u548cFOLIO\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cREMUL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08hint attribution\u3001early answering AOC\u3001mistake injection AOC\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3001\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u77ed\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u3002", "conclusion": "REMUL\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u65e2\u53ef\u4fe1\u53c8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Reliably modeling dynamic obstacles and optimizing collision-free trajectories under perceptive and control uncertainty are challenging. This article focuses on revealing tight connection between reactive planning and dynamic mapping for manipulators from a model-based perspective. To enable efficient particle-based perception with expressively dynamic property, we present a tensorized particle weight update scheme that explicitly maintains obstacle velocities and covariance meanwhile. Building upon this dynamic representation, we propose an obstacle-aware MPPI-based planning formulation that jointly propagates robot-obstacle dynamics, allowing future system motion to be predicted and evaluated under uncertainty. The model predictive method is shown to significantly improve safety and reactivity with dynamic surroundings. By applying our complete framework in simulated and noisy real-world environments, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of robot-obstacle dynamics consistently enhances performance over state-of-the-art MPPI-based perception-planning baselines avoiding multiple static and dynamic obstacles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u969c\u788d\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u969c\u788d\u7269\u611f\u77e5\u7684MPPI\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u907f\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u7ef4\u62a4\u969c\u788d\u7269\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u969c\u788d\u7269\u611f\u77e5\u7684MPPI\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5668\u4eba-\u969c\u788d\u7269\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u53ca\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u9759\u6001/\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u89c4\u907f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eMPPI\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u4eba-\u969c\u788d\u7269\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5-\u89c4\u5212\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Narendra"], "title": "Linked Data Classification using Neurochaos Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Neurochaos Learning (NL) has shown promise in recent times over traditional deep learning due to its two key features: ability to learn from small sized training samples, and low compute requirements. In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet.

These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging.

Literary theory identifies uncertainty as a necessary condition for creative expression, while current alignment strategies steer models away from uncertain outputs to ensure factuality and reduce hallucination. We formalize this tension by quantifying the \"uncertainty gap\" between human-authored stories and model-generated continuations. Through a controlled information-theoretic analysis of 28 LLMs on high-quality storytelling datasets, we demonstrate that human writing consistently exhibits significantly higher uncertainty than model outputs. We find that instruction-tuned and reasoning models exacerbate this trend compared to their base counterparts; furthermore, the gap is more pronounced in creative writing than in functional domains, and strongly correlates to writing quality. Achieving human-level creativity requires new uncertainty-aware alignment paradigms that can distinguish between destructive hallucinations and the constructive ambiguity required for literary richness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5e73\u5eb8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u5199\u4f5c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u2018\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u2019\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0e\u5199\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u547c\u5401\u53d1\u5c55\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u6709\u5bb3\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u6709\u76ca\u6587\u5b66\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u521b\u9020\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u4fdd\u969c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u538b\u5236\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u9648\u8150\u523b\u677f\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e00\u77db\u76fe\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u2018\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6545\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf928\u4e2aLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f5c\u8005\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7eed\u5199\u6587\u672c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u5c42\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4eba\u7c7b\u5199\u4f5c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5LLM\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u62c9\u5927\u8be5\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u8be5\u5dee\u8ddd\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u6bd4\u529f\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5199\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u5448\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u65e2\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u5177\u6709\u6587\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5373\u521b\u9020\u6027\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff09\u3002"}}

Yu"], "title": "VIGOR: Visual Goal-In-Context Inference for Unified Humanoid Fall Safety", "comment": null, "summary": "Reliable fall recovery is critical for humanoids operating in cluttered environments. Unlike quadrupeds or wheeled robots, humanoids experience high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes during a fall, making recovery essential for continued operation. Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems such as fall avoidance, impact mitigation, and stand-up recovery, or rely on end-to-end policies trained without vision through reinforcement learning or imitation learning, often on flat terrain. At a deeper level, fall safety is treated as monolithic data complexity, coupling pose, dynamics, and terrain and requiring exhaustive coverage, limiting scalability and generalization. We present a unified fall safety approach that spans all phases of fall recovery. It builds on two insights: 1) Natural human fall and recovery poses are highly constrained and transferable from flat to complex terrain through alignment, and 2) Fast whole-body reactions require integrated perceptual-motor representations. We train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, and distill it into a deployable student that relies only on egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns how to react by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation, which combines the next target pose with the local terrain, rather than separately encoding what it must perceive and how it must act. Results in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments without real-world fine-tuning.

Existing neural operators, however, often suffer from instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon rollout, which stems from the unconstrained Euclidean latent space updates that violate the geometric and conservation laws. To address this challenge, we propose to constrain manifolds with low-rank Lie algebra parameterization that performs group action updates on the latent representation. Our method, termed Manifold Constraining based on Lie group (MCL), acts as an efficient \\emph{plug-and-play} module that enforces geometric inductive bias to existing neural operators. Extensive experiments on various partial differential equations, such as 1-D Burgers and 2-D Navier-Stokes, over a wide range of parameters and steps demonstrate that our method effectively lowers the relative prediction error by 30-50\\% at the cost of 2.26\\% of parameter increase.

Preprint submitted to Pattern Recognition Letters", "summary": "Despite the continuous research and evolution of language models, they sometimes underperform previous versions. Existing approaches to overcome these challenges are resource-intensive, highlighting the need for alternatives that enable immediate action. We assume that each language model has a local module inside that is suitable for a specific function. First, this work identifies a set of modules showing consistent and local activation changes under an inference workload through activation-based analysis. Subsequently, we transplant an internal module that is properly activated for a specific task into the target model, leading to immediate and measurable functional changes without additional training or fine-tuning. To experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the transplant technique, we quantify the relationship between transplant strength and performance improvement under different conditions for two language models. In the cross-generation setting, we find that transplanting activation-selected modules can substantially improve the underperforming model, reaching up to twice the target baseline and achieving gap-based recovery above 100%. Moreover, in transplant experiments between a base model and its instruction-tuned counterpart, transplantation improves the underperforming model toward the stronger baseline, yielding up to about 2.33 times the target baseline with gap-based recovery reaching up to 100% in the best case. These results show that meaningful capacity transfer can be realized through the implantation of highly localized modules implied by language models. Overall, this work provides empirical evidence for task-localized modularity in language models and presents a new research area: model transplantation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u2018\u6a21\u578b\u79fb\u690d\u2019\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8fc1\u79fb\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6b20\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u6a21\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u79fb\u690d\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u7acb\u5373\u751f\u6548\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u7279\u5f02\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u53ef\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u590d\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5c40\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4ece\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u4f55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u79fb\u690d\u4f7f\u6b20\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u76842\u500d\uff0cgap-based recovery\u8d85100%\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u79fb\u690d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ea62.33\u500d\uff0cgap-based recovery\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe100%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u4efb\u52a1\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u6a21\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u79fb\u690d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u6b63\u5f0f\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u6a21\u578b\u79fb\u690d\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this work, we consider the problem of range-aided decentralized localization and formation control. In such a setting, each robot estimates its relative pose by combining data only from onboard odometry sensors and distance measurements to other robots in the team. Additionally, each robot calculates the control inputs necessary to collaboratively navigate an environment to accomplish a specific task, for example, moving in a desired formation while monitoring an area. We present a block coordinate descent approach to localization that does not require strict coordination between the robots. We present a novel formulation for formation control as inference on factor graphs that takes into account the state estimation uncertainty and can be solved efficiently. Our approach to range-aided localization and formation-based navigation is completely decentralized, does not require specialized trajectories to maintain formation, and achieves decimeter-level positioning and formation control accuracy.

Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSelf-Supervised Semantic Bridge\uff08SSB\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u4f46\u5916\u89c2\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6865\u63a5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8de8\u57df\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6269\u6563\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u3001\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSSB\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u5bf9\u8868\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u57df\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSSB\u5728\u57df\u5185\u4e0e\u57df\u5916\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "SSB\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u3001\u65e0\u8de8\u57df\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

First, I analyze standard coreference evaluations and show that their design often leads to non-generalizable conclusions due to issues of measurement validity - including contestedness (multiple, competing definitions of coreference) and convergent validity (evaluation results that rank models differently across benchmarks). Second, I propose and implement a novel evaluation focused on testing systems' ability to infer the relative plausibility of events, a key aspect of resolving coreference. Through this extended evaluation, I find that contemporary language models demonstrate strong performance on standard benchmarks - improving over earlier baseline systems within certain domains and types of coreference - but remain sensitive to the evaluation conditions: they often fail to generalize in ways one would expect a human to be capable of when evaluation contexts are slightly modified. Taken together, these findings clarify both the strengths, such as improved accuracy over baselines on widely used evaluations, and the limitations of the current NLP paradigm, including weaknesses in measurement validity, and suggest directions for future work in developing better evaluation methods and more genuinely generalizable systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5171\u6307\u6d88\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0e\u51b2\u7a81\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5bf9\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u6d4b\u91cf\u6548\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5171\u6307\u6d88\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u6548\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u5171\u6307\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6392\u540d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6807\u51c6\u5171\u6307\u6d88\u89e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e00\u79cd\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5bf9\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u6d4b\u91cf\u6548\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dNLP\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u5171\u6307\u6d88\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u517c\u5177\u8fdb\u6b65\uff08\u5982\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff09\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff08\u5982\u6548\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u5f31\uff09\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

The accuracy of such a procedure is dictated by the system model fidelity and the sensor parameters, such as the accuracy of the sensor (as represented by its noise covariance) and the rate at which it can generate observations, referred to as the sensor query schedule. Intuitively, high-rate measurements from accurate sensors lead to accurate trajectory estimation. However, cost and resource constraints limit the sensor accuracy and its measurement rate. Our work's novel contribution is the estimation of sensor schedules and sensor covariances necessary to achieve a specific estimation accuracy. Concretely, we focus on estimating: (i) the rate or schedule with which a sensor of known covariance must generate measurements to achieve specific estimation accuracy, and alternatively, (ii) the sensor covariance necessary to achieve specific estimation accuracy for a given sensor update rate. We formulate the problem of estimating these sensor parameters as semidefinite programs, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. We validate our approach in simulation and real experiments by showing that the sensor schedules and the sensor covariances calculated using our proposed method achieve the desired trajectory estimation accuracy.

Evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, UCTECG-Net outperforms LSTM, CNN1D, and Transformer baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, achieving up to 98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH and 99.14% on PTB. To assess predictive reliability, we integrate three uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) into all models and analyze their behavior using an uncertainty-aware confusion matrix and derived metrics. The results show that UCTECG-Net, particularly with Ensemble or EMCD, provides more reliable and better-aligned uncertainty estimates than competing architectures, offering a stronger basis for risk-aware ECG decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUCTECG-Net\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u54081D\u5377\u79ef\u4e0eTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cbECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ca\u5176\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\uff1b\u5728MIT-BIH\u548cPTB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ECG\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUCTECG-Net\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e00\u7ef4\u5377\u79ef\u4e0eTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cbECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5176\u77ed\u65f6\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\uff1b\u96c6\u6210Monte Carlo Dropout\u3001Deep Ensembles\u548cEnsemble Monte Carlo Dropout\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u53ca\u884d\u751f\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIT-BIH Arrhythmia\u548cPTB Diagnostic\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cUCTECG-Net\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u6700\u9ad898.58%\u548c99.14%\uff09\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eLSTM\u3001CNN1D\u548c\u7eafTransformer\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u4f7f\u7528Ensemble\u6216EMCD\u65f6\uff09\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\u66f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "UCTECG-Net\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ECG\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u8bca\u65ad\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency.

While scaling has improved average-case performance, persistent failures on low-frequency, domain-specific, cultural, and temporal knowledge remain poorly characterized. This paper develops a structured taxonomy and analysis of long-Tail Knowledge in large language models, synthesizing prior work across technical and sociotechnical perspectives.\n  We introduce a structured analytical framework that synthesizes prior work across four complementary axes: how long-Tail Knowledge is defined, the mechanisms by which it is lost or distorted during training and inference, the technical interventions proposed to mitigate these failures, and the implications of these failures for fairness, accountability, transparency, and user trust. We further examine how existing evaluation practices obscure tail behavior and complicate accountability for rare but consequential failures. The paper concludes by identifying open challenges related to privacy, sustainability, and governance that constrain long-Tail Knowledge representation.

However, traditional freehand imaging procedure suffers from inconsistent, operator-dependent outcomes, lack of 3D localization information, and risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. While robotic ultrasound (RUS) systems offer the potential for standardized, operator-independent 3D kidney data acquisition, the existing scanning methods lack the ability to determine the optimal imaging window for efficient imaging. As a result, the scan is often blindly performed with excessive probe footprint, which frequently leads to acoustic shadowing and incomplete organ coverage. Consequently, there is a critical need for a spatially efficient imaging technique that can maximize the kidney coverage through minimum probe footprint. Here, we propose an autonomous workflow to achieve efficient kidney imaging via template-guided optimal pivoting. The system first performs an explorative imaging to generate partial observations of the kidney. This data is then registered to a kidney template to estimate the organ pose. With the kidney localized, the robot executes a fixed-point pivoting sweep where the imaging plane is aligned with the kidney long axis to minimize the probe translation. The proposed method was validated in simulation and in-vivo. Simulation results indicate that a 60% exploration ratio provides optimal balance between kidney localization accuracy and scanning efficiency. In-vivo evaluation on two male subjects demonstrates a kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees.

However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2.

However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors.

Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design.

However, redundancy and noise in time series, together with semantic gaps between non-adjacent scales, make the efficient alignment and integration of multi-scale temporal dependencies challenging. To address this, we propose SEMixer, a lightweight multiscale model designed for long-term TSF. SEMixer features two key components: a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC). RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance. We not only validate the effectiveness of SEMixer on 10 public datasets, but also on the \\textit{2025 CCF AlOps Challenge} based on 21GB real wireless network data, where SEMixer achieves third place.

Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08OC\uff09\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u7684VQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\uff08CLEVRTex\u3001Super-CLEVR\u548cMOVi-C\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86OC\u4e0e\u7a20\u5bc6\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5982DINOv2\u3001SigLIP2\uff09\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0OC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5c11\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f4e\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e30\u5bcc\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08OC\uff09\u8868\u793a\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u7684VQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff08CLEVRTex\u3001Super-CLEVR\u3001MOVi-C\uff09\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u4ee5DINOv2\u548cSigLIP2\u53ca\u5176OC\u53d8\u4f53\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09OC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u66f4\u96be\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7a20\u5bc6\u8868\u793a\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u7a20\u5bc6\u8868\u793a\u4ec5\u5728\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7565\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\uff083\uff09OC\u6a21\u578b\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0b\u5373\u8fbe\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u624d\u80fd\u8ffd\u5e73\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6216\u4e0b\u6e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4efb\u4e00\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We introduce the Multi-Check-Worthy (MultiCW) dataset, a balanced multilingual benchmark for check-worthy claim detection spanning 16 languages, 7 topical domains, and 2 writing styles. It consists of 123,722 samples, evenly distributed between noisy (informal) and structured (formal) texts, with balanced representation of check-worthy and non-check-worthy classes across all languages. To probe robustness, we also introduce an equally balanced out-of-distribution evaluation set of 27,761 samples in 4 additional languages. To provide baselines, we benchmark 3 common fine-tuned multilingual transformers against a diverse set of 15 commercial and open LLMs under zero-shot settings. Our findings show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot LLMs on claim classification and show strong out-of-distribution generalization across languages, domains, and styles.

While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEgoScale\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\uff0820854\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u2018\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3+\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u2019\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672c\u4f53\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u5426\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEgoScale\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\uff08>20,854\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3Vision Language Action (VLA)\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u7684log-linear scaling law\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3 + \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f22\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534754%\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u4f4e\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u673a\u68b0\u624b\u4e0a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u3001\u672c\u4f53\u65e0\u5173\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u662f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6e90\uff1bEgoScale\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u4eba\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002"}}

Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC).

To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness.

While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \\emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSaliency-Aware Principle (SAP)\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4ec5\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u63d0\u4f9b\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u4e14\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u957f\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u539f\u5219\u800c\u975e\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u54a8\u8be2\u4e0e\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u514d\u8d39\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "SAP\u5728\u540c\u7b49token\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8eCoT\u5f0f\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "SAP\u4e3aVLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u63a5\u5730\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

One class of benchmarks evaluates memorization by testing recall of past conversations or text but fails to capture how memory is used to guide future decisions. Another class focuses on agents acting in single-session tasks without the need for long-term memory. However, in realistic settings, memorization and action are tightly coupled: agents acquire memory while interacting with the environment, and subsequently rely on that memory to solve future tasks. To capture this setting, we introduce MemoryArena, a unified evaluation gym for benchmarking agent memory in multi-session Memory-Agent-Environment loops. The benchmark consists of human-crafted agentic tasks with explicitly interdependent subtasks, where agents must learn from earlier actions and feedback by distilling experiences into memory, and subsequently use that memory to guide later actions to solve the overall task. MemoryArena supports evaluation across web navigation, preference-constrained planning, progressive information search, and sequential formal reasoning, and reveals that agents with near-saturated performance on existing long-context memory benchmarks like LoCoMo perform poorly in our agentic setting, exposing a gap in current evaluations for agents with memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMemoryArena\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u5206\u5f00\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e8c\u8005\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaMemoryArena\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63d0\u70bc\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728LoCoMo\u7b49\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5728MemoryArena\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "MemoryArena\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6-\u884c\u52a8\u8054\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a parameterized canonical representation that unifies a broad spectrum of dexterous hand architectures. It comprises a unified parameter space and a canonical URDF format, offering three key advantages. 1) The parameter space captures essential morphological and kinematic variations for effective conditioning in learning algorithms. 2) A structured latent manifold can be learned over our space, where interpolations between embodiments yield smooth and physically meaningful morphology transitions. 3) The canonical URDF standardizes the action space while preserving dynamic and functional properties of the original URDFs, enabling efficient and reliable cross-embodiment policy learning. We validate these advantages through extensive analysis and experiments, including grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment zero-shot transfer. Specifically, we train a VAE on the unified representation to obtain a compact, semantically rich latent embedding, and develop a grasping policy conditioned on the canonical representation that generalizes across dexterous hands. We demonstrate, through simulation and real-world tasks on unseen morphologies (e.g., 81.9% zero-shot success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand), that our framework unifies both the representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands, providing a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u624b\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u79cd\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u624b\u90e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u65b0\u624b\u90e8\u5f62\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6URDF\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VAE\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6293\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u76843\u6307LEAP Hand\u5b9e\u73b081.9%\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u901a\u7528\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8de8\u624b\u90e8\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\\times$ faster encoding speeds. With our low memory usage, we are the first hypernetwork approach to demonstrate results at 480p, 720p and 1080p on UVG, HEVC and MCL-JCV.

These affordances enable ill-intended adversaries to also use these agents to carry out complex misuse scenarios. Existing agent misuse benchmarks largely test single-prompt instructions, leaving a gap in measuring how agents end up helping with harmful or illegal tasks over multiple turns. We introduce STING (Sequential Testing of Illicit N-step Goal execution), an automated red-teaming framework that constructs a step-by-step illicit plan grounded in a benign persona and iteratively probes a target agent with adaptive follow-ups, using judge agents to track phase completion. We further introduce an analysis framework that models multi-turn red-teaming as a time-to-first-jailbreak random variable, enabling analysis tools like discovery curves, hazard-ratio attribution by attack language, and a new metric: Restricted Mean Jailbreak Discovery. Across AgentHarm scenarios, STING yields substantially higher illicit-task completion than single-turn prompting and chat-oriented multi-turn baselines adapted to tool-using agents. In multilingual evaluations across six non-English settings, we find that attack success and illicit-task completion do not consistently increase in lower-resource languages, diverging from common chatbot findings.

To isolate the effect of agentic structure, we also develop a closely matched prompting-based baseline using the same model and instructions. Both methods are evaluated across three ABSA subtasks (Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), Aspect Sentiment Classification (ATSC), and Aspect Sentiment Pair Extraction (ASPE)), four SemEval datasets, and two encoder-decoder models: T5-Base and Tk-Instruct. Our results show that the agentic augmentation outperforms raw prompting in label preservation of the augmented data, especially when the tasks require aspect term generation.

We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26\u6709\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5956\u52b1\uff08CDR\uff09\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b24\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u2265MM\u7ea7\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eCDR\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u78c1\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u592a\u9633\u8000\u6591\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u2265MM\u7ea7\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u8bef\u5224\u4ee3\u4ef7\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u542bLOS\u4e0e\u77e2\u91cf\u78c1\u573a\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4CNN\u3001CNN-BiLSTM\u3001Transformer\u53ca\u5176CDR\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\u5f00\u5c55\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001SHAP\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u4e0eNASA/CCMC\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "CDR-Transformer\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1bR_VALUE\u4e0eAREA_ACR\u662f\u6700\u5173\u952eLOS\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u878d\u5408LOS\u4e0e\u77e2\u91cf\u78c1\u573a\u63d0\u5347Transformer\u6027\u80fd\uff1bCDR\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u5b9a\u9c81\u68d2\uff1bSHAP\u663e\u793aCDR\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8TOTUSJH\uff0cTransformer\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8R_VALUE\uff1bCDR-Transformer\u4f18\u4e8eNASA/CCMC\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8000\u6591\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0cCDR-Transformer\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

While convenient, this design makes deployments slow and expensive due to cumulative latency and token usage. We propose TabAgent, a framework for replacing generative decision components in closed-set selection tasks with a compact textual-tabular classifier trained on execution traces. TabAgent (i) extracts structured schema, state, and dependency features from trajectories (TabSchema), (ii) augments coverage with schema-aligned synthetic supervision (TabSynth), and (iii) scores candidates with a lightweight classifier (TabHead). On the long-horizon AppWorld benchmark, TabAgent maintains task-level success while eliminating shortlist-time LLM calls, reducing latency by approximately 95% and inference cost by 85-91%.

We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $\u03b5_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $\u03b5_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u5728\u7ebfQ\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u6298\u6263MDP\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e50\u89c2\u6027\u6216\u5956\u52b1\u9879\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u03b5-greedy\u4e0eBoltzmann\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3cO~(N^{9/10})\u7684\u95f4\u9699\u9c81\u68d2\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e0e\u65f6\u53d8\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u578b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Q\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9057\u61be\u5206\u6790\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e50\u89c2\u6027\u6216bonus\u9879\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6b21\u4f18\u95f4\u9699\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u523b\u753b\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u5177\u5907\u95f4\u9699\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u8870\u51cf\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684Boltzmann Q-learning\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51faSmoothed \u03b5_n-Greedy\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u03b5-greedy\u4e0eBoltzmann\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b3\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u9488\u5bf9\u65f6\u53d8\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u578b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "1\uff09Boltzmann Q-learning\u5728\u5927\u95f4\u9699\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u5c0f\u95f4\u9699\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u81f3\u7ebf\u6027\uff1b2\uff09Smoothed \u03b5_n-Greedy\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd1\u4f3cO~(N^{9/10})\u7684\u95f4\u9699\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4e2d\u6536\u7f29\u56e0\u5b50\u53ef\u968f\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u6e10\u8fd1\u8d8b\u4e8e1\uff0c\u5177\u72ec\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfQ\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u61be\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u4e50\u89c2\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u65b0\u578b\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0bonus\u3001\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u3001\u95f4\u9699\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5728\u7ebfQ\u5b66\u4e60\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Unlike synthetic benchmarks, IndicEval grounds evaluation in real examination standards, enabling realistic measurement of reasoning, domain knowledge, and bilingual adaptability. The framework automates assessment using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies and supports modular integration of new models and languages. Experiments conducted on Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA 3-70B reveal three major findings. First, CoT prompting consistently improves reasoning accuracy, with substantial gains across subjects and languages. Second, significant cross-model performance disparities persist, particularly in high-complexity examinations. Third, multilingual degradation remains a critical challenge, with marked accuracy drops in Hindi compared to English, especially under Zero-Shot conditions. These results highlight persistent gaps in bilingual reasoning and domain transfer. Overall, IndicEval provides a practice-oriented, extensible foundation for rigorous, equitable evaluation of LLMs in multilingual educational settings and offers actionable insights for improving reasoning robustness and language adaptability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86IndicEval\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u8003\u8bd5\u9898\uff08UPSC\u3001JEE\u3001NEET\uff09\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u82f1/\u5370\u5730\u8bed\uff09\u3001\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1LLM\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b66\u672f\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0CoT\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u5f31\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u53cc\u8bed\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u73b0\u5b58\u77ed\u677f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u672f\u573a\u666f\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u6620\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u7b49\u591a\u8bed\u6559\u80b2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaIndicEval\u57fa\u51c6\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6574\u5408UPSC\u3001JEE\u3001NEET\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8003\u9898\uff08STEM\u4e0e\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\uff0c\u82f1\u6587\u4e0e\u5370\u5730\u8bed\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Zero-Shot\u3001Few-Shot\u4e0eChain-of-Thought\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "1\uff09CoT\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u5404\u5b66\u79d1\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff08Gemini 2.0 Flash\u3001GPT-4\u3001Claude\u3001LLaMA 3-70B\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff1b3\uff09\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u52a3\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u9000\u5316\u5c24\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002", "conclusion": "IndicEval\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cc\u8bed\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions.

However, translated text differs systematically from native text. This phenomenon is known as translationese, and it reflects both traces of the source language and characteristic properties of translation itself. In this paper, we study how training on machine-translated data affects small English language models, focusing on how translationese from different source languages shapes linguistic acceptability judgments and language modelling for different domains. We train models on English text translated from 24 typologically and resource-diverse source languages, enabling a systematic analysis of how source language and corpus properties influence what models learn. Our results show that the source language has a clear impact on model behavior: general perplexity is more driven by the lexical diversity of the translated corpus, while grammatical performance is strongly correlated to typological similarity to English, given enough data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\uff08translationese\uff09\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5206\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00NLP\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u6bcd\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5373translationese\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684translationese\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bed\u6cd5\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6765\u81ea24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u5404\u5f02\u7684\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u82f1\u8bd1\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3001\u8bed\u6cd5\u5224\u65ad\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u6574\u4f53\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bed\u6599\u8bcd\u6c47\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u5219\u4e0e\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u6570\u636e\u5145\u8db3\u65f6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "translationese\u5e76\u975e\u5747\u8d28\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u4f1a\u5b9a\u5411\u5851\u9020\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u9700\u8003\u8651\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Naive methods -- like applying MLPs to flattened parameters -- perform poorly, making the design of better weight-space architectures a central challenge. While prior work leveraged permutation symmetries in standard networks to guide such designs, no analogous analysis or tailored architecture yet exists for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures. We construct a comprehensive ``zoo'' of trained KANs spanning diverse tasks, which we use as benchmarks to empirically evaluate WS-KAN. Across all tasks, WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines, often by a substantial margin.

They are rarely proactive in soliciting this feedback, even when faced with ambiguity, which can make their dialogues feel static, one-sided, and lacking the adaptive qualities of human conversation. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from social meta-learning (SML) in humans - the process of learning how to learn from others. We formulate SML as a finetuning methodology, training LLMs to solicit and learn from language feedback in simulated pedagogical dialogues, where static tasks are converted into interactive social learning problems. SML effectively teaches models to use conversation to solve problems they are unable to solve in a single turn. This capability generalises across domains; SML on math problems produces models that better use feedback to solve coding problems and vice versa. Furthermore, despite being trained only on fully-specified problems, these models are better able to solve underspecified tasks where critical information is revealed over multiple turns. When faced with this ambiguity, SML-trained models make fewer premature answer attempts and are more likely to ask for the information they need.

We provide a mechanistic unification: looped and depth-grown models exhibit convergent depth-wise signatures, including increased reliance on late layers and recurring patterns aligned with the looped or grown block. These shared signatures support the view that their gains stem from a common form of iterative computation. Building on this connection, we show that the two techniques are adaptable and composable: applying inference-time looping to the middle blocks of a depth-grown model improves accuracy on some reasoning primitives by up to $2\\times$, despite the model never being trained to loop. Both approaches also adapt better than the baseline when given more in-context examples or additional supervised fine-tuning data. Additionally, depth-grown models achieve the largest reasoning gains when using higher-quality, math-heavy cooldown mixtures, which can be further boosted by adapting a middle block to loop.

However, soft prompts rely on high-dimensional, implicit representations and lack explicit semantics and traceable training behaviors, which limits their interpretability. To address this limitation, we propose a soft prompt tuning optimization method based on topological morphological evolution. Specifically, we employ persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to quantify the structural representations of soft prompts in continuous parameter space and their training process evolution. Quantitative analysis shows that topologically stable and compact soft prompts achieve better downstream performance. Based on this empirical observation, we construct a loss function for optimizing soft prompt tuning, termed Topological Soft Prompt Loss (TSLoss). TSLoss guides the model to learn structurally stable adaptations by quantifying inter-parameter connectivity and redundancy. Extensive experiments show that training with TSLoss accelerates convergence and improves tuning performance, providing an interpretable method to understand and optimize soft prompt tuning from structural and topological perspectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\u91cf\u5316\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u635f\u5931\uff08TSLoss\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff08TDA\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u62d3\u6251\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u635f\u5931\uff08TSLoss\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTSLoss\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d3\u6251\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0cTSLoss\u4e3a\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Applying the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) schema to the multilingual ParlaMint corpus of over 8 million speeches from 28 parliaments of European countries and autonomous regions, we follow a teacher-student framework in which a high-performing large language model (LLM) annotates in-domain training data and a multilingual encoder model is fine-tuned on these annotations for scalable data annotation. We show that this approach produces a classifier tailored to the target domain. Agreement between the LLM and human annotators is comparable to inter-annotator agreement among humans, and the resulting model outperforms existing CAP classifiers trained on manually-annotated but out-of-domain data. In addition to the CAP annotations, the ParlaCAP dataset offers rich speaker and party metadata, as well as sentiment predictions coming from the ParlaSent multilingual transformer model, enabling comparative research on political attention and representation across countries. We illustrate the analytical potential of the dataset with three use cases, examining the distribution of parliamentary attention across policy topics, sentiment patterns in parliamentary speech, and gender differences in policy attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ParlaCAP\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6b27\u6d32\u8bae\u4f1a\u8bae\u7a0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CAP\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u57df\u5916\uff08out-of-domain\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u8bae\u4f1a\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u8bae\u9898\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bae\u4f1a\u53d1\u8a00\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u56fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u2018\u6559\u5e08\u2019\uff0c\u5728ParlaMint\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bae\u4f1a\u8bed\u6599\uff08800\u4e07\u6761\u6f14\u8bb2\uff09\u4e0a\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210CAP schema\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u518d\u4ee5\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5982mBERT/XLM-R\uff09\u4e3a\u2018\u5b66\u751f\u2019\uff0c\u5728LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u96c6\u6210ParlaSent\u60c5\u611f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e30\u5bcc\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba-\u4eba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08inter-annotator agreement\uff09\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728CAP\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u8bae\u4f1a\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1bParlaCAP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u542bCAP\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba/\u515a\u6d3e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u60c5\u611f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u652f\u6491\u4e09\u9879\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7528\u4f8b\uff08\u8bae\u9898\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "ParlaCAP\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bae\u4f1a\u653f\u7b56\u8bae\u9898\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u6807\u6ce8\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u6587\u672c\u9886\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8bae\u7a0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0e\u653f\u6cbb\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u8de8\u56fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u65b0\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness inherent to sPA imaging, concentration estimation is intractable. The Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) aims to address the sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity.

In mathematics tutoring transcripts, numeric expressions frequently resemble structured identifiers (e.g., dates or IDs), leading generic Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection systems to over-redact core instructional content and reduce dataset utility. This work asks how PII can be detected in math tutoring transcripts while preserving their educational utility. To address this challenge, we investigate the \"numeric ambiguity\" problem and introduce MathEd-PII, the first benchmark dataset for PII detection in math tutoring dialogues, created through a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that audits upstream redactions and generates privacy-preserving surrogates. The dataset contains 1,000 tutoring sessions (115,620 messages; 769,628 tokens) with validated PII annotations. Using a density-based segmentation method, we show that false PII redactions are disproportionately concentrated in math-dense regions, confirming numeric ambiguity as a key failure mode. We then compare four detection strategies: a Presidio baseline and LLM-based approaches with basic, math-aware, and segment-aware prompting. Math-aware prompting substantially improves performance over the baseline (F1: 0.821 vs. 0.379) while reducing numeric false positives, demonstrating that de-identification must incorporate domain context to preserve analytic utility. This work provides both a new benchmark and evidence that utility-preserving de-identification for tutoring data requires domain-aware modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMathEd-PII\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dPII\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5220\u6559\u5b66\u5173\u952e\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528PII\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u56e0\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6613\u88ab\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u8eab\u4efd\u6807\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u65e5\u671f\u3001ID\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8131\u654f\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u6559\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684PII\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6MathEd-PII\uff08\u542b1000\u573a\u4f1a\u8bdd\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540cLLM\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u66ff\u4ee3\u9879\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u7ea2\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4Presidio\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u57fa\u7840/\u6570\u5b66\u611f\u77e5/\u5206\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08F1\uff1a0.821 vs. 0.379\uff09\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u5b57\u7c7b\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff1b\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6570\u503c\u6b67\u4e49\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u5b66\u5bc6\u96c6\u533a\u57df\u8bef\u5220\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u5411\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u578b\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u5fc5\u987b\u878d\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6559\u80b2\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u5171\u4eab\u3002"}}

In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $\u03b5$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $\u03b5$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $\u03b5$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed.

Automatic summarization can help address this challenge by producing concise summaries for each discussion subject. Despite its potential, research on summarizing discussion subjects in municipal meeting minutes remains largely unexplored, especially in low-resource languages, where the inherent complexity of these documents adds further challenges. A major bottleneck is the scarcity of datasets containing high-quality, manually crafted summaries, which limits the development and evaluation of effective summarization models for this domain. In this paper, we present CitiLink-Summ, a new corpus of European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes, comprising 100 documents and 2,322 manually hand-written summaries, each corresponding to a distinct discussion subject. Leveraging this dataset, we establish baseline results for automatic summarization in this domain, employing state-of-the-art generative models (e.g., BART, PRIMERA) as well as large language models (LLMs), evaluated with both lexical and semantic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore. CitiLink-Summ provides the first benchmark for municipal-domain summarization in European Portuguese, offering a valuable resource for advancing NLP research on complex administrative texts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CitiLink-Summ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6b27\u6d32\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u7eaa\u8981\u4e3b\u9898\u6458\u8981\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u7eaa\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u5197\u957f\u96be\u61c2\uff0c\u516c\u6c11\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u800c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u6b27\u6d32\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\uff09\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6458\u8981\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b100\u4efd\u4f1a\u8bae\u7eaa\u8981\u30012322\u6761\u4eba\u5de5\u64b0\u5199\u4e3b\u9898\u6458\u8981\u7684CitiLink-Summ\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1b\u91c7\u7528BART\u3001PRIMERA\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528ROUGE\u3001BLEU\u3001METEOR\u548cBERTScore\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6b27\u6d32\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u5e02\u653f\u9886\u57df\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "CitiLink-Summ\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u653f\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u590d\u6742\u653f\u52a1\u6587\u6863\u7684NLP\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Existing explainability methods rely on final-layer attributions, capture either local token-level attributions or global attention patterns without unification, and lack context-awareness of inter-token dependencies and structural components. They also fail to capture how relevance evolves across layers and how structural components shape decision-making. To address these limitations, we proposed the \\textbf{Context-Aware Layer-wise Integrated Gradients (CA-LIG) Framework}, a unified hierarchical attribution framework that computes layer-wise Integrated Gradients within each Transformer block and fuses these token-level attributions with class-specific attention gradients. This integration yields signed, context-sensitive attribution maps that capture supportive and opposing evidence while tracing the hierarchical flow of relevance through the Transformer layers. We evaluate the CA-LIG Framework across diverse tasks, domains, and transformer model families, including sentiment analysis and long and multi-class document classification with BERT, hate speech detection in a low-resource language setting with XLM-R and AfroLM, and image classification with Masked Autoencoder vision Transformer model. Across all tasks and architectures, CA-LIG provides more faithful attributions, shows stronger sensitivity to contextual dependencies, and produces clearer, more semantically coherent visualizations than established explainability methods. These results indicate that CA-LIG provides a more comprehensive, context-aware, and reliable explanation of Transformer decision-making, advancing both the practical interpretability and conceptual understanding of deep neural models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5c42\u79ef\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\uff08CA-LIG\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5f52\u56e0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u5c42\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u79ef\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u5f52\u56e0\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u4e14\u4e0d\u80fd\u523b\u753b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5728\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCA-LIG\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2aTransformer\u5757\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u79ef\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06token\u7ea7\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0e\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u68af\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u3001\u957f\u6587\u6863\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff08BERT\u3001XLM-R\u3001AfroLM\u3001MAE-ViT\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cCA-LIG\u5f52\u56e0\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3001\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u66f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "conclusion": "CA-LIG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684Transformer\u51b3\u7b56\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6027\u522b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u5176\u4ed6\u672a\u76ee\u6807\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6ea2\u51fa\uff08bias spillover\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u53cd\u800c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5916\u8c8c\u3001\u6027\u53d6\u5411\u548c\u6b8b\u969c\u72b6\u6001\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5355\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6027\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u672a\u88ab\u5173\u6ce8\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6ea2\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5728LLM\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Mistral 7B\u3001Llama 3.1 8B\u548cQwen 2.5 7B\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eBBQ\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u660e\u786e\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u4e5d\u4e2a\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u663e\u8457\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6ea2\u51fa\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u6574\u4f53\u6307\u6807\u6539\u5584\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5916\u8c8c\uff08p<0.001\uff09\u3001\u6027\u53d6\u5411\u548c\u6b8b\u969c\u72b6\u6001\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u5355\u4e00\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u5176\u4ed6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fc5\u987b\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u5c5e\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u534f\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u504f\u89c1\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0e\u9690\u6027\u6b67\u89c6\u52a0\u5267\u3002"}}

LLM-as-a-jury for Comparative Assessment", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied as automatic evaluators for natural language generation assessment often using pairwise comparative judgements. Existing approaches typically rely on single judges or aggregate multiple judges assuming equal reliability. In practice, LLM judges vary substantially in performance across tasks and aspects, and their judgment probabilities may be biased and inconsistent. Furthermore, human-labelled supervision for judge calibration may be unavailable. We first empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in LLM comparison probabilities exist and show that it limits the effectiveness of direct probability-based ranking. To address this, we study the LLM-as-a-jury setting and propose BT-sigma, a judge-aware extension of the Bradley-Terry model that introduces a discriminator parameter for each judge to jointly infer item rankings and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons alone. Experiments on benchmark NLG evaluation datasets show that BT-sigma consistently outperforms averaging-based aggregation methods, and that the learned discriminator strongly correlates with independent measures of the cycle consistency of LLM judgments. Further analysis reveals that BT-sigma can be interpreted as an unsupervised calibration mechanism that improves aggregation by modelling judge reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBT-sigma\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5224\u522b\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u5efa\u6a21LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u88c1\u5224\u65f6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u6392\u5e8f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709LLM\u88c1\u5224\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5176\u5224\u65ad\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7528\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBT-sigma\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u88c1\u5224\u611f\u77e5\u7684Bradley-Terry\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u6570\u636e\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\u9879\u76ee\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u6bcf\u4e2aLLM\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u5224\u522b\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5373\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728NLG\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cBT-sigma\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6240\u5b66\u5224\u522b\u53c2\u6570\u4e0eLLM\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6307\u6807\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "BT-sigma\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21LLM\u88c1\u5224\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u5e8f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling.

We introduce the Adversarial Resource Extraction Game (AREG), a benchmark that operationalizes persuasion and resistance as a multi-turn, zero-sum negotiation over financial resources. Using a round-robin tournament across frontier models, AREG enables joint evaluation of offensive (persuasion) and defensive (resistance) capabilities within a single interactional framework. Our analysis provides evidence that these capabilities are weakly correlated ($\u03c1= 0.33$) and empirically dissociated: strong persuasive performance does not reliably predict strong resistance, and vice versa. Across all evaluated models, resistance scores exceed persuasion scores, indicating a systematic defensive advantage in adversarial dialogue settings. Further linguistic analysis suggests that interaction structure plays a central role in these outcomes. Incremental commitment-seeking strategies are associated with higher extraction success, while verification-seeking responses are more prevalent in successful defenses than explicit refusal. Together, these findings indicate that social influence in LLMs is not a monolithic capability and that evaluation frameworks focusing on persuasion alone may overlook asymmetric behavioral vulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u63d0\u53d6\u6e38\u620f\uff08AREG\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8bf4\u670d\u4e0e\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8c\u8005\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u523b\u753bLLM\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u8bf4\u670d\u4e0e\u62b5\u6297\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96f6\u548c\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u8c08\u5224\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684Adversarial Resource Extraction Game\uff08AREG\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u8d5b\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5316\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u627f\u8bfa\u5bfb\u6c42\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bfb\u6c42\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8bf4\u670d\u4e0e\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u03c1=0.33\uff09\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u5f97\u5206\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e\u8bf4\u670d\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u627f\u8bfa\u5bfb\u6c42\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u63d0\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bfb\u6c42\u5f0f\u56de\u5e94\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u62d2\u7edd\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u6210\u529f\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u7ef4\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u805a\u7126\u8bf4\u670d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1bAREG\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u53cc\u5411\u793e\u4f1a\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Quecto-V1, a domain-specific Small Language Model (SLM) engineered to democratize access to Indian legal intelligence. Built upon a custom configuration of the GPT-2 architecture (124 million parameters), Quecto-V1 was trained from scratch exclusively on a corpus of Indian statutes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and the Constitution of India. Unlike generalist models, which prioritize broad world knowledge, our approach maximizes \"lexical density\" within the legal domain. Furthermore, we address the deployment bottleneck by applying post-training 8-bit quantization (GGUF format), compressing the model to a memory footprint of under 150 MB. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that Quecto-V1 achieves high fidelity in retrieving statutory definitions and penal provisions, outperforming general-purpose SLMs in domain-specific exact match tasks while running entirely offline on consumer-grade CPUs. We further present an ablation study showing that 8-bit quantization yields a 74% reduction in model size with less than 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy compared to full-precision baselines. These findings suggest that for specialized, high-stakes domains like law, domain-specific training coupled with aggressive quantization offers a viable, privacy-preserving alternative to monolithic cloud models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Quecto-V1\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08124M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-2\u67b6\u6784\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5370\u5ea6\u6210\u6587\u6cd5\u8bed\u6599\uff1b\u901a\u8fc78\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u81f3150MB\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u79bb\u7ebfCPU\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u6cd5\u5b9a\u6761\u6b3e\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u901a\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4e3b\u6743\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9020\u6210\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u9e3f\u6c9f\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff087B+\uff09\u548c\u4e91\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u6570\u636e\u4e3b\u6743\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bQuecto-V1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u5236\u5316GPT-2\u67b6\u6784\uff08124M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8e\u5370\u5ea6\u6210\u6587\u6cd5\u8bed\u6599\uff08IPC\u3001CrPC\u3001\u5baa\u6cd5\uff09\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u8bad\u7ec38\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\uff08GGUF\u683c\u5f0f\uff09\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u90e8\u7f72\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "result": "Quecto-V1\u5728\u6cd5\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u5211\u7f5a\u6761\u6b3e\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef<150MB\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7CPU\u79bb\u7ebf\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b8\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef\u51cf\u5c1174%\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d<3.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u9ad8\u3001\u5bb9\u9519\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u5408\u6fc0\u8fdb\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4f18\u5148\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u5de8\u578b\u4e91\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLoRSum\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u66f4\u65b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3LoRA\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8fd1\u7aef\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86LoRA\u4e0e\u5168\u6b65\u957f\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\uff08SVDLoRA\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u79e9\u52a8\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u5168\u6b65\u957f\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\uff08SVDLoRA\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301LoRA\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoRSum\u5b50\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5c06LoRA\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fd1\u7aef\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u5757\u5e42\u6cd5\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u652f\u6301K-FAC\u3001Shampoo\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u7248\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3001CIFAR-100\u3001GLUE\u3001SQuAD v2\u548cWikiText-103\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLoRSum\u5728\u5c0f\u5e45\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8aLoRA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u77e9\u9635SVD\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRSum\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u7684LoRA\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u79e9\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a resource-efficient method for improving multilingual safety alignment. We introduce a plug-and-play Multi-Lingual Consistency (MLC) loss that can be integrated into existing monolingual alignment pipelines. By improving collinearity between multilingual representation vectors, our method encourages directional consistency at the multilingual semantic level in a single update. This allows simultaneous alignment across multiple languages using only multilingual prompt variants without requiring additional response-level supervision in low-resource languages. We validate the proposed method across different model architectures and alignment paradigms, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing multilingual safety with limited impact on general model utility.

To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework.

In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is uncertain about the correctness of that code; the cost of writing a test is nonzero, but typically lower than the cost of making a mistake. In this work, we show that we can induce LLMs to explicitly reason about balancing these cost-uncertainty tradeoffs, then perform more optimal environment exploration. We formalize multiple tasks, including information retrieval and coding, as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. Each problem has latent environment state that can be reasoned about via a prior which is passed to the LLM agent. We introduce a framework called Calibrate-Then-Act (CTA), where we feed the LLM this additional context to enable it to act more optimally. This improvement is preserved even under RL training of both the baseline and CTA.

However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference.

We propose \\emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting.

In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval.

We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \\(\u03bb\\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \\(5\\times10^{-4}\\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \\(10^{-4}\\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\\% and 99\\% success) and Bell states (between 61\\% and 77\\% success). However, scalability saturates for \\(\u03bb\\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \\(\u03bb=2\\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime.

It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u4f4f\u5b85\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7535\u7f51\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u65f6\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d39\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5cf0\u503c\u8d1f\u8377\u5e76\u5e73\u6ed1\u603b\u8d1f\u8377\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u7ef4\u6301\u7535\u7f51\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u62e5\u585e\uff0c\u5e76\u517c\u987e\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e0e\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u7535\u4ef7\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8377\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u504f\u597d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u6839\u636e\u6279\u53d1\u7535\u4ef7\u548c\u805a\u5408\u4f4f\u5b85\u8d1f\u8377\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d39\u7387\uff1b\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u5f02\u8d28\u504f\u597d\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u5bb6\u7535\u7ea7\u5bb6\u5ead\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u6210\u672c\uff09\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u5b9e\u65f6\u6fc0\u52b1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u7528\u7535\u4e0e\u7535\u4ef7\u6570\u636e\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5cf0\u503c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u5cf0\u5747\u6bd4\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea622.82%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6fc0\u52b1\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u7535\u7f51\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f9b\u9700\u53cc\u65b9\u5171\u8d62\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing KAN architectures, including spline-, wavelet-, radial-basis variants, etc., suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting scalability and practical applicability. Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures.

Specifically, if the pretrained models are overparameterized, using sufficiently many of them is important for beneficial transfer learning. However, the learning may be compromised by overparameterization bias of pretrained models, i.e., the minimum $\\ell_2$-norm solution's restriction to a small subspace spanned by the training examples in the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose a simple debiasing via multiplicative correction factor that can reduce the overparameterization bias and leverage more pretrained models to learn a target predictor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e26\u8ddd\u79bb\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u7684\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e58\u6027\u6821\u6b63\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e73\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bef\u5dee\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e58\u6027\u6821\u6b63\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6709\u76ca\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u2113\u2082-\u8303\u6570\u89e3\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5f20\u6210\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u5236\u7ea6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e58\u6027\u6821\u6b63\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics.

While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08VQCs\uff09\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u867d\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5374\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u2019\uff0c\u8bef\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u8d8a\u591a\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u8d8a\u5f3a\u3001\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4Adam/SGD\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u5728VQCs\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u2018\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\u2019\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5f71\u54cd\uff08\u5982\u68af\u5ea6\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u68af\u5ea6\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u5e45\u503c\u8d8a\u5927\u3001\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff1b\u7ecf\u5178\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08Adam\u3001SGD\uff09\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u663e\u8457\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u8def\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u5267\u589e\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u867d\u6709\u76ca\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5374\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u517c\u987e\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u9002\u914d\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.\n  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\\star}(x) \\propto p(x) \\exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\\top A x + b^\\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u503e\u659c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8d1f\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u503e\u659c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b97\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5176\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u88ab\u9ad8\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Hubbard-Stratonovich\u53d8\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u603b\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u503e\u659c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u8d1f\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u503e\u659c\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u79e9\u4e3a1\uff09\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u7b26\u53f7\u4e0e\u79e9\uff09\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e00\u6982\u800c\u8bba\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility.

This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AIFL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLSTM\u7684\u5168\u7403\u65e5\u5c3a\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f84\u6d41\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5148\u5728ERA5-Land\u518d\u5728IFS\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u7f13\u89e3\u518d\u5206\u6790\u5230\u4e1a\u52a1\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728CARAVAN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u4e1a\u52a1\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u7403\u5f84\u6d41\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9632\u6d2a\u548c\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAIFL\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eLSTM\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5168\u7403\u65e5\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f84\u6d41\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u5148\u57281980\u20132019\u5e74ERA5-Land\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u57282016\u20132019\u5e74IFS\u4e1a\u52a1\u9884\u62a5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81eaCARAVAN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u768418,588\u4e2a\u6d41\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u57282021\u20132024\u5e74\u72ec\u7acb\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u4fee\u6b63KGE'\u8fbe0.66\u3001\u4e2d\u4f4dNSE\u8fbe0.53\uff1b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5168\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e14\u5f3a\u8feb\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7a0b\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "AIFL\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728CARAVAN\u751f\u6001\u5185\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6c34\u6587AI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u6c34\u6587\u5b66\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u4e1a\u52a1\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\uff08MI\uff09\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5SeMI*\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u6a21\u578b\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u9700\u5229\u7528\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u5347MI\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6700\u4f18MI\u653b\u51fbSeMI*\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5e26/\u4e0d\u5e26\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u63d2\u5165\u65f6\u673a\u4e0e\u2018\u91d1\u4e1d\u96c0\u2019\u6837\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "SeMI*\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684MI\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a00\u91ca\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u6db5\u76d6\u5df2\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548cDP-SGD\u8bad\u7ec3/\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u5e8f\u5217\u53ef\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684MI\u653b\u51fb\u4e0e\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0cSeMI*\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u56fe\u7684\u8b66\u5bdf\u6570\uff08cop number\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5747\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u56fe\u7684\u8b66\u5bdf\u6570\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u8b66\u5bdf\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6811\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u5bf9\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1bGNN\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u5373\u8fbe\u76f8\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6700\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5305\u62ec\u8282\u70b9\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u56e2\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u8b66\u5bdf\u6570\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock.

Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results.

While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u4e0e\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u9000\u706b\uff08FMQA\uff09\u7684RNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u5230\u6574\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u53ca\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0domain-wall\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u5408G/C\u7f6e\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u6574\u6570\u65f6\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u800cFMQA\u867d\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaFMQA\u6846\u67b6\u6c42\u89e3RNA\u9006\u6298\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7f16\u7801\uff08one-hot\u3001binary\u3001unary\u3001domain-wall\uff09\uff0c\u7a77\u4e3e24\u79cd\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u2192\u6574\u6570(0\u20133)\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "domain-wall\u548cone-hot\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7cfb\u7efc\u7f3a\u9677\u503c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8ebinary\u548cunary\uff1bdomain-wall\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u6574\u6570\uff080/3\uff09\u5bf9\u5e94\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u5c06G/C\u5206\u914d\u81f3\u8fb9\u754c\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u830e\u533aG/C\u5bcc\u96c6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4one-hot\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u5206\u914d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdFMQA\u6c42\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff1bdomain-wall\u7f16\u7801\u914d\u5408G/C\u7f6e\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u6574\u6570\u662f\u66f4\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3aRNA\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $\u03c9(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests.

Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u9677\u5165\u975e\u6cdb\u5316\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u65ad\u8a00\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u501f\u52a9Pearl\u56e0\u679c\u5c42\u6b21\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u89c2\u5bdf\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u4e0e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e09\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u524d\u63d0\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7ed3\u8bba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u8d85\u51fa\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89c4\u8303\u4e3b\u5f20\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePearl\u56e0\u679c\u5c42\u6b21\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u533a\u5206\u89c2\u5bdf\uff08associations\uff09\u3001\u5e72\u9884\uff08interventions\uff0c\u5982ablation\u3001activation patching\uff09\u4e0e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff08counterfactuals\uff09\u4e09\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e/\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u5b9e\u8df5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u80fd\u652f\u6491\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c42\u7ea7\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e3b\u5f20\u5728\u65e0\u53d7\u63a7\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1bCRL\u4e3a\u53d8\u91cf\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u4e3b\u5f20\u5f3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u56e0\u679c\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0eCRL\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f15\u5165LLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u79d1\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ee1\u8db3CRL\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u66f4\u5f3a\u56e0\u679c\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002"}}

However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff08\u5982\u4e34\u5e8a\u6982\u5ff5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u6765\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff09\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u77e9\u9635\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff08\u6837\u672c\u5c11\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u6781\u591a\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u800c\u5916\u90e8\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u65e5\u76ca\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5217\u5d4c\u5165\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08RKHS\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u6ed1\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u6838PCA\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u6838\u6295\u5f71\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u9762\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9eEHR\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u9ad8\u7ef4\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}
