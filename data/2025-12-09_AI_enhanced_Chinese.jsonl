Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. The crucial step in this iterative process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals, however, remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a holistic model that encompasses agent bounded rationality and uncertainty and developing AI models to generate such compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaboratively writing text documents -- e.g., to enable the democratic creation of a community constitution. We apply NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques and utilize LLMs (Large Language Models) to create a semantic metric space for text and develop algorithms to suggest suitable compromise points. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we simulate various coalition formation processes and demonstrate the potential of AI to facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, such as collaboratively drafting a constitution, an area where traditional tools are limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408NLP\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u793e\u533a\u5baa\u6cd5\u8d77\u8349\uff09\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6570\u652f\u6301\u7684\u59a5\u534f\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u5546\u4e2d\u7684\u59a5\u534f\u70b9\u53d1\u73b0\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728AI\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u3001\u8c03\u89e3\u548c\u8c08\u5224\u7b49\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u627e\u5230\u80fd\u4fc3\u6210\u8054\u76df\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u59a5\u534f\u63d0\u6848\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u6587\u672c\u521b\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u878d\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5229\u7528NLP\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u5c45\u4e2d\u7684\u59a5\u534f\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u79cd\u8054\u76df\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u88ab\u591a\u6570\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u59a5\u534f\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51faAI\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6c11\u4e3b\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u59a5\u534f\u63d0\u6848\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u5199\u4f5c\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u6c11\u4e3b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, evaluating each individual agent's effectiveness and online optimization of underperforming agents remain open challenges. To address these issues, we present HiveMind, a self-adaptive framework designed to optimize LLM multi-agent collaboration through contribution analysis. At its core, HiveMind introduces Contribution-Guided Online Prompt Optimization (CG-OPO), which autonomously refines agent prompts based on their quantified contributions. We first propose the Shapley value as a grounded metric to quantify each agent's contribution, thereby identifying underperforming agents in a principled manner for automated prompt refinement. To overcome the computational complexity of the classical Shapley value, we present DAG-Shapley, a novel and efficient attribution algorithm that leverages the inherent Directed Acyclic Graph structure of the agent workflow to axiomatically prune non-viable coalitions. By hierarchically reusing intermediate outputs of agents in the DAG, our method further reduces redundant computations, and achieving substantial cost savings without compromising the theoretical guarantees of Shapley values. Evaluated in a multi-agent stock-trading scenario, HiveMind achieves superior performance compared to static baselines. Notably, DAG-Shapley reduces LLM calls by over 80\\% while maintaining attribution accuracy comparable to full Shapley values, establishing a new standard for efficient credit assignment and enabling scalable, real-world optimization of multi-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HiveMind\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eShapley\u503c\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5DAG-Shapley\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u80a1\u7968\u4ea4\u6613\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u8282\u770180%\u4ee5\u4e0aLLM\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHiveMind\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u4e8eShapley\u503c\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u5f52\u56e0\u7b97\u6cd5DAG-Shapley\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u975e\u53ef\u884c\u8054\u76df\uff0c\u5e76\u590d\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d21\u732e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff08CG-OPO\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80a1\u7968\u4ea4\u6613\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cHiveMind\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1bDAG-Shapley\u5728\u4fdd\u6301Shapley\u503c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8580%\u7684LLM\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u5f52\u56e0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u6574Shapley\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "HiveMind\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0cDAG-Shapley\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfShapley\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

ChargingBoul employs a lightweight yet effective strategy that balances concession and opponent modeling to achieve high negotiation outcomes. The agent classifies opponents based on bid patterns, dynamically adjusts its bidding strategy, and applies a concession policy in later negotiation stages to maximize utility while fostering agreements. We evaluate ChargingBoul's performance using competition results and subsequent studies that have utilized the agent in negotiation research.

Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers promising capabilities for traffic signal control, ensuring safety in such environments remains difficult. As a direct indicator of traffic risk, the collision rate must be well understood and incorporated into traffic control design. This study investigates the primary factors influencing collision rates in a MARL-governed Mixed Traffic Control (MTC) network. We examine three dimensions: total vehicle count, signalized versus unsignalized intersection configurations, and turning-movement strategies. Through controlled simulation experiments, we evaluate how each factor affects collision likelihood. The results show that collision rates are sensitive to traffic density, the level of signal coordination, and turning-control design. These findings provide practical insights for improving the safety and robustness of MARL-based mixed traffic control systems, supporting the development of intelligent transportation systems in which both efficiency and safety are jointly optimized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u63a7\u5236\uff08MTC\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f66\u8f86\u603b\u6570\u3001\u6709\u65e0\u4fe1\u53f7\u706f\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u914d\u7f6e\u53ca\u8f6c\u5411\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4eba\u9a7e\u8f66\u8f86\uff08HVs\uff09\u4e0e\u65e0\u4eba\u8f66\uff08RVs\uff09\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709MARL\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u2014\u2014\u603b\u8f66\u6d41\u91cf\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u5316/\u975e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5316\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f6c\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u5bf9\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u534f\u8c03\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u8f6c\u5411\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u4e09\u8005\u5747\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347MARL\u9a71\u52a8\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While recent systems have advanced multimodal search through semantic, object, and OCR queries - and can retrieve temporally consecutive scenes - they often rely on a single query modality for an entire sequence, limiting robustness in complex temporal contexts. To overcome this, we propose a cross-modal temporal event retrieval framework that enables different query modalities to describe distinct scenes within a sequence. To determine decision thresholds for scene transition and slide change adaptively, we build Kernel Density Gaussian Mixture Thresholding (KDE-GMM) algorithm, ensuring optimal keyframe selection. These extracted keyframes act as compact, high-quality visual exemplars that retain each segment's semantic essence, improving retrieval precision and efficiency. Additionally, the system incorporates a large language model (LLM) to refine and expand user queries, enhancing overall retrieval performance.

By reformulating the inverse problem as a static equilibrium in the reference configuration, our method attains computational efficiency comparable to forward simulations while preserving high fidelity.

Although many probabilistic planning algorithms exist for this purpose, these algorithms can be inefficient if executed with the robot's limited computational resources, or may require more steps than expected to achieve the goal. We thereby created a new, lightweight, probabilistic planning algorithm, Plan-Orchestrated Tree Assembly for Lookahead (POrTAL), that combines the strengths of two baseline planning algorithms, FF-Replan and POMCP.

These shortcomings pose significant risks in sensitive contexts where users, particularly non-professionals and caregivers, seek medically relevant guidance or emotional reassurance. To address these challenges, we introduce a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based alignment framework designed to improve factual correctness, semantic coherence, and human-centric qualities such as empathy, politeness, and simplicity in caregiver-patient dialogues. Our approach fine-tunes domain-adapted LLMs using pairwise preference data, where preferred responses reflect supportive and accessible communication styles while rejected ones represent prescriptive or overly technical tones. This direct optimization method aligns model outputs with human preferences more efficiently than traditional reinforcement-learning-based alignment. Empirical evaluations across multiple open and proprietary LLMs show that our DPO-tuned models achieve higher semantic alignment, improved factual accuracy, and stronger human-centric evaluation scores compared to baseline and commercial alternatives such as Google medical dialogue systems. These improvements demonstrate that preference-based alignment offers a scalable and transparent pathway toward developing trustworthy, empathetic, and clinically informed AI assistants for caregiver and healthcare communication.

Pilot study. Data, prompts, and code available at https://osf.io/dc24t/", "summary": "Large language models are increasingly used to evaluate other models, yet these judgments typically lack any representation of confidence. This pilot study tests whether framing an evaluation task as a betting game (a fictional prediction market with its own LLM currency) improves forecasting accuracy and surfaces calibrated confidence signals. We generated 100 math and logic questions with verifiable answers. Six Baseline models (three current-generation, three prior-generation) answered all items. Three Predictor models then forecasted, for each question-baseline pair, if the baseline would answer correctly. Each predictor completed matched runs in two conditions: Control (simple correct/incorrect predictions) and Incentive (predictions plus wagers of 1-100,000 LLMCoin under even odds, starting from a 1,000,000 LLMCoin bankroll). Across 5,400 predictions per condition, Incentive runs showed modestly higher accuracy (81.5% vs. 79.1%, p = .089, d = 0.86) and significantly faster learning across rounds (12.0 vs. 2.9 percentage-point improvement from Round 1 to Round 4, p = .011). Most notably, stake size tracked confidence. \"Whale\" bets of 40,000+ coins were correct ~99% of the time, while small bets (<1,000 coins) showed only ~74% accuracy. The key finding is not that fictional money makes models smarter; accuracy gains were modest and did not reach statistical significance (p = .089) in this pilot.

Accordingly, this study aims to characterize the interactions between the lane-changing vehicle (active vehicle) and the vehicle directly impacted by the maneuver in the target lane (passive vehicle). Utilizing real-world trajectory data from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), this study explores patterns in lane-changing behavior and provides insight into how these behaviors evolve under different AV market penetration rates (MPRs). In particular, we propose a game-theoretic framework to analyze cooperative and defective behaviors in mixed traffic, applied to the 7,636 observed lane-changing events in the WOMD. First, we utilize k-means clustering to classify vehicles as cooperative or defective, revealing that the proportions of cooperative AVs are higher than those of HDVs in both active and passive roles. Next, we jointly estimate the utilities of active and passive vehicles to model their behaviors using the quantal response equilibrium framework. Empirical payoff tables are then constructed based on these utilities. Using these payoffs, we analyze the presence of social dilemmas and examine the evolution of cooperative behaviors using evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal the presence of social dilemmas in approximately 4% and 11% of lane-changing events for active and passive vehicles, respectively, with most classified as Stag Hunt or Prisoner's Dilemma (Chicken Game rarely observed). Moreover, the Monte Carlo simulation results show that repeated lane-changing interactions consistently lead to increased cooperative behavior over time, regardless of the AV penetration rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528Waymo\u5f00\u653e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08WOMD\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08HDVs\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AVs\uff09\u5728\u53d8\u9053\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4e0e\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u5747\u8861\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0AV\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u91cd\u590d\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f1a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f4eAV\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u4e0b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AVs\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08HDVs\uff09\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u53d8\u9053\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eWOMD\u6570\u636e\uff087636\u4e2a\u53d8\u9053\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528k-means\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u5408\u4f5c/\u7f3a\u9677\u578b\u8f66\u8f86\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u5747\u8861\uff08QRE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3b/\u88ab\u52a8\u8f66\u8f86\u6548\u7528\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6536\u76ca\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u5408\u4f5c\u6f14\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b\u8f85\u4ee5\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "result": "AV\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u89d2\u8272\u4e2d\u5408\u4f5c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8eHDV\uff1b\u7ea64%\uff08\u4e3b\u52a8\uff09\u548c11%\uff08\u88ab\u52a8\uff09\u53d8\u9053\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3aStag Hunt\u6216Prisoner's Dilemma\uff1b\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u91cd\u590d\u4ea4\u4e92\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u4f5c\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0d\u53d7AV\u5e02\u573a\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "AV\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u53d8\u9053\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u6027\uff1b\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\u81ea\u53d1\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e3aAV\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Many retrieval methods typically integrate additional cross-scenario samples to enhance the overall performance ceiling. However, those model designs neglect the fact that a part of the cross-scenario samples have already been retrieved by existing models within a system, leading to diminishing marginal utility in delivering incremental performance gains. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval framework IncRec, specifically for cross-scenario incremental sample learning. The innovations of IncRec can be highlighted as two aspects. Firstly, we construct extreme cross-scenario incremental samples that are not retrieved by any existing model. And we design an incremental sample learning framework which focuses on capturing incremental representation to improve the overall retrieval performance.

This conflates policy performance with motion difficulty, obscuring whether failures stem from poor learning or inherently challenging motions. In this work, we address this gap with Motion Difficulty Score (MDS), a novel metric that defines and quantifies imitation difficulty independent of policy performance. Grounded in rigid-body dynamics, MDS interprets difficulty as the torque variation induced by small pose perturbations: larger torque-to-pose variation yields flatter reward landscapes and thus higher learning difficulty. MDS captures this through three properties of the perturbation-induced torque space: volume, variance, and temporal variability. We also use it to construct MD-AMASS, a difficulty-aware repartitioning of the AMASS dataset. Empirically, we rigorously validate MDS by demonstrating its explanatory power on the performance of state-of-the-art motion imitation policies. We further demonstrate the utility of MDS through two new MDS-based metrics: Maximum Imitable Difficulty (MID) and Difficulty-Stratified Joint Error (DSJE), providing fresh insights into imitation learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff08MDS\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u4eff\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u521a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5c0f\u59ff\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u626d\u77e9\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f53\u79ef\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6MD-AMASS\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807MID\u548cDSJE\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MDS\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u4eff\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5173\u8282\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u672c\u8eab\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u8fd8\u662f\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fa\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u521a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u96be\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5c0f\u59ff\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u6240\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u626d\u77e9\u53d8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u8bf1\u5bfc\u626d\u77e9\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684AMASS\u5b50\u96c6MD-AMASS\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faMID\u4e0eDSJE\u4e24\u4e2a\u884d\u751f\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "MDS\u88ab\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u79cdSOTA\u6a21\u4eff\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff1bMD-AMASS\u548cMID\u3001DSJE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "MDS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u96be\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u4eff\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

We present two novel tokenization schemes that separate words in a nonlinear manner, preserving information about tonal morphology as much as possible. One of these approaches, a Segment and Melody tokenizer, simply extracts the tones without predicting segmentation. The other, a Sequence of Processes tokenizer, predicts segmentation for the words, which could allow an end-to-end ASR system to produce segmented and unsegmented transcriptions in a single pass. We find that these novel tokenizers are competitive with BPE and Unigram models, and the Segment-and-Melody model outperforms traditional tokenizers in terms of word error rate but does not reach the same character error rate. In addition, we analyze tokenizers on morphological and information-theoretic metrics to find predictive correlations with downstream performance. Our results suggest that nonlinear tokenizers designed specifically for the non-concatenative morphology of a language are competitive with conventional BPE and Unigram models for ASR.

Unlike traditional dataset pruning and distillation methods that focus on inter-sample redundancy, the proposed method compresses each image by reducing redundant or less informative content within samples while preserving essential features. It first applies linear symmetric quantization to obtain an initial quantization range and scale for each sample. Then, an adaptive quantization allocation algorithm is introduced to distribute different quantization ratios for samples with varying precision requirements, maintaining a constant total compression ratio. The main contributions include: (1) being the first to use limited bits to represent datasets for storage reduction; (2) introducing a dataset-level quantization algorithm with adaptive ratio allocation; and (3) validating the method's effectiveness through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K.

Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in automating ASD diagnosis, but most existing models operate as black boxes and are typically trained on a single dataset, limiting their generalizability. In this study, we introduce a transparent and interpretable ML approach that leverages BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze unstructured clinical text. The model is trained to label descriptions of behaviors and map them to diagnostic criteria, which are then used to assign a final label (ASD or not). We evaluate transfer learning, the ability to transfer knowledge to new data, using two distinct real-world datasets. We trained on datasets sequentially and mixed together and compared the performance of the best models and their ability to transfer to new data. We also created a black-box approach and repeated this transfer process for comparison. Our transparent model demonstrated robust performance, with the mixed-data training strategy yielding the best results (97 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity). Sequential training across datasets led to a slight drop in performance, highlighting the importance of training data order. The black-box model performed worse (90 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) when trained sequentially or with mixed data. Overall, our transparent approach outperformed the black-box approach. Mixing datasets during training resulted in slightly better performance and should be the preferred approach when practically possible.

In this theoretical work, we propose \\textbf{Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI)}, a formal framework rooted in algebraic topology that unifies learning and memory as phase transitions of a single geometric substrate. Central to our theory is the \\textbf{Homological Parity Principle}, which posits a fundamental dichotomy: even-dimensional homology ($H_{even}$) physically instantiates stable \\textbf{Content} (stable scaffolds or ``what''), while odd-dimensional homology ($H_{odd}$) instantiates dynamic \\textbf{Context} (dynamic flows or ``where''). We derive the logical flow of MAI as a topological trinity transformation: \\textbf{Search $\\to$ Closure $\\to$ Structure}. Specifically, we demonstrate that cognition operates by converting high-complexity recursive search (modeled by \\textit{Savitch's Theorem} in NPSPACE) into low-complexity lookup (modeled by \\textit{Dynamic Programming} in P) via the mechanism of \\textbf{Topological Cycle Closure}. We further show that this consolidation process is governed by a topological generalization of the Wake-Sleep algorithm, functioning as a coordinate descent that alternates between optimizing the $H_{odd}$ flow (inference/wake) and condensing persistent cycles into the $H_{even}$ scaffold (learning/sleep). This framework offers a rigorous explanation for the emergence of fast-thinking (intuition) from slow-thinking (reasoning) and provides a blueprint for post-Turing architectures that compute via topological resonance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMemory-Amortized Inference\uff08MAI\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u6570\u62d3\u6251\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u8c03\u5947\u5076\u6027\u539f\u7406\u533a\u5206\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5076\u7ef4\u540c\u8c03\uff09\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u5947\u7ef4\u540c\u8c03\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u5faa\u73af\u95ed\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u5230\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u67e5\u8868\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u76f4\u89c9\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5272\u88c2\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u7387\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u77e5\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u3001\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u6570\u62d3\u6251\u6784\u5efaMAI\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u540c\u8c03\u5947\u5076\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff08H_even\u8868\u5f81\u7a33\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9\uff0cH_odd\u8868\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u2018\u641c\u7d22\u2192\u95ed\u5408\u2192\u7ed3\u6784\u2019\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e09\u5143\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u5faa\u73af\u95ed\u5408\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49Wake-Sleep\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0H_odd\uff08\u63a8\u7406/\u5524\u9192\uff09\u4e0eH_even\uff08\u5b66\u4e60/\u7761\u7720\uff09\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aNPSPACE\u5230P\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08Savitch\u5b9a\u7406\u2192\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5feb\u601d\u8003\uff08\u76f4\u89c9\uff09\u6e90\u4e8e\u6162\u601d\u8003\uff08\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u7ecf\u62d3\u6251\u95ed\u5408\u540e\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u5171\u632f\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u56fe\u7075\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u5171\u632f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u84dd\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "MAI\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55-\u62d3\u6251\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e5f\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u52a8\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u53d8\u800c\u975e\u5206\u79bb\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u3002"}}

Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86FAIRGAME\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6fc0\u52b1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u516c\u5171\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u793e\u4f1a\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u6fc0\u52b1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u503e\u5411\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u7ec8\u5c40\u80cc\u53db\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u65e5\u76ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u6218\u7565\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9AI\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6df1\u8fdc\u610f\u4e49\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u80cc\u540e\u610f\u56fe\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55FAIRGAME\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u7c7b\u65b0\u535a\u5f08\u73af\u5883\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u6536\u76ca\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9694\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6fc0\u52b1\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u76ca\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u516c\u5171\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u91cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u89e3\u6790LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5448\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u6fc0\u52b1\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u5316\u3001\u7ec8\u5c40\u8d8b\u5411\u80cc\u53db\uff1b\u4e14\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe\u53ef\u88ab\u7ecf\u5178\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8ff0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u65f6\u582a\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5ba1\u8ba1LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5408\u4f5c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bf9AI\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u6307\u5bfc\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The abundance of data in various modalities in this field has led to a growing importance of cross-modal retrieval for efficient image interpretation, data-driven diagnostic support, and medical education. In the context of the increasing integration of distributed medical data across healthcare facilities with the objective of enhancing interoperability, it is imperative to optimize the performance of retrieval systems in terms of the speed, memory efficiency, and accuracy of the retrieved data. This necessity arises in response to the substantial surge in data volume that characterizes contemporary medical practices. In this study, we propose a novel framework that incorporates dropout voting and mixture-of-experts (MoE) based contrastive fusion modules into a CLIP-based cross-modal hashing retrieval structure. We also propose the application of hybrid loss. So we now call our model MCMFH which is a medical cross-modal fusion hashing retrieval.

To address these challenges, we propose two novel designs. First, we propose a compact distribution-based latent representation that enables efficient and high-quality geometry generation. We improve upon previous work by establishing a more uniform mapping between SMPL and avatar geometries. Second, we introduce a generative animation model that fully exploits the diversity of limited motion data. We focus on short-term transitions while maintaining long-term consistency through an identity-conditioned design. These two designs formulate our method as a two-stage framework: the first stage learns a latent space, while the second learns to generate animations within this latent space. We conducted experiments on both our latent space and animation model. We demonstrate that our latent space produces high-fidelity human geometry surpassing previous methods ($90\\%$ lower Chamfer Dist.).

Although these SDLs have automated many of the steps required to conduct chemical and materials experiments, a commonly overlooked step in the automation pipeline is the handling and reloading of substrates used to transfer or deposit materials onto for downstream characterization. Here, we develop a closed-loop method of Automated Substrate Handling and Exchange (ASHE) using robotics, dual-actuated dispensers, and deep learning-driven computer vision to detect and correct errors in the manipulation of fragile and transparent substrates for SDLs. Using ASHE, we demonstrate a 98.5% first-time placement accuracy across 130 independent trials of reloading transparent glass substrates into an SDL, where only two substrate misplacements occurred and were successfully detected as errors and automatically corrected. Through the development of more accurate and reliable methods for handling various types of substrates, we move toward an improvement in the automation capabilities of self-driving laboratories, furthering the acceleration of novel chemical and materials discoveries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aASHE\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u677f\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u66f4\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u53cc\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u5668\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8106\u5f31\u900f\u660e\u57fa\u677f\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u653e\u7f6e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff08SDL\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff08SDL\uff09\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u5b9e\u9a8c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u677f\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u8f6c\u79fb\u6216\u6c89\u79ef\u7684\u8f7d\u4f53\uff09\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u91cd\u88c5\u4ecd\u662f\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u900f\u660e\u57fa\u677f\uff0c\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u4e14\u96be\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAutomated Substrate Handling and Exchange (ASHE) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u53cc\u81f4\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u5668\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u677f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u653e\u7f6e\u53ca\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728130\u6b21\u72ec\u7acb\u900f\u660e\u73bb\u7483\u57fa\u677f\u91cd\u88c5\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u653e\u7f6e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe98.5%\uff0c\u4ec5\u53d1\u751f2\u6b21\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e14\u5747\u88ab\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002", "conclusion": "ASHE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SDL\u4e2d\u57fa\u677f\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u94fe\u6761\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u65b0\u6750\u6599\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce VG3T, a novel multi-view feed-forward network that predicts a 3D semantic occupancy via a 3D Gaussian representation. Unlike prior methods that infer Gaussians from single-view images, our model directly predicts a set of semantically attributed Gaussians in a joint, multi-view fashion. This novel approach overcomes the fragmentation and inconsistency inherent in view-by-view processing, offering a unified paradigm to represent both geometry and semantics. We also introduce two key components, Grid-Based Sampling and Positional Refinement, to mitigate the distance-dependent density bias common in pixel-aligned Gaussian initialization methods.

Effective alignment in such settings requires reward models that are interpretable so that stakeholders can understand and audit model objectives. Moreover, reward models must be capable of steering agents at interaction time, allowing preference shifts to be incorporated without retraining. We introduce ARCANE, a framework that frames alignment as a multi-agent collaboration problem that dynamically represents stakeholder preferences as natural-language rubrics: weighted sets of verifiable criteria that can be generated on-the-fly from task context. Inspired by utility theory, we formulate rubric learning as a reconstruction problem and apply a regularized Group-Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) procedure that balances interpretability, faithfulness, and computational efficiency. Using a corpus of 219 labeled rubrics derived from the GDPVal benchmark, we evaluate ARCANE on challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use. The learned rubrics produce compact, legible evaluations and enable configurable trade-offs (e.g., correctness vs. conciseness) without retraining.

They pose significant risks to human health, making their accurate detection the crux of efforts to monitor and minimize exposure. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy enables the ultrasensitive detection at low-concentrations of VOCs in the atmosphere by measuring their IR absorption spectra. However, the complexity of the IR spectra limits the possibility to implement VOC recognition and quantification in real-time. While deep neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used for the recognition of complex data structures, they typically require massive datasets for the training phase. Here, we create an experimental VOC dataset for nine different classes of compounds at various concentrations, using their IR absorption spectra. To further increase the amount of spectra and their diversity in term of VOC concentration, we augment the experimental dataset with synthetic spectra created via conditional generative NNs.

Practitioners frequently tend to study or compare MARL algorithms from a qualitative perspective largely due to the inherent stochasticity in practical algorithms arising from random dithering exploration strategies, environment transition noise, and stochastic gradient updates to name a few. Traditional analytical approaches, such as replicator dynamics, often rely on mean-field approximations to remove stochastic effects, but this simplification, whilst able to provide general overall trends, might lead to dissonance between analytical predictions and actual realisations of individual trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on MARL systems by modelling them as \\textit{coupled stochastic dynamical systems}, capturing both agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyse the stability and sensitivity of agent behaviour at individual level, which are key dimensions for their practical deployments, for example, in presence of strict safety requirements. This framework allows us, for the first time, to rigorously study MARL dynamics taking into consideration their inherent stochasticity, providing a deeper understanding of system behaviour and practical insights for the design and control of multi-agent learning processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u56fa\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u5747\u573a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MARL\u5206\u6790\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5747\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u4e2a\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06MARL\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e2a\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u7559\u7b97\u6cd5\u56fa\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u63a2\u7d22\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u73af\u5883\u8f6c\u79fb\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff09\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9MARL\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u523b\u3001\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

The evolution of RSs is paramount in the digital era, in which personalised user experience is tailored to the user's preferences.

Despite their potential, generative RS methods face issues such as hallucination, which degrades the recommendation performance, and high computational cost in practical scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce HGLMRec, a novel Multi-LLM agent-based RS that incorporates a hypergraph encoder designed to capture complex, multi-behaviour relationships between users and items.

We present a complete pipeline for constructing multi-rigid-body approximations of human hands that preserve realistic appearance while enabling real-time physics simulation. Starting from optical motion capture of a specific human hand, we construct a personalized MANO (Multi-Abstracted hand model with Neural Operations) model and convert it to a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) representation with anatomically consistent joint axes. The key technical challenge is projecting MANO's unconstrained SO(3) joint rotations onto the kinematically constrained joints of the rigid-body model. We derive closed-form solutions for single degree-of-freedom joints and introduce a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)-corrected iterative method for two degree-of-freedom joints that properly handles the non-commutativity of rotations.

In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving.

Our key idea is a novel Emotion-aware Gaussian Diffusion, which includes an action unit (AU) prompt Gaussian diffusion process for fine-grained facial animator, and moreover an accurate text-to-AU emotion controller to provide accurate and expansive dynamic emotional editing using text input. Experiments on public EmoTalk3D and RenderMe-360 datasets demonstrate superior emotional subtlety, lip-sync fidelity, and controllability of our EmoDiffTalk over previous works, establishing a principled pathway toward high-quality, diffusion-driven, multimodal editable 3D talking-head synthesis. To our best knowledge, our EmoDiffTalk is one of the first few 3D Gaussian Splatting talking-head generation framework, especially supporting continuous, multimodal emotional editing within the AU-based expression space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEmoDiffTalk\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u7eea\u611f\u77e5\u9ad8\u65af\u6269\u6563\u7684\u53ef\u7f16\u8f913D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u6587\u672c+\u52a8\u4f5c\u5355\u5143\uff09\u60c5\u7eea\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3001\u53e3\u578b\u540c\u6b65\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u5199\u5b9e3D\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u8868\u8fbe\u64cd\u63a7\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u60c5\u7eea\u611f\u77e5\u9ad8\u65af\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5355\u5143\uff08AU\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230AU\u60c5\u7eea\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u60c5\u7eea\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5728EmoTalk3D\u548cRenderMe-360\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86EmoDiffTalk\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u7ec6\u817b\u5ea6\u3001\u5507\u97f3\u540c\u6b65\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EmoDiffTalk\u662f\u9996\u6279\u652f\u6301AU\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u7eea\u7f16\u8f91\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6846\u67b6\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u76843D\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition.

However, we demonstrate that such synthetic releases can still leak information about the underlying training samples through structural overlap in the data manifold. We propose a black-box membership inference attack that exploits this vulnerability without requiring access to model internals or real data. The attacker repeatedly queries the generative model to obtain large numbers of synthetic samples, performs unsupervised clustering to identify dense regions of the synthetic distribution, and then analyzes cluster medoids and neighborhoods that correspond to high-density regions in the original training data. These neighborhoods act as proxies for training samples, enabling the adversary to infer membership or reconstruct approximate records. Our experiments across healthcare, finance, and other sensitive domains show that cluster overlap between real and synthetic data leads to measurable membership leakage-even when the generator is trained with differential privacy or other noise mechanisms. The results highlight an under-explored attack surface in synthetic data generation pipelines and call for stronger privacy guarantees that account for distributional neighborhood inference rather than sample-level memorization alone, underscoring its role in privacy-preserving data publishing.

Existing solutions for extracting relevant content are inadequate: generative extraction models suffer from high latency, rule-based heuristics lack adaptability, and chunk-and-rerank methods are blind to webpage structure. To overcome these issues, we introduce Index-based Web Content Extraction to reframe the extraction process from slow, token-by-token generation into a highly efficient, discriminative task of index prediction, achieving both effectiveness and efficiency. We partition HTML into structure-aware, addressable segments, and extract only the positional indices of content relevant to a given query. This method decouples extraction latency from content length, enabling rapid, query-relevant extraction.

This requires inferring nearly $90^\\circ$ viewpoint gaps from image sources with severely foreshortened facades and flawed textures, causing state-of-the-art reconstruction engines such as NeRF and 3DGS to fail.\n  To address this problem, we propose two design choices tailored for city structures and satellite inputs. First, we model city geometry as a 2.5D height map, implemented as a Z-monotonic signed distance field (SDF) that matches urban building layouts from top-down viewpoints. This stabilizes geometry optimization under sparse, off-nadir satellite views and yields a watertight mesh with crisp roofs and clean, vertically extruded facades. Second, we paint the mesh appearance from satellite images via differentiable rendering techniques. While the satellite inputs may contain long-range, blurry captures, we further train a generative texture restoration network to enhance the appearance, recovering high-frequency, plausible texture details from degraded inputs.\n  Our method's scalability and robustness are demonstrated through extensive experiments on large-scale urban reconstruction. For example, in our teaser figure, we reconstruct a $4\\,\\mathrm{km}^2$ real-world region from only a few satellite images, achieving state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing photorealistic ground views. The resulting models are not only visually compelling but also serve as high-fidelity, application-ready assets for downstream tasks like urban planning and simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u7ea73D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72.5D\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u7ed3\u5408\u7eb9\u7406\u4fee\u590d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5927\u89c6\u89d2\u5916\u63a8\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57ce\u533a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u7ea7\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u9762\u4e34\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\u5916\u63a8\u6311\u6218\uff08\u8fd190\u5ea6\u89c6\u89d2\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u548c3DGS\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5efa\u7b51\u7acb\u9762\u4e25\u91cd\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u5931\u771f\u800c\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u91c7\u7528Z\u5355\u8c03\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\uff08SDF\uff09\u5efa\u6a212.5D\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u57ce\u5e02\u5efa\u7b51\u9876\u90e8\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7a00\u758f\u659c\u89c6\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u5c06\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u7f51\u683c\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7eb9\u7406\u4fee\u590d\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4f4e\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u57284 km\u00b2\u771f\u5b9e\u57ce\u533a\u4e0a\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u903c\u771f\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u5b8c\u6574\uff08\u6c34\u5bc6\u7f51\u683c\uff09\u3001\u5c4b\u9876\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u7acb\u9762\u5782\u76f4\u62c9\u4f38\u76843D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5730\u9762\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u51e0\u4f55\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4ea7\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We first derive an analytic solution for the deterministic curve-straight basic engagement zone (CSBEZ), then extend this formulation to a probabilistic framework using four uncertainty-propagation approaches: Monte Carlo sampling, linearization, quadratic approximation, and neural-network regression. We evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of each approximation method and demonstrate how CSPEZ constraints can be integrated into a trajectory-optimization algorithm to produce safe paths that explicitly account for pursuer uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u66f2\u7ebf-\u76f4\u7ebf\u6982\u7387\u4ea4\u6218\u533a\uff08CSPEZ\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u89c4\u907f\u6355\u83b7\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efaCSPEZ\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u8f6c\u5411\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8ffd\u51fb\u8005\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u822a\u5411\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u6700\u5927\u8f6c\u5411\u7387\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u5bf9\u9003\u9038\u8005\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u523b\u753b\u6355\u83b7\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u66f2\u7ebf-\u76f4\u7ebf\u57fa\u672c\u4ea4\u6218\u533a\uff08CSBEZ\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u3001\u4e8c\u6b21\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u56de\u5f52\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff08CSPEZ\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5c06CSPEZ\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e0a\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CSPEZ\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u663e\u5f0f\u89c4\u907f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u8ffd\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9003\u9038\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "CSPEZ\u4e3a\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u907f\u78b0\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Different applications require distinct simplification policies, such as replacing only complex words at the lexical level or rewriting the entire sentence while trading off details for simplicity. However, achieving such policy-driven control remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful approach that leverages Large Language Model-as-a-Judge (LLM-as-a-Judge) to automatically construct policy-aligned training data, completely removing the need for costly human annotation or parallel corpora. Our method enables building simplification systems that adapt to diverse simplification policies. Remarkably, even small-scale open-source LLMs such as Phi-3-mini-3.8B surpass GPT-4o on lexical-oriented simplification, while achieving comparable performance on overall rewriting, as verified by both automatic metrics and human evaluations.

However, existing models are predominantly trained on surgical pathology data, which is enriched for non-nervous tissue and overrepresents neoplastic, inflammatory, metabolic, and other non-neurological diseases. Neuropathology represents a markedly different domain of histopathology, characterized by unique cell types (neurons, glia, etc.), distinct cytoarchitecture, and disease-specific pathological features including neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies, and pattern-specific neurodegeneration. This domain mismatch may limit the ability of general-purpose foundation models to capture the morphological patterns critical for interpreting neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebellar ataxias. To address this gap, we developed NeuroFM, a foundation model trained specifically on whole-slide images of brain tissue spanning diverse neurodegenerative pathologies. NeuroFM demonstrates superior performance compared to general-purpose models across multiple neuropathology-specific downstream tasks, including mixed dementia disease classification, hippocampal region segmentation, and neurodegenerative ataxia identification encompassing cerebellar essential tremor and spinocerebellar ataxia subtypes. This work establishes that domain-specialized foundation models trained on brain tissue can better capture neuropathology-specific features than models trained on general surgical pathology datasets. By tailoring foundation models to the unique morphological landscape of neurodegenerative diseases, NeuroFM enables more accurate and reliable AI-based analysis for brain disease diagnosis and research, setting a precedent for domain-specific model development in specialized areas of digital pathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578bNeuroFM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8111\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u5982\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u3001\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u79d1\u75c5\u7406\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7279\u6709\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7f20\u7ed3\u3001\u6dc0\u7c89\u6837\u6591\u5757\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7684Foundation Model\u2014\u2014NeuroFM\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u8111\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u75f4\u5446\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6d77\u9a6c\u533a\u5206\u5272\u3001\u5171\u6d4e\u5931\u8c03\u4e9a\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "NeuroFM\u5728\u591a\u9879\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\uff09\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347AI\u5728\u8111\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8303\u4f8b\u3002"}}

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising path towards improving outcomes in such uncertain decision-making scenarios and moving beyond reactive strategies. However, training RL agents requires many environment interactions, and the speed of existing wildfire simulators is a severely limiting factor. We introduce $\\texttt{JaxWildfire}$, a simulator underpinned by a principled probabilistic fire spread model based on cellular automata. It is implemented in JAX and enables vectorized simulations using $\\texttt{vmap}$, allowing high throughput of simulations on GPUs.

One simple method for doing so is to include statements describing beliefs maintained in the prompt space (in what we'll call their belief boxes). But when agents have such statements in belief boxes, how does it actually affect their behaviors and dispositions towards those beliefs? And does it significantly affect agents' ability to be persuasive in multi-agent scenarios? Likewise, if the agents are given instructions to be open-minded, how does that affect their behaviors? We explore these and related questions in a series of experiments. Our findings confirm that instructing agents to be open-minded affects how amenable they are to belief change. We show that incorporating belief statements and their strengths influences an agent's resistance to (and persuasiveness against) opposing viewpoints. Furthermore, it affects the likelihood of belief change, particularly when the agent is outnumbered in a debate by opposing viewpoints, i.e., peer pressure scenarios.

Unlike the stable playback time of traditional TV live or the fixed content of short video, live-streaming, due to the dynamics of content and time, poses higher requirements for the recommendation algorithm of the platform - understanding the ever-changing content in real time and push it to users at the appropriate moment. Through analysis, we find that users have a better experience and express more positive behaviors during highlight moments of the live-streaming. Furthermore, since the model lacks access to future content during recommendation, yet user engagement depends on how well subsequent content aligns with their interests, an intuitive solution is to predict future live-streaming content. Therefore, we perform semantic quantization on live-streaming segments to obtain Semantic ids (Sid), encode the historical Sid sequence to capture the author's characteristics, and model Sid evolution trend to enable foresight prediction of future content. This foresight enhances the ranking model through refined features. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49ID\uff08Sid\uff09\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u76f4\u64ad\u5185\u5bb9\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u5386\u53f2Sid\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u8d8b\u52bf\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u76f4\u64ad\u672a\u6765\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u2018\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u2019\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u64ad\u5185\u5bb9\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u540e\u7eed\u5185\u5bb9\u8d70\u5411\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u672a\u6765\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9ad8\u5149\u65f6\u523b\u53ca\u65f6\u63a8\u9001\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u76f4\u64ad\u7247\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u91cf\u5316\u751f\u6210Semantic ID\uff08Sid\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efaSid\u65f6\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5982RNN/Transformer\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u8005\u5185\u5bb9\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765Sid\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u3001\u89c2\u770b\u65f6\u957f\u3001\u4e92\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u5149\u65f6\u523b\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49ID\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u76f4\u64ad\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u2018\u4fe1\u606f\u6ede\u540e\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5185\u5bb9\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Project webpage: https://tau-vailab.github.io/Lang3D-XL", "summary": "Embedding a language field in a 3D representation enables richer semantic understanding of spatial environments by linking geometry with descriptive meaning. This allows for a more intuitive human-computer interaction, enabling querying or editing scenes using natural language, and could potentially improve tasks like scene retrieval, navigation, and multimodal reasoning. While such capabilities could be transformative, in particular for large-scale scenes, we find that recent feature distillation approaches cannot effectively learn over massive Internet data due to challenges in semantic feature misalignment and inefficiency in memory and runtime. To this end, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges. First, we introduce extremely low-dimensional semantic bottleneck features as part of the underlying 3D Gaussian representation.

To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive human study involving interviews with 26 guide dog handlers, four white cane users, nine guide dog trainers, and one O\\&M trainer, along with 15+ hours of observing guide dog-assisted walking. After de-identification, we open-sourced the dataset to promote human-centered development and informed decision-making for assistive systems for BLV people. Building on insights from this formative study, we developed GuideNav, a vision-only, teach-and-repeat navigation system. Inspired by how guide dogs are trained and assist their handlers, GuideNav autonomously repeats a path demonstrated by a sighted person using a robot. Specifically, the system constructs a topological representation of the taught route, integrates visual place recognition with temporal filtering, and employs a relative pose estimator to compute navigation actions - all without relying on costly, heavy, power-hungry sensors such as LiDAR. In field tests, GuideNav consistently achieved kilometer-scale route following across five outdoor environments, maintaining reliability despite noticeable scene variations between teach and repeat runs. A user study with 3 guide dog handlers and 1 guide dog trainer further confirmed the system's feasibility, marking (to our knowledge) the first demonstration of a quadruped mobile system retrieving a path in a manner comparable to guide dogs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGuideNav\u7684\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u6559-\u91cd\u590d\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u76f2\u4eba\u53ca\u4f4e\u89c6\u529b\u4eba\u58eb\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d7\u5bfc\u76f2\u72ac\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u5f0f\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700LiDAR\u7b49\u6602\u8d35\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6237\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u91cc\u7ea7\u53ef\u9760\u8def\u5f84\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9762\u5411\u76f2\u4eba\u53ca\u4f4e\u89c6\u529b\uff08BLV\uff09\u7528\u6237\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5341\u5206\u532e\u4e4f\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u57fa\u4e8eBLV\u771f\u5b9e\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e60\u60ef\u7684\u4eba\u672c\u5316\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6491\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u6db5\u76d626\u540d\u5bfc\u76f2\u72ac\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u30014\u540d\u767d\u624b\u6756\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u30019\u540d\u5bfc\u76f2\u72ac\u8bad\u5bfc\u5e08\u53ca1\u540d\u5b9a\u5411\u884c\u8d70\uff08O&M\uff09\u8bad\u5bfc\u5e08\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5e76\u7d2f\u8ba1\u89c2\u5bdf15+\u5c0f\u65f6\u5bfc\u76f2\u72ac\u8f85\u52a9\u884c\u8d70\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u7684GuideNav\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u6559\u5b66\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5bfc\u822a\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "GuideNav\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6237\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u91cc\u7ea7\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6559\u5b66\u4e0e\u590d\u73b0\u9636\u6bb5\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u660e\u663e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff083\u540d\u5bfc\u76f2\u72ac\u4f7f\u7528\u8005+1\u540d\u8bad\u5bfc\u5e08\uff09\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u53ef\u6bd4\u62df\u5bfc\u76f2\u72ac\u7684\u56db\u8db3\u79fb\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u5bfc\u76f2\u72ac\u8f85\u52a9\u8303\u5f0f\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u5907\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aBLV\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u8f85\u52a9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u4e0e\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We introduce FishDetector-R1, a unified MLLM-based framework for fish detection, segmentation, and counting under weak supervision. On the DeepFish dataset, our framework achieves substantial gains over baselines, improving AP by 20% and mIoU by 10%, while reducing MAE by 30% and GAME by 35%. These improvements stem from two key components: a novel detect-to-count prompt that enforces spatially consistent detections and counts, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) with a complementary scalable paradigm leveraging sparse point labels. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of this reward design. Moreover, the improvement generalizes well to other underwater datasets, confirming strong cross-domain robustness.

While a number of KGC models have been studied, the evaluation of KGC still remain underexplored. In this paper, we observe that existing metrics overlook two key perspectives for KGC evaluation: (A1) predictive sharpness -- the degree of strictness in evaluating an individual prediction, and (A2) popularity-bias robustness -- the ability to predict low-popularity entities. Toward reflecting both perspectives, we propose a novel evaluation framework (PROBE), which consists of a rank transformer (RT) estimating the score of each prediction based on a required level of predictive sharpness and a rank aggregator (RA) aggregating all the scores in a popularity-aware manner. Experiments on real-world KGs reveal that existing metrics tend to over- or under-estimate the accuracy of KGC models, whereas PROBE yields a comprehensive understanding of KGC models and reliable evaluation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8865\u5168\uff08KGC\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6PROBE\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5ffd\u89c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e25\u683c\u6027\uff08predictive sharpness\uff09\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08popularity-bias robustness\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002PROBE\u5305\u542b\u79e9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08RT\uff09\u548c\u79e9\u805a\u5408\u5668\uff08RA\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30KGC\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KGC\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\uff1a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e25\u683c\u6027\uff08A1\uff09\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08A2\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPROBE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u79e9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08RT\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u6839\u636e\u6240\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5355\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79e9\u805a\u5408\u5668\uff08RA\uff09\u4ee5\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u6240\u6709\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u6613\u9ad8\u4f30\u6216\u4f4e\u4f30KGC\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800cPROBE\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "PROBE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684KGC\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540cKGC\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To counter this, we introduce CompressARC, a 76K parameter model without any pretraining that solves 20% of evaluation puzzles by minimizing the description length (MDL) of the target puzzle purely during inference time. The MDL endows CompressARC with extreme generalization abilities typically unheard of in deep learning. To our knowledge, CompressARC is the only deep learning method for ARC-AGI where training happens only on a single sample: the target inference puzzle itself, with the final solution information removed. Moreover, CompressARC does not train on the pre-provided ARC-AGI \"training set\". Under these extremely data-limited conditions, we do not ordinarily expect any puzzles to be solvable at all.

The setup begins with a short seed sentence. After that, each model reads the other's output and generates a response. This continues for a fixed number of steps. We used Mistral Nemo Base 2407 and Llama 2 13B hf. We observed that most conversations start coherently but later fall into repetition. In many runs, a short phrase appears and repeats across turns. Once repetition begins, both models tend to produce similar output rather than introducing a new direction in the conversation. This leads to a loop where the same or similar text is produced repeatedly. We describe this behavior as a form of convergence. It occurs even though the models are large, trained separately, and not given any prompt instructions. To study this behavior, we apply lexical and embedding-based metrics to measure how far the conversation drifts from the initial seed and how similar the outputs of the two models becomes as the conversation progresses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u76f8\u4e92\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bdd\u521d\u671f\u8fde\u8d2f\u4f46\u540e\u671f\u9677\u5165\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6536\u655b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u4ec5\u76f8\u4e92\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u8bdd\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u5f02\u5e38\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u957f\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Mistral Nemo Base 2407\u548cLlama 2 13B hf\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u66ff\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4ee5\u77ed\u79cd\u5b50\u53e5\u542f\u52a8\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ea7\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u504f\u79bb\u521d\u59cb\u79cd\u5b50\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u53cc\u65b9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6570\u5bf9\u8bdd\u521d\u671f\u8fde\u8d2f\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u8f6e\u6b21\u589e\u52a0\u666e\u904d\u51fa\u73b0\u91cd\u590d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u67d0\u77ed\u8bed\u6301\u7eed\u590d\u73b0\uff1b\u4e00\u65e6\u5f00\u59cb\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d8b\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6536\u655b\u5faa\u73af\uff1b\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u53d1\u751f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u53d1\u6536\u655b\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5916\u90e8\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5177\u6709\u542f\u793a\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Better robustness to affine transformation and overlapping image detection are some of the benefits associated with CapsNets.

In addition, CapsNets' training and testing are slow and resource hungry. This paper investigates the possibility of Primary Capsules pruning in CapsNets on MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets. We show that a pruned version of CapsNet performs up to 9.90 times faster than the conventional architecture by removing 95 percent of Capsules without a loss of accuracy. Also, our pruned architecture saves on more than 95.36 percent of floating-point operations in the dynamic routing stage of the architecture.

While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for eliciting such post-training reasoning capabilities due to its exceptional performance, it remains plagued by significant training instability and poor sample efficiency. We theoretically identify the root cause of these issues as the lack of distinctiveness within on-policy rollouts: for routine queries, highly homogeneous samples induce destructive gradient conflicts; whereas for hard queries, the scarcity of valid positive samples results in ineffective optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose Distinctiveness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (DaGRPO). DaGRPO incorporates two core mechanisms: (1) Sequence-level Gradient Rectification, which utilizes fine-grained scoring to dynamically mask sample pairs with low distinctiveness, thereby eradicating gradient conflicts at the source; and (2) Off-policy Data Augmentation, which introduces high-quality anchors to recover training signals for challenging tasks. Extensive experiments across 9 mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization benchmarks demonstrate that DaGRPO significantly surpasses existing SFT, GRPO, and hybrid baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art performance (e.g., a +4.7% average accuracy gain on math benchmarks). Furthermore, in-depth analysis confirms that DaGRPO effectively mitigates gradient explosion and accelerates the emergence of long-chain reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5DaGRPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GRPO\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eOOD\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8eon-policy\u91c7\u6837\u7f3a\u4e4f\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff1a\u5e38\u89c4\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u6837\u672c\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u5f15\u53d1\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u56f0\u96be\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDistinctiveness-aware GRPO\uff08DaGRPO\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a(1) \u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u2014\u2014\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6253\u5206\u52a8\u6001\u5c4f\u853d\u4f4e\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b(2) \u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u2014\u2014\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u951a\u70b9\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u56f0\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eOOD\u6cdb\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8aSFT\u3001GRPO\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347+4.7%\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "DaGRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, many U.S. DOTs struggle to obtain accurate AADT, especially for unmonitored roads. While continuous count (CC) stations offer accurate traffic volume data, their implementation is expensive and difficult to deploy widely, compelling agencies to rely on short-duration traffic counts. This study proposes a machine learning framework, the first to our knowledge, to identify optimal representative days for conducting short count (SC) data collection to improve AADT prediction accuracy. Using 2022 and 2023 traffic volume data from the state of Texas, we compare two scenarios: an 'optimal day' approach that iteratively selects the most informative days for AADT estimation and a 'no optimal day' baseline reflecting current practice by most DOTs. To align with Texas DOT's traffic monitoring program, continuous count data were utilized to simulate the 24 hour short counts. The actual field short counts were used to enhance feature engineering through using a leave-one-out (LOO) technique to generate unbiased representative daily traffic features across similar road segments. Our proposed methodology outperforms the baseline across the top five days, with the best day (Day 186) achieving lower errors (RMSE: 7,871.15, MAE: 3,645.09, MAPE: 11.95%) and higher R^2 (0.9756) than the baseline (RMSE: 11,185.00, MAE: 5,118.57, MAPE: 14.42%, R^2: 0.9499).

Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer unified multimodal representation learning, making them a promising backbone. However, applying LVLMs to recommendation remains challenging due to (i) representation misalignment, where domain gaps between item data and general pre-training lead to unaligned embedding spaces, and (ii) gradient conflicts during fine-tuning, where shared adapters cause interference and a lack of discriminative power. To address this, we propose SDA, a lightweight framework for Structural and Disentangled Adaptation, which integrates two components: Cross-Modal Structural Alignment (CMSA) and Modality-Disentangled Adaptation. CMSA aligns embeddings using intra-modal structures as a soft teacher, while MoDA mitigates gradient conflicts via expertized, gated low-rank paths to disentangle gradient flows. Experiments on three public Amazon datasets show SDA integrates seamlessly with existing multimodal and sequential recommenders, yielding average gains of 6.15% in Hit@10 and 8.64% in NDCG@10. It also achieves up to 12.83% and 18.70% gains on long-tail items with minimal inference overhead.

While higher-fidelity models enable more intelligent behavior, they incur increased computational cost. Since strong interactions are relatively infrequent in traffic, a practical strategy for balancing performance and computational overhead is to invoke an appropriate controller based on situational demands. To achieve this approach, we first conduct a comparative study to assess and hierarchize the interactive capabilities of different MPC formulations. Furthermore, we develop a neural network-based classifier to enable situation-aware switching among controllers with different levels of interactive capability. We demonstrate that this situation-aware switching can both substantially improve overall performance by activating the most advanced interactive MPC in rare but critical situations, and significantly reduce computational load by using a basic MPC in the majority of scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684MPC\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5207\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u7684MPC\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u542f\u7528\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fMPC\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e38\u89c4\u573a\u666f\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6MPC\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u884c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u800c\u5f3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u6839\u636e\u60c5\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u591a\u79cdMPC\u516c\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7ea7\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529bMPC\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u4ea4\u4e92MPC\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u6570\u5e38\u89c4\u573a\u666f\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7840MPC\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5207\u6362\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}

Pretrained on 23T high-quality tokens and finetuned on over 30 million diverse instructions, we extend the boundary of the scaling law for small language models. In pre-training, we design a Fine-Grained Warmup-Stable-Decay (FG-WSD) training scheduler, which progressively refines data mixtures across stages to boost model performance. In post-training, to improve the quality of the SFT data, we design a joint mechanism that integrates deliberative generation refinement and chain-of-thought reconstruction, yielding substantial gains on complex tasks. Following SFT, we employ our flagship reasoning model to distill Nanbeige4-3B through our proposed Dual Preference Distillation (DPD) method, which leads to further performance gains. Finally, a multi-stage reinforcement learning phase was applied, leveraging verifiable rewards and preference modeling to strengthen abilities on both reasoning and human alignment.

We introduce a controlled evaluation framework that probes reasoning reliability through four targeted stress tests: (1) rule deletion, removing either redundant or essential rules from a multi-step inference chain; (2) contradictory evidence injection; (3) logic-preserving rewrites generated through several families of equivalence laws (contrapositive, double negation, implication, De Morgan, identity, and commutativity); and (4) multi-law equivalence stacking that introduces 2-5 simultaneous logical transformations.\n  Across three representative model families: BERT, Qwen2, and LLaMA-like models. Our experiments reveal a strikingly consistent pattern: all models achieve perfect accuracy on the base tasks and remain fully generalise to redundant rule deletion and all equivalence-based rewrites (single or multi-law), but fail sharply under essential rule deletion (dropping to 25% accuracy) and collapse completely in the presence of explicit contradictions (0% accuracy). These results demonstrate that LLMs possess stable invariance to semantic-preserving logical transformations, yet remain fundamentally brittle to missing or conflicting evidence. Our framework provides a clean diagnostic tool for isolating such reasoning failure modes and highlights persistent gaps in the logical generalisation abilities of current LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u903b\u8f91\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u89c4\u5219\u5220\u9664\u3001\u77db\u76fe\u8bc1\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u91cd\u5199\u3001\u591a\u6cd5\u5219\u53e0\u52a0\uff09\u68c0\u9a8c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u53d8\u6362\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u89c4\u5219\u7f3a\u5931\u548c\u77db\u76fe\u8bc1\u636e\u6781\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u56db\u79cd\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u89c4\u5219\u5220\u9664\uff08\u5197\u4f59/\u5173\u952e\uff09\u3001\u77db\u76fe\u8bc1\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u91cd\u5199\uff08\u516d\u7c7b\u7b49\u4ef7\u5f8b\uff09\u3001\u591a\u6cd5\u5219\u53e0\u52a0\uff082-5\u4e2a\u53d8\u6362\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728BERT\u3001Qwen2\u3001LLaMA-like\u4e09\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u89c4\u5219\u5220\u9664\u3001\u5355/\u591a\u6cd5\u5219\u7b49\u4ef7\u91cd\u5199\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230100%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u5173\u952e\u89c4\u5219\u5220\u9664\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9aa4\u964d\u81f325%\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u77db\u76fe\u8bc1\u636e\u5219\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u6548\uff080%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u53d8\u6362\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u51b2\u7a81\u8bc1\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($\u03b1$) and biological ($\u03b2$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecfKoopman\u673a\u5668\uff08NKM\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8870\u9000\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7eb5\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "NKM\u878d\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u6790\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u03b1\uff09\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u03b2\uff09\u6307\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7ec4\u4e0e\u5c42\u7ea7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u878d\u5408\u5206\u7ec4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f68\u8ff9\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728ADNI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNKM\u5728\u591a\u8ba4\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u540c\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u80fd\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5bf9\u5404\u8ba4\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6700\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba4\u77e5\u6076\u5316\u7684\u8111\u533a\u3002", "conclusion": "NKM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAD\u8ba4\u77e5\u8870\u9000\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AD\u8fdb\u5c55\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

It evaluates their effectiveness through metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and diversity in recommendations. The results demonstrate that GNNs are particularly adept at managing complex item relationships in e-commerce environments, whereas RNNs are effective in capturing the temporal dynamics that are essential for platforms such as Netflix.. Siamese Networks are emphasized for their contribution to the diversification of recommendations, particularly in retail settings. Despite their benefits, issues like computational demands, reliance on extensive data, and the challenge of balancing accurate and diverse recommendations are addressed.

To overcome this, methods excluding electronics from the operating environment while retaining advanced electronic control and actuation have been explored. These include the remote hydraulic drive of electronics-free mobile robots, which offer high reachability, and long wire-driven robot arms with motors consolidated at the base, which offer high environmental resistance. To combine the advantages of both, this study proposes a new system, \"Remote Wire Drive.\" As a proof-of-concept, we designed and developed the Remote Wire-Driven robot \"REWW-ARM\", which consists of the following components: 1) a novel power transmission mechanism, the \"Remote Wire Transmission Mechanism\" (RWTM), the key technology of the Remote Wire Drive; 2) an electronics-free distal mobile robot driven by it; and 3) a motor-unit that generates power and provides electronic closed-loop control based on state estimation via the RWTM. In this study, we evaluated the mechanical and control performance of REWW-ARM through several experiments, demonstrating its capability for locomotion, posture control, and object manipulation both on land and underwater.

While most prior retrieval methods assist in identifying relevant passages for QA, further assessing the utility of the passages can help in removing redundant ones, which may otherwise add to noise and inaccuracies in the generated answers. Existing utility prediction approaches model passage utility independently, overlooking a critical aspect of multihop reasoning: the utility of a passage can be context-dependent, influenced by its relation to other passages - whether it provides complementary information or forms a crucial link in conjunction with others. In this paper, we propose a lightweight approach to model contextual passage utility, accounting for inter-passage dependencies. We fine-tune a small transformer-based model to predict passage utility scores for multihop QA. We leverage the reasoning traces from an advanced reasoning model to capture the order in which passages are used to answer a question and obtain synthetic training data.

The literature on adversarially robust Deep Learning attempts to either enhance the robustness of neural networks (e.g, via adversarial training) or to certify their decisions up to a given robustness level (e.g, by using randomized smoothing, formal methods or Lipschitz bounds). These studies mostly focus on classification tasks and few efficient certification procedures currently exist for semantic segmentation. In this work, we introduce a new class of certifiably robust Semantic Segmentation networks with built-in Lipschitz constraints that are efficiently trainable and achieve competitive pixel accuracy on challenging datasets such as Cityscapes. Additionally, we provide a novel framework that generalizes robustness certificates for semantic segmentation tasks, where we showcase the flexibility and computational efficiency of using Lipschitz networks. Our approach unlocks real-time compatible certifiably robust semantic segmentation for the first time. Moreover, it allows the computation of worst-case performance under $\\ell_2$ attacks of radius $\u03b5$ across a wide range of performance measures. Crucially, we benchmark the runtime of our certification process and find our approach to be around 600 times faster than randomized smoothing methods at inference with comparable certificates on an NVIDIA A100 GPU.

This is because the vast majority of existing methodologies exploit various levels of approximations that lower accuracy and limit the flexibility of kernel and noise-model designs -- an unacceptable drawback at a time when expressive non-stationary kernels are on the rise in many fields. Here, we propose a methodology we term \\emph{gp2Scale} that scales exact Gaussian processes to more than 10 million data points without relying on inducing points, kernel interpolation, or neighborhood-based approximations, and instead leveraging the existing capabilities of a GP: its kernel design. Highly flexible, compactly supported, and non-stationary kernels lead to the identification of naturally occurring sparse structure in the covariance matrix, which is then exploited for the calculations of the linear system solution and the log-determinant for training. We demonstrate our method's functionality on several real-world datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art approximation algorithms. Although we show superior approximation performance in many cases, the method's real power lies in its agnosticism toward arbitrary GP customizations -- core kernel design, noise, and mean functions -- and the type of input space, making it optimally suited for modern Gaussian process applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3agp2Scale\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u7d27\u652f\u6491\u4e14\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7684\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u7cbe\u786e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u5343\u4e07\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08\u5982\u8bf1\u5bfc\u70b9\u3001\u6838\u63d2\u503c\u6216\u90bb\u57df\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u6838\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65e5\u76ca\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6838\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fagp2Scale\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7d27\u652f\u6491\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6838\u6784\u9020\u7a00\u758f\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6570\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786eGP\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u6838\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5747\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "gp2Scale\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6-\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u5b9a\u5236\u6027\u4e09\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent work explores multimodal representations for behavior retrieval in the General Search Unit (GSU), they often neglect multimodal integration in the fine-grained modeling stage -- the Exact Search Unit (ESU). In this work, we present a systematic analysis of how to effectively leverage multimodal signals across both stages of the two-stage lifelong modeling framework. Our key insight is that simplicity suffices in the GSU: lightweight cosine similarity with high-quality multimodal embeddings outperforms complex retrieval mechanisms. In contrast, the ESU demands richer multimodal sequence modeling and effective ID-multimodal fusion to unlock its full potential. Guided by these principles, we propose MUSE, a simple yet effective multimodal search-based framework.

The design first formulates an extended linear time-varying (LTV) system to estimate body-frame position, body-frame velocity, and the gravity direction. The recovered gravity direction, combined with the body-frame vector measurement, is then used to reconstruct the full orientation on $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$, resulting in a cascaded observer architecture. Almost Global Asymptotic Stability (AGAS) of the cascaded design is established under a uniform observability condition, ensuring robustness to sensor noise and trajectory variations.

While simple prompting strategies have shown success on factual questions, they frequently fail on inferential ones that require reasoning beyond direct text extraction. We hypothesize that asking a model to first reason about what specific information is missing provides a more reliable, implicit signal for assessing overall sufficiency. To this end, we propose a structured Identify-then-Verify framework for robust sufficiency modeling. Our method first generates multiple hypotheses about missing information and establishes a semantic consensus. It then performs a critical verification step, forcing the model to re-examine the source text to confirm whether this information is truly absent. We evaluate our method against established baselines across diverse multi-hop and factual QA datasets. The results demonstrate that by guiding the model to justify its claims about missing information, our framework produces more accurate sufficiency judgments while clearly articulating any information gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIdentify-then-Verify\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5145\u5206\u6027\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5148\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u5171\u8bc6\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u518d\u56de\u6eaf\u539f\u6587\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u786e\u5b9e\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5224\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u542b\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u800c\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u9700\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u4ee5\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIdentify-then-Verify\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5171\u8bc6\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u5931\u9879\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u6eaf\u539f\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u8be5\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5426\u771f\u5b9e\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7c7b\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u5145\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6e05\u6670\u63ed\u793a\u5177\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5176\u6240\u58f0\u79f0\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u606f\u5145\u5206\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

However, conventional powder characterization methods are low-throughput and qualitative, failing to capture the heterogeneity of industrial-scale batches. We present an automated, machine learning framework that couples high-throughput imaging with shape extraction and clustering to profile metallic powder morphology at scale. We develop and evaluate three clustering pipelines: an autoencoder pipeline, a shape-descriptor pipeline, and a functional-data pipeline. Across a dataset of approximately 126,000 powder images (0.5-102 micrometer diameter), internal validity metrics identify the Fourier-descriptor + k-means pipeline as the most effective, achieving the lowest Davies-Bouldin index and highest Calinski-Harabasz score while maintaining sub-millisecond runtime per particle on a standard desktop workstation. Although the present work focuses on establishing the morphological-clustering framework, the resulting shape groups form a basis for future studies examining their relationship to flowability, packing density, and SLM part quality. Overall, this unsupervised learning framework enables rapid, automated assessment of powder morphology and supports tracking of shape evolution across reuse cycles, offering a path toward real-time feedstock monitoring in SLM workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u6210\u50cf\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8868\u5f81\u91d1\u5c5e\u7c89\u672b\u5f62\u8c8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347SLM\u5de5\u827a\u4e2d\u7c89\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7c89\u672b\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u91cf\u4f4e\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u6279\u6b21\u7684\u5f62\u8c8c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86SLM\u96f6\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff08\u5982\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff09+k-means\u3001\u51fd\u6570\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea612.6\u4e07\u5f20\u91d1\u5c5e\u7c89\u672b\u56fe\u50cf\uff080.5\u2013102\u5fae\u7c73\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08Davies-Bouldin\u6307\u6570\u3001Calinski-Harabasz\u5206\u6570\uff09\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8017\u65f6\u7b5b\u9009\u6700\u4f18\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26+k-means\u6d41\u7a0b\u6700\u4f18\uff1aDavies-Bouldin\u6307\u6570\u6700\u4f4e\u3001Calinski-Harabasz\u5206\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u5355\u9897\u7c92\u5904\u7406\u8017\u65f6<1\u6beb\u79d2\uff1b\u6240\u83b7\u5f62\u8c8c\u7c07\u53ef\u652f\u6491\u540e\u7eed\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u6253\u5370\u8d28\u91cf\u5173\u8054\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7c89\u672b\u5f62\u8c8c\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u8c8c\u6f14\u5316\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u4e3aSLM\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fdb\u6599\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Despite this achievement, LLMs, as data-driven systems, often make incorrect predictions, which can lead to potential losses in safety-critical scenarios. To address this issue and measure the confidence of model outputs, multiple uncertainty quantification(UQ) criteria have been proposed. However, even though important, there are limited tools to integrate these methods, hindering the practical usage of UQ methods and future research in this domain. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce UncertaintyZoo, a unified toolkit that integrates 29 uncertainty quantification methods, covering five major categories under a standardized interface. Using UncertaintyZoo, we evaluate the usefulness of existing uncertainty quantification methods under the code vulnerability detection task on CodeBERT and ChatGLM3 models. The results demonstrate that UncertaintyZoo effectively reveals prediction uncertainty.

To address this challenge, this work introduces a new tool from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that goes beyond classical information-theoretic measures. We identify limitations in existing approaches for invariant representation learning that solely rely on classical information-theoretic measures, motivating the need to precisely focus on redundant information about the target $Y$ shared between spurious subgraphs $G_s$ and invariant subgraphs $G_c$ obtained via PID. Next, we propose a new multi-level optimization framework that we call -- Redundancy-guided Invariant Graph learning (RIG) -- that maximizes redundant information while isolating spurious and causal subgraphs, enabling OOD generalization under diverse distribution shifts. Our approach relies on alternating between estimating a lower bound of redundant information (which itself requires an optimization) and maximizing it along with additional objectives. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our proposed RIG framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u89e3\uff08PID\uff09\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0d\u53d8\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08RIG\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cfY\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u53bb\u9664\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u89e3\uff08PID\uff09\u523b\u753b\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cfY\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5b50\u56feG_c\u4e0e\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u56feG_s\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6RIG\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8be5\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u56fe\u5206\u79bb\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRIG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PID\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53d8\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0cRIG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This graph-based view has motivated the rapid adoption of graph neural networks (GNNs), which often outperform collaborative filtering (CF) methods such as latent factor models, deep neural networks, and generative strategies. Yet, despite their empirical success, the reasons why GNNs offer systematic advantages over other CF approaches remain only partially understood. This monograph advances a topology-centered perspective on GNN-based recommendation. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of these models' performance should consider the structural properties of user-item graphs and their interaction with GNN architectural design. To support this view, we introduce a formal taxonomy that distills common modeling patterns across eleven representative GNN-based recommendation approaches and consolidates them into a unified conceptual pipeline. We further formalize thirteen classical and topological characteristics of recommendation datasets and reinterpret them through the lens of graph machine learning. Using these definitions, we analyze the considered GNN-based recommender architectures to assess how and to what extent they encode such properties.

Addressing this gap, this study develops a tailored planning model for Qena City. Using a hybrid methodology (descriptive, analytical, and experimental), the research utilizes Python programming to generate an intelligent spatial analysis algorithm based on Voronoi Diagrams. This approach creates city-specific planning criteria and evaluates the current coverage of public facilities. The primary contribution of this study is the successful derivation of a localized planning standards model and the deployment of an automated algorithm to assess service efficiency. Application of this model reveals a general service coverage average of 81.3%. Ambulance stations demonstrated the highest efficiency (99.8%) due to recent upgrades, while parks and open spaces recorded the lowest coverage (10%) caused by limited land availability.

We propose PMA-Diffusion, a physics-guided mask-aware diffusion framework that reconstructs unobserved highway speed fields from sparse, incomplete observations. Our approach trains a diffusion prior directly on sparsely observed speed fields using two mask-aware training strategies: Single-Mask and Double-Mask. At the inference phase, the physics-guided posterior sampler alternates reverse-diffusion updates, observation projection, and physics-guided projection based on adaptive anisotropic smoothing to reconstruct the missing speed fields. The proposed framework is tested on the I-24 MOTION dataset with varying visibility ratios. Even under severe sparsity, with only 5% visibility, PMA-Diffusion outperforms other baselines across three reconstruction error metrics. Furthermore, PMA-diffusion trained with sparse observation nearly matches the performance of the baseline model trained on fully observed speed fields.

In RecSys, the retrieval stage is also follows a 'next-token prediction' paradigm, to recall the hunderds of items from the global item set, thus the generative recommendation usually refers specifically to the retrieval stage (without Tree-based methods). This raises a philosophical question: without a ground-truth next item, does the generative recommendation also holds a potential scaling law? In retrospect, the generative recommendation has two different technique paradigms: (1) ANN-based framework, utilizing the compressed user embedding to retrieve nearest other items in embedding space, e.g, Kuaiformer. (2) Auto-regressive-based framework, employing the beam search to decode the item from whole space, e.g, OneRec.

We formalize five human-centered objectives and cast safety as lexicographic constrained generation: first, applying hard constraints to eliminate harmful continuations; then optimizing for prosocial quality within the safe set. Our method combines (i) directional regulation, a harm-mitigation mechanism that subtracts a learned \"harm vector\" in parameter space, and (ii) preference-aware autoregressive reward modeling trained jointly across attributes with gradient conflict resolution, enabling fine-grained, user-controllable decoding. Empirical evaluations across five safety benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing unsafe leakage and boosting alignment to human values, with strong gains across multiple evaluation metrics. ProSocialAlign offers a robust and modular foundation for generating context-sensitive, safe, and human-aligned responses at inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faProSocialAlign\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u4e14\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5f3a\u70c8\u6216\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u5355\u7eaf\u62d2\u7edd\u4f1a\u758f\u8fdc\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u76f2\u76ee\u670d\u4ece\u5219\u52a0\u5267\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProSocialAlign\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(i) \u65b9\u5411\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\uff08\u51cf\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u2018\u6709\u5bb3\u5411\u91cf\u2019\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u5371\u5bb3\uff09\uff1b(ii) \u504f\u597d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u91c7\u7528\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\uff1a\u5148\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u5254\u9664\u6709\u5bb3\u7eed\u5199\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u5408\u5185\u4f18\u5316\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8f93\u51fa\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u591a\u9879\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5747\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ProSocialAlign\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

The performance is assessed in terms of accuracy, query speed, and other relevant metrics.

In this paper, we present a workflow for transforming such documents into structured data using a combination of multimodal large language models (LLMs), an ontology-based reasoning model, and a custom extension of the Linked Art framework. We show how vision-language models can accurately parse and transcribe born-digital and digitised programmes, achieving over 98% of correct extraction. To overcome the challenges of semantic annotation, we train a reasoning model (POntAvignon) using reinforcement learning with both formal and semantic rewards.

A causality-consistent PH model is introduced for mass-spring-damper impedance in Cartesian space. Based on this model, a differentiable, force-torque sensing-independent, n-DoF passivity condition is derived, valid for time-varying references. An impedance fidelity metric is also defined from step-response power in free motion, capturing dynamic decoupling.

Despite recent progress, existing approaches either fail to capture nuanced user preferences or lack effective mechanisms to encode personalized visual signals. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to extract rich user representations and inject them into diffusion-based image generation. We train the MLLM with a preference-oriented visual question answering task to capture fine-grained semantic cues. To isolate preference-relevant features, we introduce two complementary probing tasks: inter-user discrimination to distinguish between different users, and intra-user discrimination to separate liked from disliked content. To ensure compatibility with diffusion text encoders, we design a maximum mean discrepancy-based alignment loss that bridges the modality gap while preserving multimodal structure. The resulting embeddings are used to condition the generator, enabling faithful adherence to both prompts and user preferences.

To resolve this, we propose FlatFormer, a streamlined architecture based on the novel design paradigm of ``Information Injection over Structural Stacking.'' Unlike parameter-heavy hierarchical models, FlatFormer leverages a standard flat Transformer augmented with two lightweight injection mechanisms: (i) a hybrid input encoding strategy combining learnable session identifiers with fixed sinusoidal step embeddings; and (ii) a pre-computed power-law bias integrated directly into attention logits to explicitly model the forgetting curve. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets (e.g., EdNet, Junyi) show that FlatFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, on the EdNet dataset, compared to the strongest hierarchical baseline (HiTSKT), its absolute AUC increased by 8.3%, while using less than 15% of parameters, and inference speed was about three times faster.

The key point in applying test-time scaling to DLRS lies in effectively generating diverse yet meaningful outputs for the same instance. We propose two ways: One is to explore the heterogeneity of different model architectures. The other is to utilize the randomness of model initialization under a homogeneous architecture. The evaluation is conducted across eight models, including both classic and SOTA models, on three benchmarks. Sufficient evidence proves the effectiveness of both solutions.

To address the high computational cost of dense visual reconstruction in long-term ocean wave observation tasks and the challenges introduced by persistent visual occlusions, we propose an wave free surface visual reconstruction neural network, which is designed as an attention-augmented pyramid architecture tailored to the multi-scale and temporally continuous characteristics of wave motions. Using physics-based constraints, we perform time-resolved reconstruction of nonlinear 3D velocity fields from the evolving free-surface boundary. Experiments under real-sea conditions demonstrate millimetre-level wave elevation prediction in the central region, dominant-frequency errors below 0.01 Hz, precise estimation of high-frequency spectral power laws, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction of nonlinear velocity fields, while enabling dense reconstruction of two million points in only 1.35 s.

Building upon this foundation, recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have further empowered models to autonomously and strategically control search tool usage, optimizing when and how to query external knowledge sources. Yet, these RL-driven DeepSearch systems often reveal a see-saw trade-off between accuracy and efficiency-frequent tool invocations can improve factual correctness but lead to unnecessary computational overhead and diminished efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose LightSearcher, an efficient RL framework that incorporates textual experiential memory by learning contrastive reasoning trajectories to generate interpretable summaries of successful reasoning patterns. In addition, it employs an adaptive reward shaping mechanism that penalizes redundant tool calls only in correct-answer scenarios.

We propose \\emph{Temporal Range}, a model-agnostic metric that treats first-order sensitivities of multiple vector outputs across a temporal window to the input sequence as a temporal influence profile and summarizes it by the magnitude-weighted average lag. Temporal Range is computed via reverse-mode automatic differentiation from the Jacobian blocks $\\partial y_s/\\partial x_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{c\\times d}$ averaged over final timesteps $s\\in\\{t+1,\\dots,T\\}$ and is well-characterized in the linear setting by a small set of natural axioms. Across diagnostic and control tasks (POPGym; flicker/occlusion; Copy-$k$) and architectures (MLPs, RNNs, SSMs), Temporal Range (i) remains small in fully observed control, (ii) scales with the task's ground-truth lag in Copy-$k$, and (iii) aligns with the minimum history window required for near-optimal return as confirmed by window ablations. We also report Temporal Range for a compact Long Expressive Memory (LEM) policy trained on the task, using it as a proxy readout of task-level memory. Our axiomatic treatment draws on recent work on range measures, specialized here to temporal lag and extended to vector-valued outputs in the RL setting. Temporal Range thus offers a practical per-sequence readout of memory dependence for comparing agents and environments and for selecting the shortest sufficient context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807Temporal Range\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u654f\u611f\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9645\u5229\u7528\u5176\u8fc7\u53bb\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5b9a\u91cf\u523b\u753b\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTemporal Range\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u5411\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u5757\u2202y_s/\u2202x_t\uff0c\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65s\u2208{t+1,\u2026,T}\u53d6\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5e45\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u6ede\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u603b\u7ed3\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7531\u4e00\u7ec4\u81ea\u7136\u516c\u7406\u826f\u597d\u523b\u753b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(i) \u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dTemporal Range\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5c0f\uff1b(ii) \u5728Copy-k\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u771f\u5b9e\u6ede\u540ek\u7f29\u653e\uff1b(iii) \u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f18\u56de\u62a5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5386\u53f2\u7a97\u53e3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u8fd8\u62a5\u544a\u4e86LEM\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684Temporal Range\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8bfb\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "Temporal Range\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u6bcf\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bfb\u51fa\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u77ed\u5145\u5206\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002"}}

From the classical PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), there is a series of deep reinforcement learning algorithms which are widely used in training locomotion policies for quadrupedal robots because of their stability and sample efficiency. However, among all these variants, experiments and simulations often converge prematurely, leading to suboptimal locomotion and reduced task performance. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Entropy-Controlled Intrinsic Motivation (ECIM), an entropy-based reinforcement learning algorithm in contrast with the PPO series, that can reduce premature convergence by combining intrinsic motivation with adaptive exploration.\n  For experiments, in order to parallel with other baselines, we chose to apply it in Isaac Gym across six terrain categories: upward slopes, downward slopes, uneven rough terrain, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and flat ground as widely used.

However, current Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) systems typically exploit isolated linguistic views, thereby overlooking the intricate interplay between structural representations that humans naturally leverage. We propose CMV-Fuse, a Cross-Modal View fusion framework that emulates human language processing by systematically combining multiple linguistic perspectives. Our approach systematically orchestrates four linguistic perspectives: Abstract Meaning Representations, constituency parsing, dependency syntax, and semantic attention, enhanced with external knowledge integration. Through hierarchical gated attention fusion across local syntactic, intermediate semantic, and global knowledge levels, CMV-Fuse captures both fine-grained structural patterns and broad contextual understanding. A novel structure aware multi-view contrastive learning mechanism ensures consistency across complementary representations while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over strong baselines on standard benchmarks, with analysis revealing how each linguistic view contributes to more robust sentiment analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCMV-Fuse\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u3001\u6210\u5206\u53e5\u6cd5\u3001\u4f9d\u5b58\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56db\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u9762\u7ea7\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ABSA\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u591a\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCMV-Fuse\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u56db\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u89c6\u89d2\uff08AMR\u3001\u6210\u5206\u53e5\u6cd5\u3001\u4f9d\u5b58\u53e5\u6cd5\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u8bed\u8a00\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347ABSA\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We explain why the expertise in prompt-based segmentation of SAM2 does not transfer to the multimodal concept-driven paradigm of SAM3. SAM2 operates through spatial prompts points, boxes, and masks yielding purely geometric and temporal segmentation. In contrast, SAM3 introduces a unified vision-language architecture capable of open-vocabulary reasoning, semantic grounding, contrastive alignment, and exemplar-based concept understanding. We structure this analysis through five core components: (1) a Conceptual Break Between Prompt-Based and Concept-Based Segmentation, contrasting spatial prompt semantics of SAM2 with multimodal fusion and text-conditioned mask generation of SAM3; (2) Architectural Divergence, detailing pure vision-temporal design of SAM2 versus integration of vision-language encoders, geometry and exemplar encoders, fusion modules, DETR-style decoders, object queries, and ambiguity-handling via Mixture-of-Experts in SAM3; (3) Dataset and Annotation Differences, contrasting SA-V video masks with multimodal concept-annotated corpora of SAM3; (4) Training and Hyperparameter Distinctions, showing why SAM2 optimization knowledge does not apply to SAM3; and (5) Evaluation, Metrics, and Failure Modes, outlining the transition from geometric IoU metrics to semantic, open-vocabulary evaluation.

In particular, we show that the algorithm converges almost surely to a compact, connected subset of solutions to the average-reward optimality equation, with convergence to a unique, sample path-dependent solution under additional stepsize and asynchrony conditions. Moreover, to make full use of the SA framework, we introduce new monotonicity conditions for estimating the optimal reward rate in RVI Q-learning. These conditions substantially expand the previously considered algorithmic framework and are addressed through novel arguments in the stability and convergence analysis of RVI Q-learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd1\u671f\u5728Borkar-Meyn\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5173\u4e8e\u5f02\u6b65\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\uff08SA\uff09\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u534a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08SMDP\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RVI Q-learning\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5f31\u8fde\u901a\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001SMDP\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u5956\u52b1\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u534a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u7ecf\u5178\u76f8\u5bf9\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\uff08RVI\uff09\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u3001\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eBorkar-Meyn\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6784\u5efaRVI Q-learning\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u5956\u52b1\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86RVI Q-learning\u5728\u5f31\u8fde\u901a\u6709\u9650SMDP\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u7a0b\u89e3\u96c6\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u81f4\u8fde\u901a\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b\u5728\u989d\u5916\u6b65\u957f\u4e0e\u5f02\u6b65\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u552f\u4e00\u4f9d\u8d56\u6837\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5f02\u6b65\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RVI\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1SMDP\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

A camera mounted on the set up captures the scene, and a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)-based vision algorithm is employed to segment an object for grasping and define its bounding box. Grasp contact points are then computed by generating candidate trajectories using Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star algorithm, and selecting fingertip end poses based on the minimum Euclidean distance between these trajectories and the objects point cloud. Each finger grasp pose is determined independently, enabling adaptive, object-specific configurations. Damped Least Square (DLS) based Inverse kinematics solver is used to compute the corresponding joint angles, which are subsequently transmitted to the finger actuators for execution.

Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our methods, showcasing their potential to advance point cloud representation learning by effectively integrating 2D knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e863D\u6570\u636e\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec32D\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u53473D\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c2D\u52303D\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e0e2D\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5668\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u75282D\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53473D\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec32D\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u652f\u63013D\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u70b9\u4e91\u57fa\u5143\u5206\u5272\u3001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u53ca2D\u52303D\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u6574\u54082D\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u60013D\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Yet current evaluation practice, reporting a single accuracy number from a single run, obscures the variance underlying these results, making it impossible to distinguish genuine capability improvements from lucky sampling. We propose adopting Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), a metric from measurement science, to characterize this variance. ICC decomposes observed variance into between-query variance (task difficulty) and within-query variance (agent inconsistency), highlighting whether reported results reflect true capability or measurement noise. We evaluated on GAIA (Levels 1-3, measuring agentic capabilities across varying reasoning complexity) and FRAMES (measuring retrieval and factuality across multiple documents). We found that ICC varies dramatically with task structure, with reasoning and retrieval tasks (FRAMES) exhibit ICC=0.4955-0.7118 across models, and agentic tasks (GAIA) exhibiting ICC=0.304-0.774 across models. For sub-agent replacement decisions in agentic systems, accuracy improvements are only trustworthy if ICC also improves. We demonstrate that ICC converges by n=8-16 trials for structured tasks and n>=32 for complex reasoning, enabling practitioners to set evidence-based resampling budgets. We recommend reporting accuracy alongside ICC and within-query variance as standard practice, and propose updated Evaluation Cards capturing these metrics. By making evaluation stability visible, we aim to transform agentic benchmarking from opaque leaderboard competition to trustworthy experimental science.

Structure domain shifts frequently occur, especially when graph data are collected at different times or from varying areas, resulting in poor performance of GNNs on target graphs. Surprisingly, we find that simply incorporating an auxiliary loss function for denoising graph edges on target graphs can be extremely effective in enhancing GNN performance on target graphs. Based on this insight, we propose our framework, GraphDeT, a framework that integrates this auxiliary edge task into GNN training for node classification under domain adaptation. Our theoretical analysis connects this auxiliary edge task to the graph generalization bound with -distance, demonstrating such auxiliary task can imposes a constraint which tightens the bound and thereby improves generalization.

A hinge mechanism is integrated between the soft Fin-Ray structure and a rigid sensing module, allowing deformation and translation information to be transferred to a bottom crossbeam upon which are an array of marker-tipped pins based on the biomimetic structure of the TacTip vision-based tactile sensor. Deformation patterns captured by an internal camera are processed using a convolutional neural network to infer contact conditions without directly sensing the finger surface. The finger design was optimized by varying pin configurations and hinge orientations, achieving 0.1\\,mm depth and 2mm location-sensing accuracies.

While recent AI video editors perform well on third-person footage, egocentric views present unique challenges - including rapid egomotion and frequent hand-object interactions - that create a significant domain gap. Moreover, existing offline editing pipelines suffer from high latency, limiting real-time interaction. To address these issues, we present a complete ecosystem for egocentric video editing. First, we construct EgoEditData, a carefully designed and manually curated dataset specifically designed for egocentric editing scenarios, featuring rich hand-object interactions, while explicitly preserving hands. Second, we develop EgoEdit, an instruction-following egocentric video editor that supports real-time streaming inference on a single GPU. Finally, we introduce EgoEditBench, an evaluation suite targeting instruction faithfulness, hand and interaction preservation, and temporal stability under egomotion. Across both egocentric and general editing tasks, EgoEdit produces temporally stable, instruction-faithful results with interactive latency. It achieves clear gains on egocentric editing benchmarks-where existing methods struggle-while maintaining performance comparable to the strongest baselines on general editing tasks.

These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated \"Intent Graph\"; and (ii) an innovative \"Tiered Adjudicator\" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff08CCA\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e94\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\uff08IPI\uff09\u653b\u51fb\u3002CCA\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u751f\u6210\u7684\u2018\u610f\u56fe\u56fe\u2019\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u2018\u5206\u5c42\u88c1\u51b3\u5668\u2019\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u79bb\u65f6\u542f\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff08CCA\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(i) \u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u751f\u6210\u2018\u610f\u56fe\u56fe\u2019\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\uff1b(ii) \u80fd\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u79bb\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u5206\u542f\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u2018\u5206\u5c42\u88c1\u51b3\u5668\u2019\u3002", "result": "\u5728AgentDojo\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCCA\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u590d\u6742IPI\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CCA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684IPI\u9632\u5fa1\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

At the same time, real-world deployments almost never serve full-precision models: post-training quantization to INT8 or lower precision is now standard practice for reducing memory and latency. This work asks a simple question: how do existing backdoor defenses behave under standard quantization pipelines? We conduct a systematic empirical study of five representative defenses across three precision settings (FP32, INT8 dynamic, INT4 simulated) and two standard vision benchmarks using a canonical BadNet attack. We observe that INT8 quantization reduces the detection rate of all evaluated defenses to 0% while leaving attack success rates above 99%. For INT4, we find a pronounced dataset dependence: Neural Cleanse remains effective on GTSRB but fails on CIFAR-10, even though backdoors continue to survive quantization with attack success rates above 90%.

However, accurate comprehension is challenging due to a lack of large-scale datasets that capture natural embodied interactions in diverse HRI settings. Existing datasets suffer from perspective bias, single-view collection, inadequate coverage of nonverbal gestures, and a predominant focus on indoor environments. To address these issues, we present the Refer360 dataset, a large-scale dataset of embodied verbal and nonverbal interactions collected across diverse viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor settings. Additionally, we introduce MuRes, a multimodal guided residual module designed to improve embodied referring expression comprehension. MuRes acts as an information bottleneck, extracting salient modality-specific signals and reinforcing them into pre-trained representations to form complementary features for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four HRI datasets, including the Refer360 dataset, and demonstrate that current multimodal models fail to capture embodied interactions comprehensively; however, augmenting them with MuRes consistently improves performance. These findings establish Refer360 as a valuable benchmark and exhibit the potential of guided residual learning to advance embodied referring expression comprehension in robots operating within human environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Refer360\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cMuRes\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u6307\u4ee3\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002Refer360\u8986\u76d6\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\uff1bMuRes\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b8b\u5dee\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2aHRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u6307\u4ee3\u8868\u8fbe\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u624b\u52bf\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ca\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u6df7\u5408\u7684Refer360\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faMuRes\uff08\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b8b\u5dee\u6a21\u5757\uff09\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u5f3a\u5316\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u8fdb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u5f81\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aHRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u542bRefer360\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u5f15\u5165MuRes\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Refer360\u6210\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u6307\u4ee3\u8868\u8fbe\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff1bMuRes\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5177\u8eab\u6307\u4ee4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Personalization is essential, yet early approaches-such as prompt customization or fine-tuning-struggle to reason over implicit preferences, limiting real-world effectiveness. Recent \"think-then-generate\" methods address this by reasoning before response generation. However, they face challenges in long-form generation: their static one-shot reasoning must capture all relevant information for the full response generation, making learning difficult and limiting adaptability to evolving content. To address this issue, we propose FlyThinker, an efficient \"think-while-generating\" framework for personalized long-form generation. FlyThinker employs a separate reasoning model that generates latent token-level reasoning in parallel, which is fused into the generation model to dynamically guide response generation. This design enables reasoning and generation to run concurrently, ensuring inference efficiency. In addition, the reasoning model is designed to depend only on previous responses rather than its own prior outputs, which preserves training parallelism across different positions-allowing all reasoning tokens for training data to be produced in a single forward pass like standard LLM training, ensuring training efficiency.

Project page: https://shoot-bounce-3d.github.io", "summary": "3D scene reconstruction from a single measurement is challenging, especially in the presence of occluded regions and specular materials, such as mirrors. We address these challenges by leveraging single-photon lidars. These lidars estimate depth from light that is emitted into the scene and reflected directly back to the sensor. However, they can also measure light that bounces multiple times in the scene before reaching the sensor. This multi-bounce light contains additional information that can be used to recover dense depth, occluded geometry, and material properties. Prior work with single-photon lidar, however, has only demonstrated these use cases when a laser sequentially illuminates one scene point at a time. We instead focus on the more practical - and challenging - scenario of illuminating multiple scene points simultaneously. The complexity of light transport due to the combined effects of multiplexed illumination, two-bounce light, shadows, and specular reflections is challenging to invert analytically. Instead, we propose a data-driven method to invert light transport in single-photon lidar. To enable this approach, we create the first large-scale simulated dataset of ~100k lidar transients for indoor scenes. We use this dataset to learn a prior on complex light transport, enabling measured two-bounce light to be decomposed into the constituent contributions from each laser spot. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate how this decomposed light can be used to infer 3D geometry in scenes with occlusions and mirrors from a single measurement.

ProAgent first employs a proactive-oriented context extraction approach with on-demand tiered perception to continuously sense the environment and derive hierarchical contexts that incorporate both sensory and persona cues. ProAgent then adopts a context-aware proactive reasoner to map these contexts to user needs and tool calls, providing proactive assistance. We implement ProAgent on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses with an edge server and extensively evaluate it on a real-world testbed, a public dataset, and through a user study. Results show that ProAgent achieves up to 33.4% higher proactive prediction accuracy, 16.8% higher tool-calling F1 score, and notable improvements in user satisfaction over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a significant step toward proactive assistants.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning (RL) is a fundamental challenge to efficient RL algorithms. Existing algorithms for finite state and action discounted RL problems address this by assuming sufficient exploration over both state and action spaces. However, this yields non-implementable algorithms and sub-optimal performance. To resolve these limitations, we introduce a new class of methods with auto-exploration, or methods that automatically explore both state and action spaces in a parameter-free way, i.e.,~without a priori knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. We present two variants: one for the tabular setting and one for linear function approximation. Under algorithm-independent assumptions on the existence of an exploring optimal policy, both methods attain $O(\u03b5^{-2})$ sample complexity to solve to $\u03b5$ error. Crucially, these complexities are novel since they are void of algorithm-dependent parameters seen in prior works, which may be arbitrarily large. The methods are also simple to implement because they are parameter-free and do not directly estimate the unknown parameters. These feats are achieved by new algorithmic innovations for RL, including a dynamic mixing time, a discounted state distribution for sampling, a simple robust gradient estimator, and a recent advantage gap function to certify convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u578b\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86O(\u03b5^{-2})\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u7c7b\u81ea\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5206\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u578b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6298\u6263\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u7b80\u5355\u9c81\u68d2\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53ca\u4f18\u52bf\u95f4\u9699\u51fd\u6570\u7b49\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u5173\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u8fbe\u5230O(\u03b5^{-2})\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u5927\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system that enables humanoid robots to execute robust continual ball-kicking with adaptability to different ball-goal configurations. The system extends a typical teacher-student training framework -- in which a \"teacher\" policy is trained with ground truth state information and the \"student\" learns to mimic it with noisy, imperfect sensing -- by including four training stages: (1) long-distance ball chasing (teacher); (2) directional kicking (teacher); (3) teacher policy distillation (student); and (4) student adaptation and refinement (student). Key design elements -- including tailored reward functions, realistic noise modeling, and online constrained RL for adaptation and refinement -- are critical for closing the sim-to-real gap and sustaining performance under perceptual uncertainty. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and on a real robot demonstrate strong kicking accuracy and goal-scoring success across diverse ball-goal configurations. Ablation studies further highlight the necessity of the constrained RL, noise modeling, and the adaptation stage.

Topic modeling is a widely used approach for uncovering latent themes in text data, typically framed as an unsupervised classification task. However, traditional models, originally designed for longer and more formal documents, struggle with short social media posts due to limited co-occurrence statistics, fragmented semantics, inconsistent spelling, and informal language. To address these challenges, we propose a new method, TopiCLEAR: Topic extraction by CLustering Embeddings with Adaptive dimensional Reduction. Specifically, each text is embedded using Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and provisionally clustered using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The clusters are then refined iteratively using a supervised projection based on linear discriminant analysis, followed by GMM-based clustering until convergence. Notably, our method operates directly on raw text, eliminating the need for preprocessing steps such as stop word removal. We evaluate our approach on four diverse datasets, 20News, AgNewsTitle, Reddit, and TweetTopic, each containing human-labeled topic information. Compared with seven baseline methods, including a recent SBERT-based method and a zero-shot generative AI method, our approach achieves the highest similarity to human-annotated topics, with significant improvements for both social media posts and online news articles. Additionally, qualitative analysis shows that our method produces more interpretable topics, highlighting its potential for applications in social media data and web content analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTopiCLEAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Sentence-BERT\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u964d\u7ef4\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08GMM\uff09\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\uff08LDA\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u77ed\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3b\u9898\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u77ed\u3001\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u3001\u62fc\u5199\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u957f\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "TopiCLEAR\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Sentence-BERT\u5d4c\u5165\u6587\u672c\uff1b\u521d\u59cbGMM\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\uff08LDA\uff09\u6295\u5f71 + GMM\u91cd\u805a\u7c7b\u76f4\u81f3\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u5168\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u505c\u7528\u8bcd\u53bb\u9664\u7b49\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u572820News\u3001AgNewsTitle\u3001Reddit\u548cTweetTopic\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd47\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u542bSBERT\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0cTopiCLEAR\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u9898\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "TopiCLEAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u793e\u4f1a\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, a lot of existing work often relies on either single-view encoders that fail to exploit the spatial structure of multi-camera systems or operate on aggregated multi-view features, which lack a unified spatial representation, making it more challenging to reason about ego-centric directions, object relations, and the wider context. We thus present BeLLA, an end-to-end architecture that connects unified 360\u00b0 BEV representations with a large language model for question answering in autonomous driving. We primarily evaluate our work using two benchmarks - NuScenes-QA and DriveLM, where BeLLA consistently outperforms existing approaches on questions that require greater spatial reasoning, such as those involving relative object positioning and behavioral understanding of nearby objects, achieving up to +9.3% absolute improvement in certain tasks.

The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step. However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task. To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging. Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses. DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials. These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

This research introduces a reinforcement learning technique to learn switching thresholds between two orthogonal navigation policies. Using maze navigation as a case study, this work demonstrates how an agent can dynamically transition between systematic exploration (coverage) and goal-directed pathfinding (convergence) to improve task performance. Unlike fixed-threshold approaches, the agent uses Q-learning to adapt switching behavior based on coverage percentage and distance to goal, requiring only minimal domain knowledge: maze dimensions and target location. The agent does not require prior knowledge of wall positions, optimal threshold values, or hand-crafted heuristics; instead, it discovers effective switching strategies dynamically during each run. The agent discretizes its state space into coverage and distance buckets, then adapts which coverage threshold (20-60\\%) to apply based on observed progress signals. Experiments across 240 test configurations (4 maze sizes from 16$\\times$16 to 128$\\times$128 $\\times$ 10 unique mazes $\\times$ 6 agent variants) demonstrate that adaptive threshold learning outperforms both single-strategy agents and fixed 40\\% threshold baselines. Results show 23-55\\% improvements in completion time, 83\\% reduction in runtime variance, and 71\\% improvement in worst-case scenarios. The learned switching behavior generalizes within each size class to unseen wall configurations.

However, as these systems evolved, the increase in the nonlinear dynamics and the complexity of interconnected variables have posed challenges that classical PID cannot effectively handle, often leading to instability, overshooting, or prolonged settling times. Researchers have proposed PIDNN models that combine the function approximation capabilities of neural networks with PID control to tackle these nonlinear challenges. However, these models require extensive, highly refined training data and have significant computational costs, making them less favorable for real-world applications. In this paper, We propose a novel EC-PIDUNN architecture, which integrates an untrained neural network with an improved PID controller, incorporating a stabilizing factor (\\(\u03c4\\)) to generate the control signal. Like classical PID, our architecture uses the steady-state error \\(e_t\\) as input bypassing the need for explicit knowledge of the systems dynamics. By forming an input vector from \\(e_t\\) within the neural network, we increase the dimensionality of input allowing for richer data representation. Additionally, we introduce a vector of parameters \\( \u03c1_t \\) to shape the output trajectory and a \\textit{dynamic compute} function to adjust the PID coefficients from predefined values. We validate the effectiveness of EC-PIDUNN on multiple nonlinear robotics applications: (1) nonlinear unmanned ground vehicle systems that represent the Ackermann steering mechanism and kinematics control, (2) Pan-Tilt movement system.

However, its growing deployment in real-world applications raises significant concerns regarding its vulnerability to Presentation Attacks (PAs). Effective Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) is therefore critical to ensure the integrity and security of iris-based biometric systems. While conventional iris recognition systems predominantly operate in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, multispectral imaging across multiple NIR bands provides complementary reflectance information that can enhance the generalizability of PAD methods. In this work, we propose \\textbf{SpectraIrisPAD}, a novel deep learning-based framework for robust multispectral iris PAD. The SpectraIrisPAD leverages a DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone equipped with learnable spectral positional encoding, token fusion, and contrastive learning to extract discriminative, band-specific features that effectively distinguish bona fide samples from various spoofing artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce a new comprehensive dataset Multispectral Iris PAD (\\textbf{MSIrPAD}) with diverse PAIs, captured using a custom-designed multispectral iris sensor operating at five distinct NIR wavelengths (800\\,nm, 830\\,nm, 850\\,nm, 870\\,nm, and 980\\,nm). The dataset includes 18,848 iris images encompassing eight diverse PAI categories, including five textured contact lenses, print attacks, and display-based attacks. We conduct comprehensive experiments under unseen attack evaluation protocols to assess the generalization capability of the proposed method. SpectraIrisPAD consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines across all performance metrics, demonstrating superior robustness and generalizability in detecting a wide range of presentation attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u4e0eDINOv2 ViT\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8679\u819c\u5448\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08PAD\uff09\u6846\u67b6SpectraIrisPAD\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u6ce2\u6bb5NIR\u548c\u516b\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6MSIrPAD\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86PAD\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\uff08NIR\uff09\u5355\u6ce2\u6bb5\u4e0b\u6613\u53d7\u5448\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\uff08PA\uff09\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e92\u8865\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347PAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpectraIrisPAD\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eDINOv2 Vision Transformer\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5149\u8c31\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u5177\u6709\u5224\u522b\u529b\u7684\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u8679\u819cPAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6MSIrPAD\uff085\u4e2aNIR\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff0c8\u7c7bPAI\uff0c\u517118,848\u5e45\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\uff0cSpectraIrisPAD\u5728\u5404\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2aSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u8679\u819cPAD\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff1bMSIrPAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, RL for VLMs requires abundant high-quality multimodal data, especially challenging in specialized domains like chemistry, earth sciences, and multimodal mathematics. Existing strategies such as synthetic data and self-rewarding mechanisms suffer from limited distributions and alignment difficulties, ultimately causing reward hacking: models exploit high-reward patterns, collapsing policy entropy and destabilizing training. We propose DoGe (Decouple to Generalize), a dual-decoupling framework that guides models to first learn from context rather than problem solving by refocusing on the problem context scenarios overlooked by synthetic data methods. By decoupling learning process into dual components (Thinker and Solver), we reasonably quantify the reward signals of this process and propose a two-stage RL post-training approach from freely exploring context to practically solving tasks.

Although they can enable the learning of complex intelligent behaviors, such task accessories can result in unnatural task setups and hinder long-term performance in the real world. In this work, we explore the challenges of learning without episode terminations and robot embodiment resets using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. To learn without terminations, we present a continuing version of the SAC algorithm and show that, with simple modifications to the reward functions of existing tasks, continuing SAC can perform as well as or better than episodic SAC while reducing the sensitivity of performance to the value of the discount rate $\u03b3$. On a modified Gym Reacher task, we investigate possible explanations for the failure of continuing SAC when learning without embodiment resets. Our results suggest that embodiment resets help with exploration of the state space in the SAC algorithm, and removing embodiment resets can lead to poor exploration of the state space and failure of or significantly slower learning. Finally, on additional simulated tasks and a real-robot vision task, we show that increasing the entropy of the policy when performance trends worse or remains static is an effective intervention for recovering the performance lost due to not using embodiment resets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u65e0episode\u7ec8\u6b62\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672c\u4f53\u91cd\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdbSoft Actor-Critic\uff08SAC\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86continuing SAC\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u672c\u4f53\u91cd\u7f6e\u5bf9\u63a2\u7d22\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u52a0\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u65e0\u91cd\u7f6e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56episode\u7ec8\u6b62\u548c\u73af\u5883\u91cd\u7f6e\u7b49\u4eba\u5de5\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u867d\u5229\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f46\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u957f\u671f\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51facontinuing SAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u5728Gym Reacher\u7b49\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65e0\u91cd\u7f6e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e72\u9884\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "continuing SAC\u5728\u65e0episode\u7ec8\u6b62\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u6301\u5e73\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6SAC\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6298\u6263\u7387\u03b3\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff1b\u79fb\u9664\u672c\u4f53\u91cd\u7f6e\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u71b5\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u65e0\u91cd\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "episode\u7ec8\u6b62\u975e\u5fc5\u9700\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u4f53\u91cd\u7f6e\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41RL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SAC\uff09\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u63a2\u7d22\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u517c\u987e\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8865\u507f\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Many studies, however, do not sufficiently analyze the relative priorities among evaluation metrics, which compromises the fair assessment of methods with divergent objectives. Furthermore, trajectory-continuity metrics, specifically those requiring $C^2$ smoothness, are rarely incorporated. Current DRL approaches generally prioritize efficiency and proximal comfort, often neglecting trajectory optimization or addressing it only through simplistic, unvalidated smoothness reward. Nevertheless, effective trajectory optimization is essential to ensure naturalness, enhance comfort, and maximize the energy efficiency of any navigation system. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a unified framework that enables the fair and transparent assessment of navigation methods by examining the prioritization and joint evaluation of multiple optimization objectives. We further propose a novel reward-shaping strategy that explicitly emphasizes trajectory-curvature optimization. The resulting trajectory quality and adaptability are significantly enhanced across multi-scale scenarios. Through extensive 2D and 3D experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u900f\u660e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u8c03\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f2\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u5145\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e14\u5f88\u5c11\u8003\u8651C\u00b2\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7b49\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u516c\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u5f0f\u5f3a\u8c03\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f2\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u548c3D\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u517c\u987e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u4e0eC\u00b2\u5e73\u6ed1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3001\u8212\u9002\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aDRL\u5bfc\u822a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, real-world interactions often contain implicit biases, inferred subtly through names, cultural cues, or traits. This critical oversight creates a significant blind spot in fairness evaluation. We introduce ImplicitBBQ, a benchmark extending the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) with implicitly cued protected attributes across 6 categories. Our evaluation of GPT-4o on ImplicitBBQ illustrates troubling performance disparity from explicit BBQ prompts, with accuracy declining up to 7% in the \"sexual orientation\" subcategory and consistent decline located across most other categories. This indicates that current LLMs contain implicit biases undetected by explicit benchmarks.

However, model opacity and the lack of interpretability remain critical barriers to clinical adoption, as clinicians often struggle to trust the decision-making processes of black-box models. To address this gap, we present a Cross-modal Explainable Framework for Melanoma (CEFM) that leverages contrastive learning as the core mechanism for achieving interpretability. Specifically, CEFM maps clinical criteria for melanoma diagnosis-namely Asymmetry, Border, and Color (ABC)-into the Vision Transformer embedding space using dual projection heads, thereby aligning clinical semantics with visual features. The aligned representations are subsequently translated into structured textual explanations via natural language generation, creating a transparent link between raw image data and clinical interpretation. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate 92.79% accuracy and an AUC of 0.961, along with significant improvements across multiple interpretability metrics. Qualitative analyses further show that the spatial arrangement of the learned embeddings aligns with clinicians' application of the ABC rule, effectively bridging the gap between high-performance classification and clinical trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6CEFM\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u6807\u51c6\uff08ABC\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u5230ViT\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1 melanoma \u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ed1\u8272\u7d20\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u533b\u751f\u96be\u4ee5\u4fe1\u4efb\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6CEFM\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6295\u5f71\u5934\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8aABC\u6807\u51c6\u6620\u5c04\u81f3Vision Transformer\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.79%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.961 AUC\uff0c\u591a\u9879\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6307\u6807\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u533b\u751f\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u7684ABC\u89c4\u5219\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "CEFM\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u843d\u5730\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement learning (RL) are adopted to optimize our model.

However, traditional RMABs assume independence among arms, limiting their ability to account for interactions between individuals that can be common and significant in a real-world environment. This paper introduces Networked RMAB, a novel framework that integrates the RMAB model with the independent cascade model to capture interactions between arms in networked environments. We define the Bellman equation for networked RMAB and present its computational challenge due to exponentially large action and state spaces. To resolve the computational challenge, we establish the submodularity of Bellman equation and apply the hill-climbing algorithm to achieve a $1-\\frac{1}{e}$ approximation guarantee in Bellman updates.

We propose a framework for autonomous dynamic soaring with a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The framework makes use of an explicit representation of the wind field and a classical approach for guidance and control of the UAV. Robustness to wind field estimation error is achieved by constructing point-wise robust reference paths for dynamic soaring and the development of a robust path following controller for the fixed-wing UAV. The framework is evaluated in dynamic soaring scenarios in simulation and real flight tests. In simulation, we demonstrate robust dynamic soaring flight subject to varied wind conditions, estimation errors and disturbances. Critical components of the framework, including energy predictions and path-following robustness, are further validated in real flights to assure small sim-to-real gap.

We present \\emph{Track4DGen}, a two-stage framework that couples a multi-view video diffusion model with a foundation point tracker and a hybrid 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) reconstructor. The central idea is to explicitly inject tracker-derived motion priors into intermediate feature representations for both multi-view video generation and 4D-GS. In Stage One, we enforce dense, feature-level point correspondences inside the diffusion generator, producing temporally consistent features that curb appearance drift and enhance cross-view coherence. In Stage Two, we reconstruct a dynamic 4D-GS using a hybrid motion encoding that concatenates co-located diffusion features (carrying Stage-One tracking priors) with Hex-plane features, and augment them with 4D Spherical Harmonics for higher-fidelity dynamics modeling. \\emph{Track4DGen} surpasses baselines on both multi-view video generation and 4D generation benchmarks, yielding temporally stable, text-editable 4D assets.

We investigate the impact of persona prompting on strategic performance in PERIL, a world-domination board game. Specifically, we compare the effectiveness of persona-derived heuristic strategies to those chosen manually. Our findings reveal that certain personas associated with strategic thinking improve game performance, but only when a mediator is used to translate personas into heuristic values. We introduce this mediator as a structured translation process, inspired by exploratory factor analysis, that maps LLM-generated inventory responses into heuristics. Results indicate our method enhances heuristic reliability and face validity compared to directly inferred heuristics, allowing us to better study the effect of persona types on decision making.

Inspired by cognitive science, MIND-V bridges high-level reasoning with pixel-level synthesis through three core components: a Semantic Reasoning Hub (SRH) that leverages a pre-trained vision-language model for task planning; a Behavioral Semantic Bridge (BSB) that translates abstract instructions into domain-invariant representations; and a Motor Video Generator (MVG) for conditional video rendering. MIND-V employs Staged Visual Future Rollouts, a test-time optimization strategy to enhance long-horizon robustness. To align the generated videos with physical laws, we introduce a GRPO reinforcement learning post-training phase guided by a novel Physical Foresight Coherence (PFC) reward.

Their behavior on isolated words is less understood. We show that simply prepending semantic prompts to words before embedding substantially improves word similarity correlations. Testing 7 text embedding models, including text-embedding-3-large (OpenAI), embed-english-v3.0 (Cohere), voyage-3(Voyage AI), all-mpnet-base-v2, and Qwen3-Embedding-8B, on 3 standard benchmarks (SimLex-999, WordSim-353, MEN-3000), we find that prompts like \"meaning: {word}\" or \"Represent the semantic concept: {word}\" improve Spearman correlations by up to +0.29 on SimLex-999. Some models fail completely on bare words (correlation = 0) but recover with prompts (+0.73 improvement).

However, their ability to plan over long horizons is limited by the effective memory span of the backbone architecture. This limitation leads to perceptual drift in long rollouts, hindering the model's capacity to perform loop closures within imagined trajectories. In this work, we investigate the effective memory span of transformer-based world models through an analysis of several memory augmentation mechanisms. We introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes between memory encoding and memory injection mechanisms, motivating their roles in extending the world model's memory through the lens of residual stream dynamics. Using a state recall evaluation task, we measure the memory recall of each mechanism and analyze its respective trade-offs. Our findings show that memory mechanisms improve the effective memory span in vision transformers and provide a path to completing loop closures within a world model's imagination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8de8\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u5206\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u56de\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8de8\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u60f3\u8c61\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e3b\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8de8\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u6f14\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u60f3\u8c61\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u533a\u5206\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u56de\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53ec\u56de\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4e2d\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8de8\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5728\u60f3\u8c61\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6309\u7f16\u7801/\u6ce8\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u671f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u957f\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We address this challenge by jointly modeling linguistic interactions and user influence.

The core of our framework is a Poisson Deconvolution Factorization (PDF) that decomposes this graph into a low-rank topical structure and topic-localized residual interactions, producing an interpretable topic--keyword basis together with topic importance scores. A decorrelation regularizer \\emph{promotes} distinct topics, and a lightweight optimization procedure ensures stable convergence under nonnegativity and normalization constraints. Finally, the number of topics is selected through a coherence-driven sweep that evaluates the quality and distinctness of the learned topics.

However, routing and aggregating in MoE face intrinsic challenges, including imprecise expert selection due to flawed routing strategy and inefficient expert aggregation leading to suboptimal prediction. To address these issues, we propose a statistic-augmented, decoupled MoE }outing and Aggregating Mechanism (MoE-RAM) driven by LM. Specifically, on the one hand, MoE-RAM enhances expert routing by incorporating statistical retrieval mechanism to match LM-extracted latent features with cached prototypical features of the most relevant experts; on the other hand, MoE-RAM adaptively reweights experts' outputs in fusion by measuring statistical distances of experts' instant features against LM-extracted latent features. Benefiting from the synergy of the statistic-augmented MoE's routing and aggregating, MoE-RAM ultimately improves the prediction performance. We take the AD semantic segmentation task as an example to assess the proposed MoE-RAM. Extensive experiments on AD datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoE-RAM compared to other MoE baselines and conventional single-model approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u89e3\u8026MoE\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff08MoE-RAM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u4e00\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u591a\u53d8\u590d\u6742\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u9053\u8def\u7c7b\u578b\u7b49\uff09\uff1b\u4f20\u7edfMoE\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoE-RAM\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u539f\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u7531\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u8ddd\u79bb\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u5404\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cMoE-RAM\u5728\u591a\u4e2aAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u7c7bMoE\u57fa\u7ebf\u53ca\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u8def\u7531-\u805a\u5408\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MoE\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Despite evaluating many samples in deployment, these evaluators typically (i) treat each case independently, missing the opportunity to accumulate experience, and (ii) rely on a single fixed prompt for all cases, neglecting the need for sample-specific evaluation criteria. We introduce Learning While Evaluating (LWE), a framework that allows evaluators to improve sequentially at inference time without requiring training or validation sets. LWE maintains an evolving meta-prompt that (i) produces sample-specific evaluation instructions and (ii) refines itself through self-generated feedback. Furthermore, we propose Selective LWE, which updates the meta-prompt only on self-inconsistent cases, focusing computation where it matters most. This selective approach retains the benefits of sequential learning while being far more cost-effective. Across two pairwise comparison benchmarks, Selective LWE outperforms strong baselines, empirically demonstrating that evaluators can improve during sequential testing with a simple selective update, learning most from the cases they struggle with.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLearning While Evaluating (LWE)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u80fd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faSelective LWE\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u81ea\u8bc4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u66f4\u65b0\u5143\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM-as-a-judge\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u79ef\u7d2f\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLWE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5143\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1Selective LWE\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u8bc4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u624d\u66f4\u65b0\u5143\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSelective LWE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u53ef\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fb9\u8bc4\u8fb9\u5b66\uff0c\u4e14\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

In the physics of shadow formation, the occluder blocks some light rays casting from the light source that would otherwise arrive at the surface, creating a shadow that follows the silhouette of the occluder. However, such explicit physical modeling has rarely been used in deep-learning-based shadow generation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that embeds explicit physical modeling - geometry and illumination - into deep-learning-based shadow generation. First, given a monocular RGB image, we obtain approximate 3D geometry in the form of dense point maps and predict a single dominant light direction. These signals allow us to recover fairly accurate shadow location and shape based on the physics of shadow formation. We then integrate this physics-based initial estimate into a diffusion framework that refines the shadow into a realistic, high-fidelity appearance while ensuring consistency with scene geometry and illumination. Trained on DESOBAV2, our model produces shadows that are both visually realistic and physically coherent, outperforming existing approaches, especially in scenes with complex geometry or ambiguous lighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5149\u7167\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5f20RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u8ba13D\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u4e3b\u5149\u6e90\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u9634\u5f71\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u5229\u7528\u9634\u5f71\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\uff08\u5982\u906e\u6321\u4f53\u5bf9\u5149\u7ebf\u7684\u963b\u6321\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u5149\u7167\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u5355\u76eeRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a20\u5bc6\u70b9\u4e91\u56fe\u548c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5149\u6e90\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u9634\u5f71\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8be5\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u4f30\u8ba1\u878d\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6700\u7ec8\u9634\u5f71\u5728\u5916\u89c2\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728DESOBAV2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u6216\u5149\u7167\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u878d\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5149\u7167\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9634\u5f71\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target.

We resolve this paradox by identifying entropic barriers arising from the interplay between curvature variations along these paths and noise in optimization dynamics. Empirically, we find that curvature systematically rises away from minima, producing effective forces that bias noisy dynamics back toward the endpoints - even when the loss remains nearly flat. These barriers persist longer than energetic barriers, shaping the late-time localization of solutions in parameter space.

However, FL encounters critical challenges such as poor generalization and slow convergence due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data from diverse driving environments. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce Federated Deep Supervision and Regularization (FedDSR), a paradigm that incorporates multi-access intermediate layer supervision and regularization within federated AD system. Specifically, FedDSR comprises following integral strategies: (I) to select multiple intermediate layers based on predefined architecture-agnostic standards. (II) to compute mutual information (MI) and negative entropy (NE) on those selected layers to serve as intermediate loss and regularizer. These terms are integrated into the output-layer loss to form a unified optimization objective, enabling comprehensive optimization across the network hierarchy. (III) to aggregate models from vehicles trained based on aforementioned rules of (I) and (II) to generate the global model on central server. By guiding and penalizing the learning of feature representations at intermediate stages, FedDSR enhances the model generalization and accelerates model convergence for federated AD. We then take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess FedDSR and apply FedDSR to multiple model architectures and FL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedDSR achieves up to 8.93% improvement in mIoU and 28.57% reduction in training rounds, compared to other FL baselines, making it highly suitable for practical deployment in federated AD ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFedDSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6162\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "FedDSR\u9009\u62e9\u591a\u4e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff08MI\uff09\u548c\u8d1f\u71b5\uff08NE\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u635f\u5931\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cmIoU\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe8.93%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u51cf\u5c1128.57%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedDSR\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Diffusion Language Models (DLMs)--especially block-wise variants--enable parallel generation and intra-block bidirectional reasoning, yet training large DLMs from scratch is costly and wastes the knowledge in mature AR checkpoints. Prior \"adaptation\" attempts either modify logits or randomly grow attention masks to full-sequence diffusion, or simply transplant AR weights into a block-diffusion recipe, leaving a fundamental mismatch between AR causality and block-wise bidirectionality unaddressed. We reframe adaptation as a intra-paradigm path from AR to Block-Diffusion by viewing AR as Block-Diffusion with blocksize=1. Concretely, we design the pathway of adaptation as follows: we use a context-causal attention mask (causal in context, bidirectional only within the active block), an efficient parallel adaptation procedure, an auxiliary AR loss to maximize data utilization and retain pretrained knowledge, and gradual increment of the generation block size. The recipe integrates cleanly with masked block-diffusion and maintains train-inference consistency. Built on these components, NBDiff-7B (Base and Instruct) could inherit the long-context modeling and reasoning capabilities, and achieve state-of-the-art performance among the 7B-class DLMs, delivering strong gains on general-knowledge, math, and code benchmarks over strong baselines. These results demonstrate that principled AR-to-block-diffusion adaptation is an effective and compute-efficient alternative to training DLMs from scratch.

They are crucial for defining the three-dimensional structure of objects and enhancing scene understanding. Yet existing shadow detection methods mainly target cast shadows, and there are no dedicated datasets or models for detecting attached shadows. To address this gap, we introduce a framework that jointly detects cast and attached shadows by reasoning about their mutual relationship with scene illumination and geometry. Our system consists of a shadow detection module that predicts both shadow types separately, and a light estimation module that infers the light direction from the detected shadows. The estimated light direction, combined with surface normals, allows us to derive a geometry-consistent partial map that identifies regions likely to be self-occluded. This partial map is then fed back to refine shadow predictions, forming a closed-loop reasoning process that iteratively improves both shadow segmentation and light estimation. In order to train our method, we have constructed a dataset of 1,458 images with separate annotations for cast and attached shadows, enabling training and quantitative evaluation of both. Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative geometry-illumination reasoning substantially improves the detection of attached shadows, with at least 33% BER reduction, while maintaining strong full and cast shadow performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u6295\u5c04\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u7c7b\u9634\u5f71\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6295\u5c04\u9634\u5f71\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5206\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u7c7b\u9634\u5f71\uff09\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4ece\u9634\u5f71\u63a8\u65ad\u5149\u65b9\u5411\uff09\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u5149\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u5411\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u9634\u5f71\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa1458\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4bBER\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u5c1133%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6295\u5c04\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u534f\u540c\u95ed\u73af\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9644\u7740\u9634\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u9634\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u7269\u7406\u6210\u56e0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Although clinical notes contain rich, detailed patient information and make up a large portion of electronic health records (EHRs), they remain underutilized for HF readmission risk analysis. Traditional computational models for HF readmission often rely on expert-crafted rules, medical thesauri, and ontologies to interpret clinical notes, which are typically written under time pressure and may contain misspellings, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon. We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk.

However, their infinite-dimensional backbone deformation, unmodeled internal friction, and configuration-dependent stiffness fundamentally limit the reliability of model-based kinematic formulations, resulting in inaccurate Jacobian predictions, artificial singularities, and unstable actuation behavior. Motivated by these limitations, this work presents a complete model-less control framework that bypasses kinematic modeling by using an empirically initialized Jacobian refined online through differential convex updates. Tip motion is generated via a real-time quadratic program that computes actuator increments while enforcing tendon slack avoidance and geometric limits. A backbone tension optimization term is introduced in this paper to regulate axial loading and suppress co-activation compression. The framework is validated across circular, pentagonal, and square trajectories, demonstrating smooth convergence, stable tension evolution, and sub-millimeter steady-state accuracy without any model calibration or parameter identification. These results establish the proposed controller as a scalable alternative to model-dependent continuum manipulation in a constrained environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u5e76\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u5b9e\u73b0\u672b\u7aef\u7cbe\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u80cc\u9aa8\u5f20\u529b\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u5171\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0b\u7684\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7a33\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u5185\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u6784\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u521a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u3001\u865a\u5047\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u53ca\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5206\u51f8\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u7ebf\u7cbe\u5316\uff1b\u672b\u7aef\u8fd0\u52a8\u7531\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u89e3\u6267\u884c\u5668\u589e\u91cf\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u5305\u62ec\u808c\u8171\u677e\u5f1b\u907f\u514d\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u65b0\u589e\u80cc\u9aa8\u5f20\u529b\u4f18\u5316\u9879\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7\u8f74\u5411\u8f7d\u8377\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5171\u6fc0\u6d3b\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5706\u5f62\u3001\u4e94\u8fb9\u5f62\u548c\u65b9\u5f62\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u6536\u655b\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f20\u529b\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u4e9a\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7a33\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u8fa8\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e3a\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u578b\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u64cd\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

LLM4SFC is based on three components: (i) A reduced structured representation that captures essential topology and in-line ST and reduced textual verbosity; (ii) Fine-tuning and few-shot retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for alignment with SFC programming conventions; and (iii) A structured generation approach that prunes illegal tokens in real-time to ensure compliance with the textual format of SFCs. We evaluate LLM4SFC on a dataset of real-world SFCs from automated manufacturing projects, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs. The results show that LLM4SFC reliably generates syntactically valid SFC programs effectively bridging graphical and textual PLC languages, achieving a generation generation success of 75% - 94%, paving the way for automated industrial programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LLM4SFC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u529f\u80fd\u56fe\uff08SFC\uff09\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u975e\u6cd5token\u526a\u679d\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SFC\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u591a\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u578bPLC\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982ST\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u56fe\u5f62\u5316IEC 61131-3\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982SFC\uff09\u56e0\u542b\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fST\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ca\u56fe\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u6807\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u3001\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u5de5\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLM4SFC\u4e09\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(i) \u7b80\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6355\u83b7SFC\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u5185\u8054ST\uff1b(ii) \u9488\u5bf9SFC\u7f16\u7a0b\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u5c11\u6837\u672cRAG\uff1b(iii) \u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u526a\u679d\u975e\u6cd5token\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969cSFC\u6587\u672c\u683c\u5f0f\u5408\u89c4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5236\u9020\u9879\u76eeSFC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cLLM4SFC\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u5546\u7528LLM\u5747\u5b9e\u73b075%\u201394%\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884cSFC\u751f\u6210\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u56fe\u5f62/\u6587\u672c\uff09\u6865\u63a5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM4SFC\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884cSFC\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Revisiting the \"fooling images\" work introduced by Nguyen et al. (2015), we re-implement both CPPN-based and direct-encoding-based evolutionary fooling attacks on modern architectures, including convolutional and transformer classifiers. Our re-implementation confirm that high-confidence fooling persists even in state-of-the-art networks, with transformer-based ViT-B/16 emerging as the most susceptible--achieving near-certain misclassifications with substantially fewer queries than convolution-based models. We then introduce SPOOF, a minimalist, consistent, and more efficient black-box attack generating high-confidence fooling images. Despite its simplicity, SPOOF generates unrecognizable fooling images with minimal pixel modifications and drastically reduced compute. Furthermore, retraining with fooling images as an additional class provides only partial resistance, as SPOOF continues to fool consistently with slightly higher query budgets--highlighting persistent fragility of modern deep classifiers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Nguyen\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u5f0f\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5377\u79ef\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6b3a\u9a97\u73b0\u8c61\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5SPOOF\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee5\u6781\u5c11\u50cf\u7d20\u4fee\u6539\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u4e9f\u9700\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eCPPN\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u5f0f\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3CNN\u548cViT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSPOOF\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ViT-B/16\uff09\u6bd4CNN\u66f4\u6613\u53d7\u6b3a\u9a97\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff1bSPOOF\u80fd\u4ee5\u6781\u5c0f\u50cf\u7d20\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6b3a\u9a97\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u90e8\u5206\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cSPOOF\u4ecd\u53ef\u5728\u7a0d\u589e\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u6210\u529f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SPOOF\uff09\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5c42\u9762\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u3002"}}

They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention. In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan. This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVIGIL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u7701\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u7ef4\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u6790\u3001\u60c5\u7eea\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u3001EmoBank\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0eRBT\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5144\u5f1f\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u6545\u969c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Agentic LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u81ea\u7701\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bca\u65ad\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6613\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u8106\u5f31\u7684LLM\u8c03\u7528\u94fe\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7ef4\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVIGIL\u53cd\u5c04\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff1a1\uff09\u6444\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u65e5\u5fd7\u5e76\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u60c5\u7eea\u8868\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u7ef4\u62a4\u5e26\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u5316EmoBank\uff1b3\uff09\u751f\u6210RBT\u8bca\u65ad\uff08\u4f18\u52bf/\u673a\u4f1a/\u5931\u8d25\uff09\uff1b4\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u8f93\u51fa\u53d7\u63a7\u63d0\u793a\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u53ea\u8bfb\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u590d\u5efa\u8bae\uff1b5\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u95e8\u63a7\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u9632\u6b62\u975e\u6cd5\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63d0\u9192\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cVIGIL\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u590d\uff1b\u5f53\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u56e0schema\u51b2\u7a81\u5931\u6548\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u66b4\u9732\u5185\u90e8\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u542f\u7528\u964d\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u590d\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5143\u5c42\u7ea7\u81ea\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "VIGIL\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c06\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u4e0e\u53d7\u63a7\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6f14\u5316\u7684Agentic\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This work proposes a multimodal graph neural network framework that integrates structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI to model spatiotemporal brain network reorganization. Brain regions are represented as nodes and structural and functional connectivity as edges, forming longitudinal brain graphs for each subject. Temporal evolution is captured via fractional stochastic differential operators embedded within graph-based recurrent networks, enabling the modeling of long-term dependencies and stochastic fluctuations in network dynamics. Attention mechanisms fuse multimodal information and generate interpretable biomarkers, including network energy entropy, graph curvature, fractional memory indices, and modality-specific attention scores. These biomarkers are combined into a composite prognostic index to quantify individual risk of network instability or cognitive decline.

Our results show that proprietary models, particularly Gemini with one-shot prompting, outperformed others, producing summaries with the highest similarity to the gold-standard ones. Open-source models, while promising, especially Mistral after fine-tuning, lagged in performance, often struggling with hallucinations and repeated information.

Color evolution of food samples is an important indicator of product quality in food drying. Although existing studies have examined color changes under different drying conditions, current approaches primarily rely on low-dimensional color features and cannot fully capture the complex, dynamic color trajectories of food samples. Moreover, existing modeling approaches lack the ability to generalize to unseen process conditions. To address these limitations, we develop a novel multi-modal color-trajectory prediction method that integrates high-dimensional temporal color information with drying process parameters to enable accurate and data-efficient color trajectory prediction. Under unseen drying conditions, the model attains RMSEs of 2.12 for cookie drying and 1.29 for apple drying, reducing errors by over 90% compared with baseline models.

We prove the taxonomy's visual coherence by training a CNN on raw grid pixels (95.24% accuracy on S3, 36.25% overall, 3.3x chance), then apply the taxonomy diagnostically to the original ARC-AGI-2 test set. Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve >80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but <10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum. Applying our framework to Li et al.'s independent ViTARC study (400 specialists, 1M examples each) confirms its predictive power: Very Low affinity tasks achieve 51.9% versus 77.7% for High affinity (p<0.001), with a task at 0% despite massive data. The taxonomy enables precise diagnosis: low-affinity tasks (A2) hit hard ceilings, while high-affinity tasks (C1) reach 99.8%.

Current practice to solve the above problem via UV lighting or virtual transfer using learning-based models introduces hardware complexity or computing burdens. This paper introduces MagicSkin, a novel tactile skin with translucent, tinted markers balancing the modes of marker and markerless for VBTS. It enables simultaneous tangential displacement tracking, force prediction, and surface detail preservation. This skin is easy to plug into GelSight-family sensors without requiring additional hardware or software tools. We comprehensively evaluate MagicSkin in downstream tasks. The translucent markers impressively enhance rather than degrade sensing performance compared with traditional markerless and inked marker design: it achieves best performance in object classification (99.17\\%), texture classification (93.51\\%), tangential displacement tracking (97\\% point retention) and force prediction (66\\% improvement in total force error). These experimental results demonstrate that translucent skin eliminates the traditional performance trade-off in marker or markerless modes, paving the way for multimodal tactile sensing essential in tactile robotics.

Pre-MIT Press publication version", "summary": "Multimodal classifiers function as opaque black box models. While several techniques exist to interpret their predictions, very few of them are as intuitive and accessible as natural language explanations (NLEs). To build trust, such explanations must faithfully capture the classifier's internal decision making behavior, a property known as faithfulness. In this paper, we propose CAuSE (Causal Abstraction under Simulated Explanations), a novel framework to generate faithful NLEs for any pretrained multimodal classifier. We demonstrate that CAuSE generalizes across datasets and models through extensive empirical evaluations. Theoretically, we show that CAuSE, trained via interchange intervention, forms a causal abstraction of the underlying classifier.

Six participating teams were evaluated using a standardized FL setup and a multi-institutional dataset derived from the BraTS glioma benchmark, consisting of 1,251 training cases, 219 validation cases, and 570 hidden test cases with segmentations for enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). Teams were ranked using a cumulative scoring system that considered both segmentation performance, measured by Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and communication efficiency assessed through the convergence score. A PID-controller-based method achieved the top overall ranking, obtaining mean DSC values of 0.733, 0.761, and 0.751 for ET, TC, and WT, respectively, with corresponding HD95 values of 33.922 mm, 33.623 mm, and 32.309 mm, while also demonstrating the highest communication efficiency with a convergence score of 0.764. These findings advance the state of federated learning for medical imaging, surpassing top-performing methods from previous challenge iterations and highlighting PID controllers as effective mechanisms for stabilizing and optimizing weight aggregation in FL.

Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models. While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective. We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users. The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs.

The standard objective used in reward modeling is the Bradley-Terry (BT) loss, which learns from pairwise data consisting of a pair of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we analyze the per-sample gradient of BT-loss and show that its norm scales with two distinct components: (1) the difference in predicted rewards between chosen and rejected responses, which reflects the prediction error, and critically, (2) representation distance between the pair measured in the output space of the final layer. While the first term captures the intended training signal, we show that the second term can significantly impact the update magnitude and misalign learning. Specifically, pairs with small representation distance often receive vanishingly weak updates, even when misranked, while pairs with large distance receive disproportionately strong updates. This leads to gradients from large-distance pairs to overshadow those from small-distance pairs, where fine-grained distinctions are especially important. To overcome this limitation, we propose NormBT, an adaptive pair-wise normalization scheme that balances representation-driven effects and focuses learning signals on prediction error. NormBT is a lightweight, drop-in integration to BT loss with negligible overhead. Across various LLM backbones and datasets, NormBT improves reward model performance consistently, with notable gains of over 5% on the Reasoning category of RewardBench, which contains numerous small-distance pairs.

Microscopic imaging provides organism level visibility, whereas physicochemical sensors reveal shortterm changes in water chemistry; in practice, operators must interpret these streams separately, making realtime decision-making unreliable. This study introduces AquaFusionNet, a lightweight cross-modal framework that unifies both information sources inside a single edge deployable model. Unlike prior work that treats microscopic detection and water quality prediction as independent tasks, AquaFusionNet learns the statistical dependencies between microbial appearance and concurrent sensor dynamics through a gated crossattention mechanism designed specifically for lowpower hardware. The framework is trained on AquaMicro12K, a new dataset comprising 12,846 annotated 1000 micrographs curated for drinking water contexts, an area where publicly accessible microscopic datasets are scarce. Deployed for six months across seven facilities in East Java, Indonesia, the system processed 1.84 million frames and consistently detected contamination events with 94.8% mAP@0.5 and 96.3% anomaly prediction accuracy, while operating at 4.8 W on a Jetson Nano. Comparative experiments against representative lightweight detectors show that AquaFusionNet provides higher accuracy at comparable or lower power, and field results indicate that cross-modal coupling reduces common failure modes of unimodal detectors, particularly under fouling, turbidity spikes, and inconsistent illumination.

Preparing submission for EDM 2026 conference", "summary": "With the recent surge in personalized learning, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) that can accurately track students' individual knowledge states and provide tailored learning paths based on this information are in demand as an essential task. This paper focuses on the core technology of Knowledge Tracing (KT) models that analyze students' sequences of interactions to predict their knowledge acquisition levels. However, existing KT models suffer from limitations such as restricted input data formats, cold start problems arising with new student enrollment or new question addition, and insufficient stability in real-world service environments. To overcome these limitations, a Practical Interlinked Concept Knowledge Tracing (PICKT) model that can effectively process multiple types of input data is proposed. Specifically, a knowledge map structures the relationships among concepts considering the question and concept text information, thereby enabling effective knowledge tracing even in cold start situations. Experiments reflecting real operational environments demonstrated the model's excellent performance and practicality. The main contributions of this research are as follows. First, a model architecture that effectively utilizes diverse data formats is presented.

Understanding the high generalization ability of large-scale models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) remains one of the central open problems in machine learning theory. While recent theoretical studies have attributed this phenomenon to the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) toward well-generalizing solutions, empirical evidences indicate that it primarily stems from properties of the model itself. Specifically, even randomly sampled interpolators, which are parameters that achieve zero training error, have been observed to generalize effectively. In this study, under a teacher-student framework, we prove that the generalization error of randomly sampled interpolators becomes exactly zero once the number of training samples exceeds a threshold determined by the geometric structure of the interpolator set in parameter space.

We define this phenomenon as cumulative contextual decay - a progressive degradation of contextual integrity caused by attention pollution, dilution, and drift. To address this challenge, we propose Rhea (Role-aware Heuristic Episodic Attention), a novel framework that decouples conversation history into two functionally independent memory modules: (1) an Instructional Memory (IM) that persistently stores high-fidelity global constraints via a structural priority mechanism, and (2) an Episodic Memory (EM) that dynamically manages user-model interactions via asymmetric noise control and heuristic context retrieval. During inference, Rhea constructs a high signal-to-noise context by applying its priority attention: selectively integrating relevant episodic information while always prioritizing global instructions. To validate this approach, experiments on multiple multi-turn conversation benchmarks - including MT-Eval and Long-MT-Bench+ - show that Rhea mitigates performance decay and improves overall accuracy by 1.04 points on a 10-point scale (a 16% relative gain over strong baselines). Moreover, Rhea maintains near-perfect instruction fidelity (IAR > 8.1) across long-horizon interactions.

Of particular interest are labeled random finite set methods that maintain temporally coherent labels for each object. While these methods enjoy important theoretical properties as closed-form solutions to the multi-target Bayes filter, the maintenance of multiple hypotheses under the standard measurement model is highly computationally expensive, even when hypothesis pruning approximations are applied. In this work, we focus on the Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter as an example of this class of methods. We investigate a variant of the filter that allows multiple detections per object from the same sensor, a critical capability when deploying tracking in the context of distributed networks of machine learning-based virtual sensors. We show that this breaks the inter-detection dependencies in the filter updates of the standard GLMB filter, allowing updates with significantly improved parallel scalability and enabling efficient deployment on GPU hardware.

However, existing approaches typically treat observations as high-level conditioning inputs to the denoising network, rather than integrating them into the stochastic dynamics of the diffusion process itself. As a result, sampling must begin from random Gaussian noise, weakening the coupling between perception and control and often yielding suboptimal performance. We introduce BridgePolicy, a generative visuomotor policy that explicitly embeds observations within the stochastic differential equation via a diffusion-bridge formulation. By constructing an observation-informed trajectory, BridgePolicy enables sampling to start from a rich, informative prior rather than random noise, substantially improving precision and reliability in control. A key challenge is that classical diffusion bridges connect distributions with matched dimensionality, whereas robotic observations are heterogeneous and multi-modal and do not naturally align with the action space. To address this, we design a multi-modal fusion module and a semantic aligner that unify visual and state inputs and align observation and action representations, making the bridge applicable to heterogeneous robot data. Extensive experiments across 52 simulation tasks on three benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate that BridgePolicy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBridgePolicy\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6865\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u51fa\u53d1\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u572852\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u548c5\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u672a\u5c06\u5176\u878d\u5165\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\u9700\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBridgePolicy\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6865\uff08diffusion-bridge\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u5d4c\u5165\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6/\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u517152\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca5\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cBridgePolicy\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u8fdb\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6865\u63a5\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This expressive embedding is then processed by a deep reinforcement learning policy network, which generates real-time scheduling decisions optimized for both makespan and carbon emission objectives. To support sustainability goals, \\textsc{Luca} incorporates a dual-objective reward function that encourages both energy efficiency and scheduling timeliness. Experimental results on both synthetic and public datasets demonstrate that \\textsc{Luca} consistently outperforms comparison algorithms.

While powered ankle-foot prostheses have demonstrated adaptability across speeds and rigid terrains, control strategies optimized for soft or compliant surfaces remain underexplored. This work experimentally validates an admittance-based control strategy that dynamically adjusts the quasi-stiffness of powered prostheses to enhance gait stability on compliant ground. Human subject experiments were conducted with three healthy individuals walking on two bilaterally compliant surfaces with ground stiffness values of 63 and 25 kN/m, representative of real-world soft environments. Controller performance was quantified using phase portraits and two walking stability metrics, offering a direct assessment of fall risk. Compared to a standard phase-variable controller developed for rigid terrain, the proposed admittance controller consistently improved gait stability across all compliant conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of adaptive, stability-aware prosthesis control to reduce fall risk in real-world environments and advance the robustness of human-prosthesis interaction in rehabilitation robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bfc\u7eb3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u80a2\u5047\u80a2\u5728\u67d4\u8f6f\u5730\u9762\uff08\u598263\u548c25 kN/m\u521a\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u8d70\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u76f8\u53d8\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u80a2\u622a\u80a2\u8005\u5728\u67d4\u8f6f\u6216\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5730\u9762\u4e0a\u884c\u8d70\u65f6\u8dcc\u5012\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u529b\u8e1d\u8db3\u5047\u80a2\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u521a\u6027\u5730\u9762\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8f6f\u5730\u9762\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bfc\u7eb3\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u5047\u80a2\u51c6\u521a\u5ea6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u521a\u5ea6\u7684\u53cc\u4fa7\u67d4\u8f6f\u5730\u9762\u4e0a\u884c\u8d70\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u56fe\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u6b65\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u67d4\u8f6f\u5730\u9762\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u5bfc\u7eb3\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5747\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u76f8\u53d8\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6b65\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8dcc\u5012\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u671b\u964d\u4f4e\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u622a\u80a2\u8005\u7684\u8dcc\u5012\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba-\u5047\u80a2\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Yet LLMs, especially trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), are known to exhibit biases toward dominant viewpoints, raising concerns about their ability to represent users from diverse demographic and cultural backgrounds. In this work, we examine the extent to which LLMs can simulate human responses to cross-domain survey questions through direct prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. We further propose a claim diversification method CLAIMSIM, which elicits viewpoints from LLM parametric knowledge as contextual input. Experiments on the survey question answering task indicate that, while CLAIMSIM produces more diverse responses, both approaches struggle to accurately simulate users. Further analysis reveals two key limitations: (1) LLMs tend to maintain fixed viewpoints across varying demographic features, and generate single-perspective claims; and (2) when presented with conflicting claims, LLMs struggle to reason over nuanced differences among demographic features, limiting their ability to adapt responses to specific user profiles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u80cc\u666f\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8c03\u67e5\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u65f6\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCLAIMSIM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u89c2\u70b9\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9002\u914d\u7528\u6237\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ecfRLHF\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5411\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u80cc\u666f\u7528\u6237\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u8c03\u67e5\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faCLAIMSIM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e3b\u5f20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "CLAIMSIM\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e24\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1aLLMs\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff08\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u4e3b\u5f20\u95f4\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u53e3\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5f02\u8d28\u7528\u6237\u610f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u53e3\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c2\u70b9\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Gureckis", "Mengye Ren"], "title": "Opinion: Learning Intuitive Physics May Require More than Visual Data", "comment": null, "summary": "Humans expertly navigate the world by building rich internal models founded on an intuitive understanding of physics. Meanwhile, despite training on vast quantities of internet video data, state-of-the-art deep learning models still fall short of human-level performance on intuitive physics benchmarks. This work investigates whether data distribution, rather than volume, is the key to learning these principles. We pretrain a Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) model on SAYCam, a developmentally realistic, egocentric video dataset partially capturing three children's everyday visual experiences.

By building knowledge graphs (KGs), the product matching problem can be converted to the Entity Alignment (EA) task, which aims to discover the equivalent entities from diverse KGs. The existing EA methods inadequately utilize both attribute triples and relation triples simultaneously, especially the interactions between them. This paper introduces a two-stage pipeline consisting of rough filter and fine filter to match products from eBay and Amazon. For fine filtering, a new framework for Entity Alignment, Relation-aware and Attribute-aware Graph Attention Networks for Entity Alignment (RAEA), is employed. RAEA focuses on the interactions between attribute triples and relation triples, where the entity representation aggregates the alignment signals from attributes and relations with Attribute-aware Entity Encoder and Relation-aware Graph Attention Networks. The experimental results indicate that the RAEA model achieves significant improvements over 12 baselines on EA task in the cross-lingual dataset DBP15K (6.59% on average Hits@1) and delivers competitive results in the monolingual dataset DWY100K.

Feature propagation (FP) is a well-known method that performs well for imputation of missing node features on graphs, but it still has the following three issues: 1) it struggles with graphs that are not fully connected, 2) imputed features face the over-smoothing problem, and 3) FP is tailored for transductive tasks, overlooking the feature distribution shift in inductive tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce DDFI, a Diverse and Distribution-aware Missing Feature Imputation method that combines feature propagation with a graph-based Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) in a nontrivial manner. It first designs a simple yet effective algorithm, namely Co-Label Linking (CLL), that randomly connects nodes in the training set with the same label to enhance the performance on graphs with numerous connected components. Then we develop a novel two-step representation generation process at the inference stage. Specifically, instead of directly using FP-imputed features as input during inference, DDFI further reconstructs the features through the whole MAE to reduce feature distribution shift in the inductive tasks and enhance the diversity of node features. Meanwhile, since existing feature imputation methods for graphs only evaluate by simulating the missing scenes with manually masking the features, we collect a new dataset called Sailing from the records of voyages that contains naturally missing features to help better evaluate the effectiveness. Extensive experiments conducted on six public datasets and Sailing show that DDFI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under both transductive and inductive settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDDFI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\uff08FP\uff09\u4e0e\u56fe\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08MAE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Co-Label Linking\u589e\u5f3a\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3001\u4e24\u6b65\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u7684GNN\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u5b9e\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u96c6Sailing\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u5e38\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff08\u5982\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c5e\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GNN\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5FP\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u975e\u8fde\u901a\u56fe\u3001\u5f15\u53d1\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u4e14\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6c\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5f52\u7eb3\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDDFI\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u7279\u5f81\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1Co-Label Linking\uff08CLL\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8282\u70b9\u968f\u673a\u52a0\u8fb9\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5f31\u8fde\u901a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\uff1a\u5148\u7528FP\u7c97\u7565\u586b\u8865\uff0c\u518d\u7ecf\u56feMAE\u6574\u4f53\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u96c6Sailing\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDDFI\u5728\u8f6c\u5bfc\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DDFI\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfFP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u4e0d\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3001\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Ten healthy participants walked on a custom split-belt treadmill. All participants received real-time visual feedback of their ground reaction forces. One group also experienced changes in ground compliance, while a control group received only visual feedback. Intentional increases in propulsive ground reaction forces (POF) were successfully achieved and sustained post-intervention, especially in the group that experienced ground compliance. This group also demonstrated lasting after-effects in muscle activity and joint kinematics, indicating a more robust learning of natural strategies to increase propulsion. This work demonstrates how visual and proprioceptive systems coordinate during gait adaptation.

It comprises a large library drawn from the CTCAE vocabulary, and item selection for a given trial is typically guided by expected toxicity profiles from prior data. Selecting too many PRO-CTCAE items can burden patients and reduce compliance, while too few may miss important safety signals. We present an automated method to select a minimal yet comprehensive PRO-CTCAE subset based on historical safety data. Each candidate PRO-CTCAE symptom term is first mapped to its corresponding MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs), which are then encoded into Safeterm, a high-dimensional semantic space capturing clinical and contextual diversity in MedDRA terminology. We score each candidate PRO item for relevance to the historical list of adverse event PTs and combine relevance and incidence into a utility function. Spectral analysis is then applied to the combined utility and diversity matrix to identify an orthogonal set of medical concepts that balances relevance and diversity. Symptoms are rank-ordered by importance, and a cut-off is suggested based on the explained information. The tool is implemented as part of the Safeterm trial-safety app. We evaluate its performance using simulations and oncology case studies in which PRO-CTCAE was employed.

Existing approaches, however, have largely focused on the simpler setting of homogeneous, dense prediction tasks, leaving the more realistic challenge of learning from structurally diverse tasks unexplored. To this end, we introduce NexusFlow, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play framework effective in both settings. NexusFlow introduces a set of surrogate networks with invertible coupling layers to align the latent feature distributions of tasks, creating a unified representation that enables effective knowledge transfer. The coupling layers are bijective, preserving information while mapping features into a shared canonical space. This invertibility avoids representational collapse and enables alignment across structurally different tasks without reducing expressive capacity. We first evaluate NexusFlow on the core challenge of domain-partitioned autonomous driving, where dense map reconstruction and sparse multi-object tracking are supervised in different geographic regions, creating both structural disparity and a strong domain gap. NexusFlow sets a new state-of-the-art result on nuScenes, outperforming strong partially supervised baselines. To demonstrate generality, we further test NexusFlow on NYUv2 using three homogeneous dense prediction tasks, segmentation, depth, and surface normals, as a representative N-task PS-MTL scenario.

This study proposes Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal AutoRegression (M-STAR), a new framework that generates long-term trajectories through a coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal prediction process. M-STAR combines a Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenizer that encodes hierarchical mobility patterns with a Transformer-based decoder for next-scale autoregressive prediction.

Artificial intelligence techniques, which use a neural network component in various forms, have recently frequently been used to accomplish this step. However, the complexity of the neural network structure still stands up as a critical problem against prediction accuracy. In this paper, a method inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control approach is investigated to enhance the performance of neural network models used for multi-step ahead prediction of periodic time-series information while maintaining a negligible impact on the complexity of the system. The PID-based method is applied to the predicted value at each time step to bring that value closer to the real value. The water demand forecasting problem is considered as a case study, where two deep neural network models from the literature are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed boosting method. Furthermore, to prove the applicability of this PID-based booster to other types of periodic time-series prediction problems, it is applied to enhance the accuracy of a neural network model used for multi-step forecasting of hourly energy consumption.

We present an end to end reinforcement learning framework based on Soft Actor Critic that learns flow-aware navigation policies using only local velocity measurements. Through extensive evaluation across diverse and dynamically rich scenarios, our method demonstrates substantial energy savings and robust generalization to previously unseen flow conditions, offering a promising path toward long term autonomy in ocean environments.

They serve as powerful analytical tools enabling scalable corpus analysis and embedding-based authorship attribution, while simultaneously destabilising foundational assumptions about idiolect through style mimicry, authorship obfuscation, and the proliferation of synthetic texts. Recent stylometric research indicates that LLMs can approximate surface stylistic features yet exhibit detectable differences from human writers, a tension with significant forensic implications. However, current AI-text detection techniques, whether classifier-based, stylometric, or watermarking approaches, face substantial limitations: high false positive rates for non-native English writers and vulnerability to adversarial strategies such as homoglyph substitution. These uncertainties raise concerns under legal admissibility standards, particularly the Daubert and Kumho Tire frameworks. The article concludes that forensic linguistics requires methodological reconfiguration to remain scientifically credible and legally admissible. Proposed adaptations include hybrid human-AI workflows, explainable detection paradigms beyond binary classification, and validation regimes measuring error and bias across diverse populations.

While effective on seen classes, such supervision overlooks the rich semantics encoded in category names, hindering the modeling of comparability among cross-category details and, in turn, limiting generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we introduce LaFG, a Language-driven framework for Fine-Grained Retrieval that converts class names into attribute-level supervision using large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Treating each name as a semantic anchor, LaFG prompts an LLM to generate detailed, attribute-oriented descriptions.

While CBMs use supervision to align activations with human-labeled concepts, SAEs rely on sparse coding to uncover emergent ones. We show that both paradigms instantiate the same geometric structure: each learns a set of linear directions in activation space whose nonnegative combinations form a concept cone. Supervised and unsupervised methods thus differ not in kind but in how they select this cone. Building on this view, we propose an operational bridge between the two paradigms. CBMs provide human-defined reference geometries, while SAEs can be evaluated by how well their learned cones approximate or contain those of CBMs. This containment framework yields quantitative metrics linking inductive biases -- such as SAE type, sparsity, or expansion ratio -- to emergence of plausible\\footnote{We adopt the terminology of \\citet{jacovi2020towards}, who distinguish between faithful explanations (accurately reflecting model computations) and plausible explanations (aligning with human intuition and domain knowledge).

Using these metrics, we uncover a ``sweet spot'' in both sparsity and expansion factor that maximizes both geometric and semantic alignment with CBM concepts.

Solving these problems under various constraints not only recovers a wide range of popular optimizers as closed-form solutions, but also produces the optimal hyperparameters of these optimizers with respect to the problems at hand.

While IDA-PBC has been extensively studied and applied to many systems, its practical implementation often remains confined to academic examples and, almost exclusively, to stabilization tasks. The main limitation of IDA-PBC stems from the complexity of analytically solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs), referred to as the matching conditions, which enforce the pH structure of the closed-loop system. However, this is extremely challenging, especially for complex physical systems and tasks.\n  In this work, we propose a novel numerical approach for designing IDA-PBC controllers without solving the matching PDEs exactly. We cast the IDA-PBC problem as the learning of a neural ordinary differential equation. In particular, we rely on sparse dictionary learning to parametrize the desired closed-loop system as a sparse linear combination of nonlinear state-dependent functions. Optimization of the controller parameters is achieved by solving a multi-objective optimization problem whose cost function is composed of a generic task-dependent cost and a matching condition-dependent cost. Our numerical results show that the proposed method enables (i) IDA-PBC to be applicable to complex tasks beyond stabilization, such as the discovery of periodic oscillatory behaviors, (ii) the derivation of closed-form expressions of the controlled system, including residual terms", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1IDA-PBC\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u89e3\u6790\u6c42\u89e3\u5339\u914dPDEs\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u62d3\u5c55\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5bfc\u51fa\u542b\u6b8b\u5dee\u9879\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfIDA-PBC\u56e0\u9700\u89e3\u6790\u6c42\u89e3\u5339\u914d\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDEs\uff09\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06IDA-PBC\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff08\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u542b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u9879\u4e0e\u5339\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u9879\uff09\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86IDA-PBC\u5728\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5bfc\u51fa\u542b\u6b8b\u5dee\u9879\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u503c\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86IDA-PBC\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

The core issue is not a lack of knowledge, but a path selection bias within the vast reasoning search space. Although LVLMs are often capable of sampling correct solution trajectories, they disproportionately favor unstable or logically inconsistent ones, leading to erratic and unreliable outcomes. The substantial disparity between Pass@K (with large K) and Pass@1 across numerous models provides compelling evidence that such failures primarily stem from misreasoning rather than ignorance. To systematically investigate and address this issue, we propose PSO (Path-Select Optimization), a two-stage post-training framework designed to enhance both the reasoning performance and stability of existing LVLMs. In the first stage, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with template and answer-based rewards to cultivate structured, step-by-step reasoning. In the second stage, we conduct online preference optimization, where the model samples reasoning paths from GRPO-generated data, self-evaluates them, and aligns itself toward the preferred trajectories. Incorrect or suboptimal paths are concurrently stored in a Negative Replay Memory (NRM) as hard negatives, which are periodically revisited to prevent the model from repeating prior mistakes and to facilitate continual reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments show that PSO effectively prunes invalid reasoning paths, substantially enhances reasoning accuracy (with 7.4% improvements on average), and yields more stable and consistent chains of thought.

However, most studies focus on general information retrieval and rarely explores vertical domains with unique challenges. In this work, we focus on local life services and introduce LocalSearchBench, which encompass diverse and complex business scenarios. Real-world queries in this domain are often ambiguous and require multi-hop reasoning across merchants and products, remaining challenging and not fully addressed. As the first comprehensive benchmark for agentic search in local life services, LocalSearchBench includes over 150,000 high-quality entries from various cities and business types. We construct 300 multi-hop QA tasks based on real user queries, challenging agents to understand questions and retrieve information in multiple steps. We also developed LocalPlayground, a unified environment integrating multiple tools for agent interaction. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art LRMs struggle on LocalSearchBench: the best model (DeepSeek-V3.1) achieves only 34.34% correctness, and most models have issues with completeness (average 77.33%) and faithfulness (average 61.99%). This highlights the need for specialized benchmarks and domain-specific agent training in local life services.

In this paper, we first investigate a recent length control method based on Reverse Positional Embeddings (RPE) and show its limits when control is requested beyond the training distribution. In particular, using a discrete countdown signal tied to the absolute remaining token count leads to instability. To provide robust length control, we introduce Progress Ratio Embeddings (PRE), as continuous embeddings tied to a trigonometric impatience signal.

However, building a 3D Gaussian is guided solely by photometric loss, which can result in inconsistencies in reconstruction. This under-constrained process often results in \"floater\" artifacts and unstructured geometry, preventing the extraction of high-fidelity surfaces. To address this issue, our paper introduces a novel method that improves reconstruction by enforcing global geometry consistency through constrained multi-view triangulation. Our approach aims to achieve a consensus on 3D representation in the physical world by utilizing various estimated views. We optimize this process by penalizing the deviation of a rendered 3D point from a robust consensus point, which is re-triangulated from a bundle of neighboring views in a self-supervised fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. On the DTU dataset, our method attains a mean Chamfer Distance of 0.50 mm, outperforming comparable explicit methods.

A Qualitative Analysis of Success and Failure Scenarios of Various LLMs in Agentic Simulations", "comment": "48 pages, 3 tables, 2 listings", "summary": "We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when operating as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities. Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7KAMI v0.1\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Granite 4 Small\u3001Llama 4 Maverick\u3001DeepSeek V3.1\uff09\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u975e\u51b3\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff09\u66f4\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u7c7b\u5171\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u951a\u5b9a\u3001\u6062\u590d\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\u6839\u6e90\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eKAMI v0.1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9900\u6761\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u3001CSV\u5206\u6790\u3001SQL\u56db\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u5f00\u5c55\u9010\u8bd5\u9a8c\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u7edf\u8ba1\u805a\u5408\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u51b3\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u5982400B\u7684Llama 4 Maverick\u4ec5\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e32B\u7684Granite 4 Small\uff09\uff1bDeepSeek V3.1\u7684\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u7c7b\u9ad8\u9891\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a5\u5730\u5373\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8865\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u66f4\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u2014\u2014\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5bf9\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u5173\u6ce8\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6062\u590d\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Conventional methods rely on computationally expensive while accurate numerical solvers, which are not scalable for large-scale or real-time applications. Although deep learning-based surrogate models can accelerate these computations, they often suffer from limitations such as fixed-resolution constraints or dependence on explicit partial differential equation formulations. These issues hinder their applicability and generalization across diverse environments. We propose Hankel-FNO, a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)-based model for efficient and accurate acoustic charting.

While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage large pre-trained understanding models for perception and instruction following, their ability to generalize to novel tasks, objects, and settings remains limited. In this work, we present VideoVLA, a simple approach that explores the potential of transforming large video generation models into robotic VLA manipulators. Given a language instruction and an image, VideoVLA predicts an action sequence as well as the future visual outcomes. Built on a multi-modal Diffusion Transformer, VideoVLA jointly models video, language, and action modalities, using pre-trained video generative models for joint visual and action forecasting. Our experiments show that high-quality imagined futures correlate with reliable action predictions and task success, highlighting the importance of visual imagination in manipulation. VideoVLA demonstrates strong generalization, including imitating other embodiments' skills and handling novel objects.

Additionally, we find that the Dynamic Sampling (DS) component in DAPO does not improve performance; in fact, the best overall results are achieved with DAPO when DS is disabled.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86PPO\u3001GRPO\u548cDAPO\u4e09\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Countdown Game\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5148\u5728Countdown Game\u4e0a\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884cRL\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u5e76\u5bf9GRPO\u3001DAPO\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982group size\u3001KL-penalty\u7cfb\u6570\u3001Dynamic Sampling\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5e94\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u589e\u5927GRPO/DAPO\u7684group size\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1bKL-penalty\u7cfb\u6570\u5f71\u54cd\u5448\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff1bDAPO\u4e2dDynamic Sampling\u7ec4\u4ef6\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7981\u7528\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u6743\u8861\uff1bDAPO\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5173\u95edDS\uff09\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3aRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Yet, the impact of initialisation parameters still lacks a precise theoretical understanding for several well-established architectures. Here, we propose a new initialisation for networks with sinusoidal activation functions such as \\texttt{SIREN}, focusing on gradients control, their scaling with network depth, their impact on training and on generalization. To achieve this, we identify a closed-form expression for the initialisation of the parameters, differing from the original \\texttt{SIREN} scheme. This expression is derived from fixed points obtained through the convergence of pre-activation distribution and the variance of Jacobian sequences. Controlling both gradients and targeting vanishing pre-activation helps preventing the emergence of inappropriate frequencies during estimation, thereby improving generalization. We further show that this initialisation strongly influences training dynamics through the Neural Tangent Kernel framework (NTK). Finally, we benchmark \\texttt{SIREN} with the proposed initialisation against the original scheme and other baselines on function fitting and image reconstruction.

Achieving high fidelity in such systems requires balancing performance trade-off among workspace, dexterity, stiffness, inertia, and bandwidth, particularly in applications demanding pure rotational motion. This paper presents the design methodology and kinematic analysis of a Cable-Driven Coaxial Spherical Parallel Mechanism (CDC-SPM) developed to address these challenges. The proposed cable-driven interface design allows for reducing the mass placed at the robot arm end-effector, thereby minimizing inertial loads, enhancing stiffness, and improving dynamic responsiveness. Through parallel and coaxial actuation, the mechanism achieves decoupled rotational degrees of freedom with isotropic force and torque transmission. Simulation and analysis demonstrate that the CDC-SPM provides accurate, responsive, and safe motion characteristics suitable for high-precision haptic applications.

Existing REC benchmarks primarily evaluate perceptual capabilities and lack interpretable scoring mechanisms, which cannot reveal the grounding capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) across different cognitive abilities. To address this limitation, we introduce RefBench-PRO, a comprehensive REC benchmark, which decomposes referring expressions into two core dimensions, i.e., perception and reasoning, and further subdivides them into six progressively challenging tasks, such as attribute, position, interaction, commonsense, relation and reject.

We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints.

We prove that $\\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies. The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \\", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff08ACP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6210\u672cCeff\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eACP\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u5408\u7406\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u603b\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42Itotal\u3001\u6bcf\u6b65\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u91cfIstep\u53ca\u5355\u6b65\u6210\u672cCstep\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6210\u672cCeff = (Itotal/Istep) * Cstep\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eCeff\u662f\u671f\u671b\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u7d27\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1ACP\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5fc3\u548c\u968f\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "ACP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce a novel criterion for model compression, named \"Expressiveness\". Unlike existing pruning methods that rely on the inherent \"Importance\" of neurons' and filters' weights, ``Expressiveness\" emphasizes a neuron's or group of neurons ability to redistribute informational resources effectively, based on the overlap of activations. This characteristic is strongly correlated to a network's initialization state, establishing criterion autonomy from the learning state stateless and thus setting a new fundamental basis for the expansion of compression strategies in regards to the \"When to Prune\" question. We show that expressiveness is effectively approximated with arbitrary data or limited dataset's representative samples, making ground for the exploration of Data-Agnostic strategies. Our work also facilitates a \"hybrid\" formulation of expressiveness and importance-based pruning strategies, illustrating their complementary benefits and delivering up to 10x extra gains w.r.t. weight-based approaches in parameter compression ratios, with an average of 1% in performance degradation. We also show that employing expressiveness (independently) for pruning leads to an improvement over top-performing and foundational methods in terms of compression efficiency.

The method encodes joint angles via population place coding and converts skin-measured forces into spike-rate features using an Izhikevich neuron model; both signals are transformed into bipolar binary vectors and bound element-wise to create associations stored in a large-capacity sequential memory. To improve separability in binary space and inject geometry from touch, we introduce 3D rotary positional embeddings that rotate subspaces as a function of sensed force direction, enabling fuzzy retrieval through a softmax weighted recall over temporally shifted action patterns. On a Toyota Human Support Robot covered by robot skin, the hetero-associative sequential memory system realizes a pseudocompliance controller that moves the link under touch in the direction and with speed correlating to the amplitude of applied force, and it retrieves multi-joint grasp sequences by continuing tactile input. The system sets up quickly, trains from synchronized streams of states and observations, and exhibits a degree of generalization while remaining economical. Results demonstrate single-joint and full-arm behaviors executed via associative recall, and suggest extensions to imitation learning, motion planning, and multi-modal integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u5f02\u8054\u60f3\u5e8f\u5217\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u7ed1\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u9ad8\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u4ece\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u591a\u5173\u8282\u6293\u53d6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u52a8\u4f5c\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7fa4\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u8868\u5f81\u5173\u8282\u89d2\uff0cIzhikevich\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u89e6\u89c9\u529b\u8f6c\u4e3a\u8109\u51b2\u7387\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u4e8c\u8005\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u53cc\u6781\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff1b\u5f15\u51653D\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e8c\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u5e76\u878d\u5165\u89e6\u89c9\u65b9\u5411\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7softmax\u52a0\u6743\u65f6\u5e8f\u504f\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u7cca\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e30\u7530HSR\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f2a\u5408\u89c4\u63a7\u5236\uff08\u89e6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u968f\u529b\u5e45\u503c\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u53ca\u591a\u5173\u8282\u6293\u53d6\u5e8f\u5217\u7eed\u63a8\uff1b\u5355\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u652f\u6301\u540c\u6b65\u6d41\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5f02\u8054\u60f3\u5e8f\u5217\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u89e6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u53ef\u5ef6\u4f38\u81f3\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}

Code and data: https://github.com/ricyoung/tempest-replication", "summary": "Despite substantial investment in safety alignment, the vulnerability of large language models to sophisticated multi-turn adversarial attacks remains poorly characterized, and whether model scale or inference mode affects robustness is unknown. This study employed the TEMPEST multi-turn attack framework to evaluate ten frontier models from eight vendors across 1,000 harmful behaviors, generating over 97,000 API queries across adversarial conversations with automated evaluation by independent safety classifiers. Results demonstrated a spectrum of vulnerability: six models achieved 96% to 100% attack success rate (ASR), while four showed meaningful resistance, with ASR ranging from 42% to 78%; enabling extended reasoning on identical architecture reduced ASR from 97% to 42%. These findings indicate that safety alignment quality varies substantially across vendors, that model scale does not predict adversarial robustness, and that thinking mode provides a deployable safety enhancement. Collectively, this work establishes that current alignment techniques remain fundamentally vulnerable to adaptive multi-turn attacks regardless of model scale, while identifying deliberative inference as a promising defense direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528TEMPEST\u591a\u8f6e\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8610\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57281000\u79cd\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u5382\u5546\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u542f\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u6295\u5165\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u4e14\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528TEMPEST\u591a\u8f6e\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea8\u5bb6\u5382\u5546\u768410\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u57281000\u79cd\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d8597,000\u6b21API\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u72ec\u7acb\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u516d\u6b3e\u6a21\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\u8fbe96%\u2013100%\uff0c\u56db\u6b3e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u6297\u6027\uff08ASR\u4e3a42%\u201378%\uff09\uff1b\u76f8\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u542f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u4f7fASR\u4ece97%\u964d\u81f342%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u800c\u5ba1\u614e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Despite their impressive performance, MLLMs suffer from the modality imbalance issue, where visual information is often underutilized compared to textual representations in deeper layers, leading to degraded visual performance or hallucinations. This issue stems from the predominant reliance on next-text-token-prediction during training, which fails to provide direct visual supervisory signals, resulting in progressive homogenization of visual representations throughout the layers. To this end, we propose Latent Visual Reconstruction (LaVer), a novel training framework that facilitates MLLMs in learning more discriminative visual representations via masked image modeling in the joint latent semantic space of LLM. Our method offers direct visual activation to MLLMs, which exhibit increased visual attention allocation, indicating enhanced utilization of visual information. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks prove the superiority of our approach in various scenarios, especially those requiring dense visual capabilities.

Scaling RL to this size exposes critical inefficiencies-zero-variance prompts that waste rollouts, unstable importance sampling over long horizons, advantage inversion from standard reward models, and systemic bottlenecks in rollout processing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce several unified innovations: (1) Multi-Stage Zero-Variance Elimination, which filters out non-informative prompts and stabilizes group-based policy optimization (e.g. GRPO) by removing wasted rollouts; (2) ESPO, an entropy-adaptive optimization method that balances token-level and sequence-level importance sampling to maintain stable learning dynamics; (3) a Router Replay strategy that aligns training-time MoE router decisions with inference-time behavior to mitigate train-infer discrepancies, coupled with a reward model adjustment to prevent advantage inversion; (4) a high-throughput RL system with FP8-precision rollouts, overlapped reward computation, and length-aware scheduling to eliminate performance bottlenecks. Together, these contributions form a cohesive pipeline that makes RL on hundred-billion-scale MoE models stable and efficient. The resulting model delivers strong performance across both internal and public evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CompassMax-V3-Thinking\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u767e\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684MoE\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\u662f\u2018\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u2019\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21RL\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u7edf\u4e00\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u96f6\u65b9\u5dee\u6d88\u9664\u3001\u71b5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\uff08ESPO\uff09\u3001\u8def\u7531\u5668\u91cd\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u9ad8\u541e\u5410RL\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u96f6\u65b9\u5dee\u63d0\u793a\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u957f\u7a0b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u52bf\u53cd\u8f6c\u3001\u4ee5\u53carollout\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u74f6\u9888\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u65b9\u9762\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(1) \u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u96f6\u65b9\u5dee\u6d88\u9664\u4ee5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u6548\u63d0\u793a\uff1b(2) ESPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861token\u7ea7\u4e0esequence\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\uff1b(3) \u8def\u7531\u5668\u91cd\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684MoE\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u9632\u6b62\u4f18\u52bf\u53cd\u8f6c\uff1b(4) \u57fa\u4e8eFP8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u91cd\u53e0\u5956\u52b1\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u541e\u5410RL\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u767e\u4ebf\u7ea7MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548RL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u53ca\u516c\u5f00\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7edf\u4e00\u6280\u672f\u6808\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u767e\u4ebf\u5143\u7ea7MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Dynamic sparsity (DS) attention mitigates this, yet its hardware efficiency is limited by the added prediction stage and the heavy memory traffic it entails. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BitStopper, a fine-grained algorithm-architecture co-design that operates without a sparsity predictor. First, a bit-serial enable stage fusion (BESF) mechanism is proposed to reuse and minimize the memory access by progressively terminating trivial tokens and merging the prediction stage into the execution stage. Second, a lightweight and adaptive token selection (LATS) strategy is developed to work in concert with the bit-level sparsity speculation. Third, a bit-level asynchronous processing (BAP) strategy is employed to improve compute utilization during the on-demand bit-grained memory fetching. Finally, an elaborate architecture is designed to translate the theoretical complexity reduction into practical performance improvement. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer accelerators, BitStopper achieves 2.03x and 1.89x speedups over Sanger and SOFA, respectively, while delivering 2.4x and 2.1x improvements in energy efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBitStopper\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5-\u67b6\u6784\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u4e32\u884c\u4f7f\u80fd\u9636\u6bb5\u878d\u5408\uff08BESF\uff09\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\uff08LATS\uff09\u548c\u4f4d\u7ea7\u5f02\u6b65\u5904\u7406\uff08BAP\uff09\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\uff08DS\uff09\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56e0\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u9636\u6bb5\u53ca\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBitStopper\uff1a1\uff09\u4f4d\u4e32\u884c\u4f7f\u80fd\u9636\u6bb5\u878d\u5408\uff08BESF\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u9636\u6bb5\u878d\u5408\u5e76\u6e10\u8fdb\u7ec8\u6b62\u5197\u4f59token\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bbf\u5b58\uff1b2\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94token\u9009\u62e9\uff08LATS\uff09\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4f4d\u7ea7\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u6d4b\uff1b3\uff09\u4f4d\u7ea7\u5f02\u6b65\u5904\u7406\uff08BAP\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6309\u9700\u4f4d\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bbf\u5b58\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff1b4\uff09\u914d\u5957\u5b9a\u5236\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\u843d\u5730\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u52a0\u901f\u5668Sanger\u548cSOFA\uff0cBitStopper\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b02.03x\u548c1.89x\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca2.4x\u548c2.1x\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "BitStopper\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u9664\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u878d\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f4d\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a unified model that achieves all three capabilities within a single hierarchical predictive-coding recurrent neural network (PC-RNN) equipped with a class embedding vector, CERNet, which leverages a dynamically updated class embedding vector to unify motor generation and recognition. The model operates in two modes: generation and inference. In the generation mode, the class embedding constrains the hidden state dynamics to a class-specific subspace; in the inference mode, it is optimized online to minimize prediction error, enabling real-time recognition. Validated on a humanoid robot across 26 kinesthetically taught alphabets, our hierarchical model achieves 76% lower trajectory reproduction error than a parameter-matched single-layer baseline, maintains motion fidelity under external perturbations, and infers the demonstrated trajectory class online with 68% Top-1 and 81% Top-2 accuracy. Furthermore, internal prediction errors naturally reflect the model's confidence in its recognition.

Our best-performing model, which we call SETUP, achieves an AnCast score of 84 and a SMATCH++ score of 91, indicating substantial gains towards automatic UMR parsing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u82f1\u6587\u6587\u672c\u5230UMR\uff08Uniform Meaning Representation\uff09\u56fe\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578bSETUP\u5728AnCast\u548cSMATCH++\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523084\u548c91\u5206\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8UMR\u89e3\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "UMR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u56fe\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u867d\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u5230UMR\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u82f1\u6587text-to-UMR\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5fae\u8c03\u73b0\u6709AMR\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5229\u7528Universal Dependencies\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578bSETUP\u5728AnCast\u548cSMATCH++\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u53d6\u5f9784\u548c91\u5206\uff0c\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u82f1\u6587\u6587\u672c\u5230UMR\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aUMR\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u6863\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A device with an infrared depth sensor, a RGB camera, and a four-microphone array is used in sleep monitoring in an environment with barely light sources. One background model is established in depth signals for measuring magnitude of movements. Because depth signals cannot observe lighting changes, another background model is established in color images for measuring magnitude of lighting effects.

This paper studies black-box multi-turn jailbreaks, aiming to train attacker LLMs to elicit harmful content from black-box models through a sequence of prompt-output interactions. Existing approaches typically rely on single turn optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

While robotic systems have been developed for tasks such as powder grinding and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, fully automating powder handling at the milligram scale remains a significant challenge due to the complex flow dynamics of powders and the diversity of laboratory tasks. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel, funnel-shaped, flexible robotic hand that preserves the softness and conical sheet designs in prior work while incorporating a controllable valve at the cone apex to enable precise, incremental dispensing of milligram-scale powder quantities. The hand is integrated with an external balance through a feedback control system based on a model of powder flow and online parameter identification. Experimental evaluations with glass beads, monosodium glutamate, and titanium dioxide demonstrated that 80% of the trials achieved an error within 2 mg, and the maximum error observed was approximately 20 mg across a target range of 20 mg to 3 g. In addition, by incorporating flow prediction models commonly used for hoppers and performing online parameter identification, the system is able to adapt to variations in powder dynamics. Compared to direct PID control, the proposed model-based control significantly improved both accuracy and convergence speed. These results highlight the potential of the proposed system to enable efficient and flexible powder weighing, with scalability toward larger quantities and applicability to a broad range of laboratory automation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6f0f\u6597\u72b6\u67d4\u6027\u673a\u68b0\u624b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u53c2\u6570\u8fa8\u8bc6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6beb\u514b\u7ea7\u7c89\u672b\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u5f0f\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7c89\u4f53\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7c89\u672b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u7c89\u672b\u6d41\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u590d\u6742\u53ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6beb\u514b\u7ea7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7c89\u672b\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26\u53ef\u63a7\u9600\u7684\u6f0f\u6597\u5f62\u67d4\u6027\u673a\u68b0\u624b\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5916\u90e8\u5929\u5e73\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c89\u672b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u53c2\u6570\u8fa8\u8bc6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5e38\u89c1\u6599\u6597\u6d41\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4PID\u63a7\u5236\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73bb\u7483\u5fae\u73e0\u3001\u8c37\u6c28\u9178\u94a0\u548c\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u949b\u4e09\u79cd\u7c89\u4f53\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c80%\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bef\u5dee\u22642 mg\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea620 mg\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u91cf20 mg\u20133 g\uff09\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4PID\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u514b\u7ea7\u7c89\u672b\u79f0\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5411\u66f4\u5927\u5242\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u53ca\u9002\u914d\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Given its wide range of applications, cross-cultural understanding capability is a crucial competency. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating whether LLMs genuinely possess this capability suffer from three key limitations: a lack of contextual scenarios, insufficient cross-cultural concept mapping, and limited deep cultural reasoning capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose SAGE, a scenario-based benchmark built via cross-cultural core concept alignment and generative task design, to evaluate LLMs' cross-cultural understanding and reasoning. Grounded in cultural theory, we categorize cross-cultural capabilities into nine dimensions. Using this framework, we curated 210 core concepts and constructed 4530 test items across 15 specific real-world scenarios, organized under four broader categories of cross-cultural situations, following established item design principles. The SAGE dataset supports continuous expansion, and experiments confirm its transferability to other languages. It reveals model weaknesses across both dimensions and scenarios, exposing systematic limitations in cross-cultural reasoning. While progress has been made, LLMs are still some distance away from reaching a truly nuanced cross-cultural understanding.

The core challenge in stroke classification is modeling the semantic relationships between strokes. Our observations indicate that stroke interactions are typically localized, making it difficult for existing deep learning methods to capture such fine-grained relationships. Although viewing strokes from a point-level perspective can address this issue, it introduces redundancy. However, by selecting reference points and using their sequential order to represent strokes in a fine-grained manner, this problem can be effectively solved. This insight inspired StrokeNet, a novel network architecture encoding strokes as reference pair representations (points + feature vectors), where reference points enable spatial queries and features mediate interaction modeling. Specifically, we dynamically select reference points for each stroke and sequence them, employing an Inline Sequence Attention (ISA) module to construct contextual features. To capture spatial feature interactions, we devised a Cross-Ellipse Query (CEQ) mechanism that clusters reference points and extracts features across varying spatial scales. Finally, a joint optimization framework simultaneously predicts stroke categories via reference points regression and adjacent stroke semantic transition modeling through an Auxiliary Branch (Aux-Branch). Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public online handwritten datasets.

Yet, current evaluation practices overwhelmingly report single-run accuracy while ignoring the intrinsic uncertainty that naturally arises from stochastic decoding. This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting. Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability. Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs. Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability. Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques.

This paper investigates Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) for compressing LLMs for mobile execution. We apply 4-bit PTQ using the BitsAndBytes library with the Hugging Face Transformers framework to Meta's Llama 3.2 3B model. The quantized model is converted to GGUF format using llama.cpp tools for optimized mobile inference. The PTQ workflow achieves a 68.66% reduction in model size through 4-bit quantization, enabling the Llama 3.2 3B model to run efficiently on an Android device. Qualitative validation shows that the 4-bit quantized model can perform inference tasks successfully. We demonstrate the feasibility of running the quantized GGUF model on an Android device using the Termux environment and the Ollama framework.

Many such systems leverage soft components, which enable shape morphing but also introduce simulation and control challenges. Soft-body simulators remain limited in accuracy and computational tractability, while rigid-body simulators cannot capture soft-material dynamics. Here, we present a surrogate compliance modeling approach: rather than explicitly modeling soft-body physics, we introduce indirect variables representing soft-material deformation within a rigid-body simulator. We validate this approach using our amphibious robotic turtle, a quadruped with soft morphing limbs designed for multi-environment locomotion. By capturing deformation effects as changes in effective limb length and limb center of mass, and by applying reinforcement learning with extensive randomization of these indirect variables, we achieve reliable policy learning entirely in a rigid-body simulation. The resulting gaits transfer directly to hardware, demonstrating high-fidelity sim-to-real performance on hard, flat substrates and robust, though lower-fidelity, transfer on rheologically complex terrains. The learned closed-loop gaits exhibit unprecedented terrestrial maneuverability and achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction in cost of transport compared to open-loop baselines.

In this work, we introduce Token Filtering, a lightweight online structured pruning technique that makes pruning decisions directly during inference without any calibration data. The key idea is to measure token redundancy via joint key-value similarity and skip redundant attention computations, thereby reducing inference cost while preserving critical information. To further enhance stability, we design a variance-aware fusion strategy that adaptively weights key and value similarity across heads, ensuring that informative tokens are retained even under high pruning ratios.

Event cameras provide high temporal resolution and low latency, enabling robust estimation under challenging conditions.

In this work, we aim to exploit the spatiotemporal properties of event streams based on point cloud-based framework, designed to enhance human pose estimation performance. We design Event Temporal Slicing Convolution module to capture short-term dependencies across event slices, and combine it with Event Slice Sequencing module for structured temporal modeling. We also apply edge enhancement in point cloud-based event representation to enhance spatial edge information under sparse event conditions to further improve performance.

We describe our ongoing experiments with an implemented system called DEMOCRITUS (Decentralized Extraction of Manifold Ontologies of Causal Relations Integrating Topos Universal Slices) aimed at building, organizing, and visualizing LCMs that span disparate domains extracted from carefully targeted textual queries to LLMs. DEMOCRITUS is methodologically distinct from traditional narrow domain and hypothesis centered causal inference that builds causal models from experiments that produce numerical data. A high-quality LLM is used to propose topics, generate causal questions, and extract plausible causal statements from a diverse range of domains. The technical challenge is then to take these isolated, fragmented, potentially ambiguous and possibly conflicting causal claims, and weave them into a coherent whole, converting them into relational causal triples and embedding them into a LCM. Addressing this technical challenge required inventing new categorical machine learning methods, which we can only briefly summarize in this paper, as it is focused more on the systems side of building DEMOCRITUS. We describe the implementation pipeline for DEMOCRITUS comprising of six modules, examine its computational cost profile to determine where the current bottlenecks in scaling the system to larger models. We describe the results of using DEMOCRITUS over a wide range of domains, spanning archaeology, biology, climate change, economics, medicine and technology.

To address the gap, we evaluate transfer learning approaches for diagnosis-specific mortality prediction and apply both GLM- and XGBoost-based models to the eICU Collaborative Research Database. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning consistently outperforms models trained only on diagnosis-specific data and those using a well-known ICU severity-of-illness score, i.e., APACHE IVa, alone, while also achieving better calibration than models trained on the pooled data. Our findings also suggest that the Youden cutoff is a more appropriate decision threshold than the conventional 0.5 for binary outcomes, and that transfer learning maintains consistently high predictive performance across various cutoff criteria.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u5ba4\uff08ICU\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6309\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7ec4\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bca\u65ad\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6216APACHE IVa\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u548c\u9608\u503c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "ICU\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u5371\u91cd\u75c5\u75c5\u56e0\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8003\u8651\u8bca\u65ad\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eGLM\u548cXGBoost\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728eICU\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4ec5\u7528\u8bca\u65ad\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6570\u636e\u3001APACHE IVa\u8bc4\u5206\u53ca\u5408\u5e76\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30Youden\u622a\u65ad\u70b9\u4e0e0.5\u9608\u503c\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0cYouden\u622a\u65ad\u70b9\u6bd40.5\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u63d0\u5347ICU\u8bca\u65ad\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent works have demonstrated impressive performance by incorporating high-level guidance signals to steer low-level trajectory planners. However, their potential is often constrained by inaccurate high-level guidance and the computational overhead of complex guidance modules. To address these limitations, we propose Mimir, a novel hierarchical dual-system framework capable of generating robust trajectories relying on goal points with uncertainty estimation: (1) Unlike previous approaches that deterministically model, we estimate goal point uncertainty with a Laplace distribution to enhance robustness; (2) To overcome the slow inference speed of the guidance system, we introduce a multi-rate guidance mechanism that predicts extended goal points in advance. Validated on challenging Navhard and Navtest benchmarks, Mimir surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods with a 20% improvement in the driving score EPDMS, while achieving 1.6 times improvement in high-level module inference speed without compromising accuracy.

With just access to simple functional interfaces (e.g., point coordinates), our approach enables the emergence of complex CAD operations (e.g., pattern replication and mirror). This stands in contrast to previous methods, which typically rely on knowledge injected through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), offer limited support for editability, and fail to exploit the strong generative priors of PLMs. Specifically, the ReCAD framework begins by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) to equip them with basic CAD model generation capabilities, where we rewrite CAD scripts into parameterized code that is leveraged to generate accurate textual descriptions for supervision. Then, we propose a novel RL strategy that incorporates parameterized code as guidance to enhance the model's reasoning on challenging questions. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical primitive learning process to progressively teach structured and compositional skills under a unified reward function that ensures both geometric accuracy and semantic fidelity. ReCAD sets a new state-of-the-art in both text-to-CAD and image-to-CAD tasks, significantly improving geometric accuracy across in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. In the image-to-CAD task, for instance, it reduces the mean Chamfer Distance from 73.47 to 29.61 (in-distribution) and from 272.06 to 80.23 (out-of-distribution), outperforming existing baselines by a substantial margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCAD is a reinforcement learning framework that leverages pretrained large models to generate precise parametric CAD models from text or images, achieving state-of-the-art performance by using parameterized code guidance and hierarchical primitive learning.", "motivation": "Existing CAD generation methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning, lack editability, and underutilize the generative priors of pretrained large models.", "method": "ReCAD first fine-tunes vision-language models using parameterized CAD scripts and textual descriptions; then applies a novel RL strategy guided by parameterized code; finally employs hierarchical primitive learning under a unified reward for geometric accuracy and semantic fidelity.", "result": "ReCAD achieves new state-of-the-art results in text-to-CAD and image-to-CAD tasks, notably reducing mean Chamfer Distance from 73.47 to 29.61 (in-distribution) and from 272.06 to 80.23 (out-of-distribution) in image-to-CAD.", "conclusion": "ReCAD demonstrates that bootstrapping PLMs with RL and parameterized code guidance enables emergent, editable, and accurate multimodal CAD generation without heavy supervision."}}

We stress-tested sandbagging detection techniques using an auditing game. First, a red team fine-tuned five models, some of which conditionally underperformed, as a proxy for sandbagging. Second, a blue team used black-box, model-internals, or training-based approaches to identify sandbagging models. We found that the blue team could not reliably discriminate sandbaggers from benign models. Black-box approaches were defeated by effective imitation of a weaker model. Linear probes, a model-internals approach, showed more promise but their naive application was vulnerable to behaviours instilled by the red team. We also explored capability elicitation as a strategy for detecting sandbagging. Although Prompt-based elicitation was not reliable, training-based elicitation consistently elicited full performance from the sandbagging models, using only a single correct demonstration of the evaluation task. However the performance of benign models was sometimes also raised, so relying on elicitation as a detection strategy was prone to false-positives. In the short-term, we recommend developers remove potential sandbagging using on-distribution training for elicitation.

A key difficulty is that jointly processing PAN and MS often entangles spatial detail with spectral fidelity. We propose S2WMamba, which explicitly disentangles frequency information and then performs lightweight cross-modal interaction. Concretely, a 2D Haar DWT is applied to PAN to localize spatial edges and textures, while a channel-wise 1D Haar DWT treats each pixel's spectrum as a 1D signal to separate low/high-frequency components and limit spectral distortion. The resulting Spectral branch injects wavelet-extracted spatial details into MS features, and the Spatial branch refines PAN features using spectra from the 1D pyramid; the two branches exchange information through Mamba-based cross-modulation that models long-range dependencies with linear complexity. A multi-scale dynamic gate (multiplicative + additive) then adaptively fuses branch outputs.On WV3, GF2, and QB, S2WMamba matches or surpasses recent strong baselines (FusionMamba, CANNet, U2Net, ARConv), improving PSNR by up to 0.23 dB and reaching HQNR 0.956 on full-resolution WV3. Ablations justify the choice of 2D/1D DWT placement, parallel dual branches, and the fusion gate.

However, its progress is hindered by the misalignment between discrete token-level objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and continuous numerical values. Existing approaches relying on token-level constraints often fail to capture the global magnitude of the target value, limiting their precision and generalization. In this paper, we propose to unlock the potential of decoding-based regression via Reinforcement Learning (RL). We formulate the generation process as a Markov Decision Process, utilizing sequence-level rewards to enforce global numerical coherence. Extensive experiments on tabular regression and code metric regression demonstrate that our method (specifically with ReMax and GRPO) consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art token-level baselines and traditional regression heads, showing the superiority of introducing sequence-level signals. Our analysis further reveals that RL significantly enhances sampling efficiency and predictive precision, establishing decoding-based regression as a robust and accurate paradigm for general-purpose numerical prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563token\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u6307\u6807\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u7801\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\u5c06\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563token\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff09\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u503c\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u73b0\u6709token\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6574\u4f53\u6570\u503c\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u5982\u6570\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u5173\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528ReMax\u548cGRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8868\u683c\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u6307\u6807\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u8fdbtoken\u7ea7\u57fa\u7ebf\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u5f52\u5934\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eRL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91ca\u653e\u89e3\u7801\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Drawing on a five-day Wizard-of-Oz deployment of a mobile service robot in a university cafe, we analyze how people signal interaction readiness through nonverbal behaviors and how expert wizards use these cues to guide engagement. Motivated by these observations, we propose a two-stage pipeline in which lightweight perceptual detectors (gaze shifts and proxemics) are used to selectively trigger heavier video-based vision-language model (VLM) queries at socially meaningful moments. We evaluate this pipeline on replayed field interactions and compare two prompting strategies.

Zhong"], "title": "CryoHype: Reconstructing a thousand cryo-EM structures with transformer-based hypernetworks", "comment": null, "summary": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an indispensable technique for determining the 3D structures of dynamic biomolecular complexes. While typically applied to image a single molecular species, cryo-EM has the potential for structure determination of many targets simultaneously in a high-throughput fashion. However, existing methods typically focus on modeling conformational heterogeneity within a single or a few structures and are not designed to resolve compositional heterogeneity arising from mixtures of many distinct molecular species.

Decoupled loss improves coupled-loss style of algorithms' (e.g., PPO, GRPO) learning stability by introducing a proximal policy to decouple the off-policy corrections (importance weight) from the controlling policy updates (trust region). However, the proximal policy requires an extra forward pass through the network at each training step, creating a computational bottleneck for large language models. We observe that since the proximal policy only serves as a trust region anchor between the behavior and target policies, we can approximate it through simple interpolation without explicit computation.

As the standards for immersion in XR continue to increase, the demands for SLAM benchmarking have become more stringent. Trajectory accuracy is the key metric, and marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to generate ground truth (GT) because of their drift-free and relatively accurate measurements. However, the precision of MoCap-based GT is limited by two factors: the spatiotemporal calibration with the device under test (DUT) and the inherent jitter in the MoCap measurements. These limitations hinder accurate SLAM benchmarking, particularly for key metrics like rotation error and inter-frame jitter, which are critical for immersive XR experiences. This paper presents a novel continuous-time maximum likelihood estimator to address these challenges. The proposed method integrates auxiliary inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to compensate for MoCap jitter. Additionally, a variable time synchronization method and a pose residual based on screw congruence constraints are proposed, enabling precise spatiotemporal calibration across multiple sensors and the DUT. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, achieving the precision necessary for comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms in XR applications. Furthermore, we thoroughly validate the practicality of our method by benchmarking several leading XR devices and open-source SLAM algorithms.

However, temporal reasoning, particularly under complex temporal constraints, remains a major challenge. To this end, existing approaches have explored symbolic methods, which encode temporal structure explicitly, and reflective mechanisms, which revise reasoning errors through multi-step inference. Nonetheless, symbolic approaches often underutilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while reflective methods typically lack structured temporal representations, which can result in inconsistent or hallucinated reasoning. As a result, even when the correct temporal context is available, LLMs may still misinterpret or misapply time-related information, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning (NeSTR), a novel framework that integrates structured symbolic representations with hybrid reflective reasoning to enhance the temporal sensitivity of LLM inference. NeSTR preserves explicit temporal relations through symbolic encoding, enforces logical consistency via verification, and corrects flawed inferences using abductive reflection.

In this work, we reassess the positioning and role of of multimodal guidance, and propose a Multimodal-Guided Task-Aware Generative Image Compression (MTGC) framework. Specifically, MTGC integrates three guidance modalities to enhance semantic consistency: a concise but robust text caption for global semantics, a highly compressed image (HCI) retaining low-level visual information, and Semantic Pseudo-Words (SPWs) for fine-grained task-relevant semantics. The SPWs are generated by our designed Task-Aware Semantic Compression Module (TASCM), which operates in a task-oriented manner to drive the multi-head self-attention mechanism to focus on and extract semantics relevant to the generation task while filtering out redundancy. Subsequently, to facilitate the synergistic guidance of these modalities, we design a Multimodal-Guided Diffusion Decoder (MGDD) employing a dual-path cooperative guidance mechanism that synergizes cross-attention and ControlNet additive residuals to precisely inject these three guidance into the diffusion process, and leverages the diffusion model's powerful generative priors to reconstruct the image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTGC consistently improves semantic consistency (e.g., DISTS drops by 10.59% on the DIV2K dataset) while also achieving remarkable gains in perceptual quality and pixel-level fidelity at ultra-low bitrate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff08MTGC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4f2a\u8bcd\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\uff08<0.05 bpp\uff09\u4e0b\u6613\u56e0\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db36G\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMTGC\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\uff08HCI\uff09\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4f2a\u8bcd\uff08SPWs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e09\u91cd\u6a21\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u5757\uff08TASCM\uff09\u751f\u6210SPWs\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08MGDD\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0eControlNet\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u534f\u540c\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728DIV2K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aDISTS\u4e0b\u964d10.59%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\uff0cMTGC\u4e3a\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u9760\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Once fixed coordinates and operators are removed, a neural network appears as a learnable numerical computation shaped by manifold complexity, high-order nonlinearity, and boundary conditions. Real-world data impose strong data complexity, near-infinite scope, scale, and minibatch fragmentation, while training dynamics produce learning complexity through shifting node covers, curvature accumulation, and the rise and decay of plasticity. These forces constrain learnability and explain why capability emerges only when fixed-point regions stabilize. Neural networks do not begin with fixed points; they construct them through residual-driven iteration. This perspective clarifies the limits of monolithic models under geometric and data-induced plasticity and motivates architectures and federated systems that distribute manifold complexity across many elastic models, forming a coherent world-modeling framework grounded in geometry, algebra, fixed points, and real-data complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5806\u53e0\u5206\u6bb5\u6d41\u5f62\u3001\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u53d7\u6d41\u5f62\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u5851\u9020\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5171\u540c\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5236\u7ea6\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u529b\u6d8c\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u5c06\u6d41\u5f62\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5f39\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u8054\u90a6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u4ee3\u6570\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u8fd1\u65e0\u9650\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53c8\u5f15\u5165\u8282\u70b9\u8986\u76d6\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u66f2\u7387\u7d2f\u79ef\u53ca\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u6da8\u843d\u7b49\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u6d8c\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5806\u53e0\u5206\u6bb5\u6d41\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5265\u79bb\u56fa\u5b9a\u5750\u6807\u4e0e\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u7531\u6d41\u5f62\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5e76\u975e\u8d77\u59cb\u4e8e\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e3b\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\uff1b\u80fd\u529b\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u533a\u57df\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u7531\u6b64\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5355\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u4ee3\u6570\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u53d7\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u6d41\u5f62\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u3001\u4ee3\u6570\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5171\u540c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u672a\u6765AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u7684\u2018\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u53cc\u91cd\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent state-of-the-art ED methods leverage the pre-trained knowledge and semantic capability embedded in large language models (LLMs) to directly label whether a cell is erroneous. However, this LLM-as-a-labeler pipeline (1) relies on the black box, implicit decision process, thus failing to provide explainability for the detection results, and (2) is highly sensitive to prompts, yielding inconsistent outputs due to inherent model stochasticity, therefore lacking robustness. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-as-an-inducer framework that adopts LLM to induce the decision tree for ED (termed TreeED) and further ensembles multiple such trees for consensus detection (termed ForestED), thereby improving explainability and robustness. Specifically, based on prompts derived from data context, decision tree specifications and output requirements, TreeED queries the LLM to induce the decision tree skeleton, whose root-to-leaf decision paths specify the stepwise procedure for evaluating a given sample. Each tree contains three types of nodes: (1) rule nodes that perform simple validation checks (e.g., format or range), (2) Graph Neural Network (GNN) nodes that capture complex patterns (e.g., functional dependencies), and (3) leaf nodes that output the final decision types (error or clean).

This paper introduces the Quantum-Leap LSTM (QL-LSTM), a recurrent architecture designed to address both challenges through two independent components. The Parameter-Shared Unified Gating mechanism replaces all gate-specific transformations with a single shared weight matrix, reducing parameters by approximately 48 percent while preserving full gating behavior. The Hierarchical Gated Recurrence with Additive Skip Connections component adds a multiplication-free pathway that improves long-range information flow and reduces forget-gate degradation. We evaluate QL-LSTM on sentiment classification using the IMDB dataset with extended document lengths, comparing it to LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM reference models. QL-LSTM achieves competitive accuracy while using substantially fewer parameters.

In this work, we explicitly build a topological model of the configuration space of a tethered robot starting from a polygonal representation of the workspace where the robot moves. To do so, we first establish a link between the configuration space of the tethered robot and the universal covering space of the workspace, and then we exploit this link to develop an algorithm to compute a simplicial complex model of the configuration space. We show how this approach improves the performances of existing algorithms that build other types of representations of the configuration space. The proposed model can be computed in a fraction of the time required to build traditional homotopy-augmented graphs, and is continuous, allowing to solve the path planning task for tethered robots using a broad set of path planning algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7559\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6784\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e07\u6709\u8986\u53e0\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7559\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u6563\u6784\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u523b\u753b\u7cfb\u7f06\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4d\u59ff\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7cfb\u7559\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6784\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e07\u6709\u8986\u53e0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6784\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5355\u7eaf\u590d\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u4f26\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u62d3\u6251\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7559\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6784\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

We address this gap by developing a high-quality Telugu--English speech translation benchmark from 46 hours of manually verified CSTD corpus data (30h/8h/8h train/dev/test split). Our systematic comparison of cascaded versus end-to-end architectures shows that while IndicWhisper + IndicMT achieves the highest performance due to extensive Telugu-specific training data, finetuned SeamlessM4T models demonstrate remarkable competitiveness despite using significantly less Telugu-specific training data. This finding suggests that with careful hyperparameter tuning and sufficient parallel data (potentially less than 100 hours), end-to-end systems can achieve performance comparable to cascaded approaches in low-resource settings. Our metric reliability study evaluating BLEU, METEOR, ChrF++, ROUGE-L, TER, and BERTScore against human judgments reveals that traditional metrics provide better quality discrimination than BERTScore for Telugu--English translation. The work delivers three key contributions: a reproducible Telugu--English benchmark, empirical evidence of competitive end-to-end performance potential in low-resource scenarios, and practical guidance for automatic evaluation in morphologically complex language pairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6cf0\u5362\u56fa\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7ea7\u8054\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ecf\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SeamlessM4T\uff09\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7ea7\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982BLEU\u3001METEOR\uff09\u6bd4BERTScore\u66f4\u5951\u5408\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u6cf0\u5362\u56fa\u8bed\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d858000\u4e07\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5176\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7814\u7a76\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e46\u5c0f\u65f6\u4eba\u5de5\u6821\u9a8c\u7684CSTD\u8bed\u6599\u6784\u5efa\u6cf0\u5362\u56fa\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0830h/8h/8h\u5212\u5206\uff09\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4IndicWhisper+IndicMT\uff08\u7ea7\u8054\uff09\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03SeamlessM4T\uff08\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\uff09\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5f00\u5c55\u591a\u6307\u6807\uff08BLEU\u3001METEOR\u3001ChrF++\u3001ROUGE-L\u3001TER\u3001BERTScore\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "IndicWhisper+IndicMT\u56e0\u5927\u91cf\u6cf0\u5362\u56fa\u8bed\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1bSeamlessM4T\u7ecf\u8c03\u4f18\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728<100\u5c0f\u65f6\u5e73\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea7\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u5224\u522b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eBERTScore\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5f62\u6001\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, their real-world deployment remains challenging due to high computational and memory demands. Mixed-Precision Quantization (MPQ), designed to push the limits of quantization, has demonstrated remarkable success in advancing U-Net quantization to sub-4bit settings while significantly reducing computational and memory overhead. Nevertheless, its application to DiT architectures remains limited and underexplored. In this work, we propose TreeQ, a unified framework addressing key challenges in DiT quantization. First, to tackle inefficient search and proxy misalignment, we introduce Tree Structured Search (TSS). This DiT-specific approach leverages the architecture's linear properties to traverse the solution space in O(n) time while improving objective accuracy through comparison-based pruning. Second, to unify optimization objectives, we propose Environmental Noise Guidance (ENG), which aligns Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) configurations using a single hyperparameter. Third, to mitigate information bottlenecks in ultra-low-bit regimes, we design the General Monarch Branch (GMB). This structured sparse branch prevents irreversible information loss, enabling finer detail generation. Through extensive experiments, our TreeQ framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on DiT-XL/2 under W3A3 and W4A4 PTQ/PEFT settings. Notably, our work is the first to achieve near-lossless 4-bit PTQ performance on DiT models.

When multiple USVs operate in the same area, they may be required to dock to each other to perform a shared task. Existing approaches for the docking between autonomous USVs generally consider one USV as a stationary target, while the second one is tasked to reach the required docking pose. In this work, we propose a cooperative approach for USV-USV docking, where two USVs work together to dock at an agreed location. We use a centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to solve the control problem, obtaining feasible trajectories that also guarantee constraint satisfaction. Owing to its model-based nature, this approach allows the rejection of disturbances, inclusive of exogenous inputs, by anticipating their effect on the USVs through the MPC prediction model.

We present a systematic investigation into cross-lingual continuous pretraining for low-resource languages, using Perso-Arabic languages (Persian, Arabic, and Urdu) as our primary case study. Our approach demonstrates that strategic utilization of unlabeled speech data can effectively bridge the resource gap without sacrificing recognition accuracy. We construct a 3,000-hour multilingual corpus through a scalable unlabeled data collection pipeline and employ targeted continual pretraining combined with morphologically-aware tokenization to develop a 300M parameter model that achieves performance comparable to systems 5 times larger. Our model outperforms Whisper Large v3 (1.5B parameters) on Persian and achieves competitive results on Arabic and Urdu despite using significantly fewer parameters and substantially less labeled data. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that ASR quality scales primarily with model size, revealing instead that data relevance and strategic pretraining are more critical factors for low-resource scenarios.

This work reframes an editing-purpose latent diffusion model to effectively perceive and process highly ambiguous, layered image inputs, yielding high-quality outputs. We argue that the challenge of this conversion stems from a critical yet overlooked issue, i.e., the latent space of semantic encoders lacks the inherent structure to interpret a composite image as a linear superposition of its constituent layers. Our approach is built on three synergistic components, including a reflection-equivariant VAE that aligns the latent space with the linear physics of reflection formation, a learnable task-specific text embedding for precise guidance that bypasses ambiguous language, and a depth-guided early-branching sampling strategy to harness generative stochasticity for promising results.

Recent research has examined whether these self-explanations faithfully reflect the models' actual behavior and has found that they often lack faithfulness. However, the question of how to improve faithfulness remains underexplored. Moreover, because different explanation styles have superficially distinct characteristics, it is unclear whether improvements observed in one style also arise when using other styles. This study analyzes the effects of training for faithful self-explanations and the extent to which these effects generalize, using three classification tasks and three explanation styles. We construct one-word constrained explanations that are likely to be faithful using a feature attribution method, and use these pseudo-faithful self-explanations for continual learning on instruction-tuned models. Our experiments demonstrate that training can improve self-explanation faithfulness across all classification tasks and explanation styles, and that these improvements also show signs of generalization to the multi-word settings and to unseen tasks. Furthermore, we find consistent cross-style generalization among three styles, suggesting that training may contribute to a broader improvement in faithful self-explanation ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5355\u5b57\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8de8\u89e3\u91ca\u98ce\u683c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08faithfulness\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u91ca\u98ce\u683c\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u5355\u5b57\u7ea6\u675f\u4f2a\u53ef\u4fe1\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u98ce\u683c\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u591a\u5b57\u8bbe\u7f6e\u53ca\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u4e09\u79cd\u98ce\u683c\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8de8\u98ce\u683c\u6cdb\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u4fe1\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e14\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We aim to achieve comprehensive protection of biometric data by implementing a unified physical-digital defense framework with advanced detection. Existing approaches primarily employ CLIP with regularization constraints to enhance model generalization across both tasks. However, these methods suffer from conflicting optimization directions between physical and digital attack detection under same category prompt spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Spoofing-aware Prompt Learning for Unified Attack Detection (SPL-UAD) framework, which decouples optimization branches for physical and digital attacks in the prompt space. Specifically, we construct a learnable parallel prompt branch enhanced with adaptive Spoofing Context Prompt Generation, enabling independent control of optimization for each attack type. Furthermore, we design a Cues-awareness Augmentation that leverages the dual-prompt mechanism to generate challenging sample mining tasks on data, significantly enhancing the model's robustness against unseen attack types.

It is difficult to train due to discretization. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective technique, dubbed Gaussian Quant (GQ), that converts a Gaussian VAE with certain constraint into a VQ-VAE without training. GQ generates random Gaussian noise as a codebook and finds the closest noise to the posterior mean. Theoretically, we prove that when the logarithm of the codebook size exceeds the bits-back coding rate of the Gaussian VAE, a small quantization error is guaranteed. Practically, we propose a heuristic to train Gaussian VAE for effective GQ, named target divergence constraint (TDC).

To address these limitations, we propose to incorporate hybrid geometric priors that combine SMPL human body models with monocular depth estimation. Our approach leverages structured human priors to maintain surface consistency while capturing fine-grained geometric details in human regions. We introduce Human3R, featuring a hierarchical pipeline with refinement components that processes full-resolution images for overall scene geometry, then applies strategic cropping and cross-attention fusion for human-specific detail enhancement.

However, many classical forecasting models struggle with noisy input, regime shifts, and limited generalization capacity. To address these challenges, we propose a Quantum Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (QTCNN) that combines a classical temporal encoder with parameter-efficient quantum convolution circuits for cross-sectional equity return prediction. The temporal encoder extracts multi-scale patterns from sequential technical indicators, while the quantum processing leverages superposition and entanglement to enhance feature representation and suppress overfitting.

In such settings, limited perception, ambiguous terrain cues, and insufficient adaptation of gait timing can cause even a single misplaced or mistimed step to result in rapid loss of balance. We introduce a perceptive locomotion framework that merges terrain sensing, gait regulation, and whole-body control into a single reinforcement learning policy. A downward-facing depth camera mounted under the base observes the support region around the feet, and a compact U-Net reconstructs a dense egocentric height map from each frame in real time, operating at the same frequency as the control loop. The perceptual height map, together with proprioceptive observations, is processed by a unified policy that produces joint commands and a global stepping-phase signal, allowing gait timing and whole-body posture to be adapted jointly to the commanded motion and local terrain geometry. We further adopt a single-stage successive teacher-student training scheme for efficient policy learning and knowledge transfer. Experiments conducted on a 31-DoF, 1.65 m humanoid robot demonstrate robust locomotion in both simulation and real-world settings, including forward and backward stair ascent and descent, as well as crossing a 46 cm gap.

Language models frequently produce unreliable reasoning with plausible but incorrect solutions that are difficult to verify. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning models to use Prolog as an external tool for verifiable computation. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we fine-tune Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on a cleaned GSM8K-Prolog-Prover dataset while varying (i) prompt structure, (ii) reward composition (execution, syntax, semantics, structure), and (iii) inference protocol: single-shot, best-of-N, and two agentic modes where Prolog is invoked internally or independently. Our reinforcement learning approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning, with our 3B model achieving zero-shot MMLU performance comparable to 7B few-shot results. Our findings reveal that: 1) joint tuning of prompt, reward, and inference shapes program syntax and logic; 2) best-of-N with external Prolog verification maximizes accuracy on GSM8K; 3) agentic inference with internal repair yields superior zero-shot generalization on MMLU-Stem and MMLU-Pro. These results demonstrate that grounding model reasoning in formal verification systems substantially improves reliability and auditability for safety-critical applications.

However, existing TiVR paradigms mainly focus on integrating various visual tools through reinforcement learning, while neglecting to design effective response mechanisms for handling unreliable or erroneous tool outputs. This limitation is particularly pronounced in referring and grounding tasks, where inaccurate detection tool predictions often mislead TiVR models into generating hallucinated reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the VG-Refiner, the first framework aiming at the tool-refined referring grounded reasoning.

Approximately 15 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables", "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for the detection of fake news by modeling the content and propagation structure of news articles on social media. We show that two of the most commonly used benchmark data sets - GossipCop and PolitiFact - are poorly suited to evaluating the utility of models that use propagation structure. Specifically, these data sets exhibit shallow, ego-like graph topologies that provide little or no ability to differentiate among modeling methods. We systematically benchmark five GNN architectures against a structure-agnostic multilayer perceptron (MLP) that uses the same node features. We show that MLPs match or closely trail the performance of GNNs, with performance gaps often within 1-2% and overlapping confidence intervals. To isolate the contribution of structure in these datasets, we conduct controlled experiments where node features are shuffled or edge structures randomized. We find that performance collapses under feature shuffling but remains stable under edge randomization. This suggests that structure plays a negligible role in these benchmarks. Structural analysis further reveals that over 75% of nodes are only one hop from the root, exhibiting minimal structural diversity. In contrast, on synthetic datasets where node features are noisy and structure is informative, GNNs significantly outperform MLPs. These findings provide strong evidence that widely used benchmarks do not meaningfully test the utility of modeling structural features, and they motivate the development of datasets with richer, more diverse graph topologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51faGossipCop\u548cPolitiFact\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8fc7\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\uff08\u5982ego-like\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u5229\u7528\u4f20\u64ad\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GNN\uff09\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMLP\u4e0eGNN\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u968f\u673a\u5316\uff09\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u7279\u5f81\u6253\u4e71\u5219\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8d21\u732e\u6781\u5c0f\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u547c\u5401\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08GossipCop\u3001PolitiFact\uff09\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u662f\u5426\u771f\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0GNN\u4f18\u52bf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5efa\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9GossipCop\u548cPolitiFact\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u8282\u70b9\u8df3\u8ddd\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd45\u79cdGNN\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684MLP\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u6253\u4e71\u548c\u8fb9\u7ed3\u6784\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7b49\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1GNN\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u7528\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "MLP\u4e0eGNN\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ec51\u20132%\uff0c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\uff1b\u8fb9\u968f\u673a\u5316\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u6253\u4e71\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b>75%\u8282\u70b9\u8ddd\u6839\u8282\u70b9\u4ec51\u8df3\uff1b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cGNN\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eMLP\u3002", "conclusion": "GossipCop\u548cPolitiFact\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u56e0\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u9a8cGNN\u5229\u7528\u4f20\u64ad\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u62d3\u6251\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u5177\u5224\u522b\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the \"Memory Trap\". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average improvement of 23.5% across different VLA backbones ($\u03c0_{0}$ and $\u03c0_{0.5}$) under out-of-distribution scenarios on real-world robotic platforms, and 20.2% on the LIBERO-Pro benchmark, validating its effectiveness in enhancing VLA robustness to distribution shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAffordance Field Intervention (AFI)\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u51653D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) \u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5176\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u2018\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9677\u9631\u2019\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6613\u9677\u5165\u2018\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9677\u9631\u2019\u2014\u2014\u5373\u590d\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8f68\u8ff9\u800c\u975e\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522b\u964c\u751f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAFI\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528SAFs\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9677\u9631\uff1b\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u81f3\u9ad8\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u70b9\u4ee5\u951a\u5b9aVLA\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u5e76\u7528SAF\u6253\u5206\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u7d2f\u79ef\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u7684OOD\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cVLA\u4e3b\u5e72\uff08\u03c0\u2080\u548c\u03c0\u2080.\u2085\uff09\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534723.5%\uff1b\u5728LIBERO-Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u534720.2%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "AFI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A Diagnostic Evaluation Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent text-to-video models have enabled the generation of high-resolution driving scenes from natural language prompts. These AI-generated driving videos (AIGVs) offer a low-cost, scalable alternative to real or simulator data for autonomous driving (AD). But a key question remains: can such videos reliably support training and evaluation of AD models? We present a diagnostic framework that systematically studies this question. First, we introduce a taxonomy of frequent AIGV failure modes, including visual artifacts, physically implausible motion, and violations of traffic semantics, and demonstrate their negative impact on object detection, tracking, and instance segmentation. To support this analysis, we build ADGV-Bench, a driving-focused benchmark with human quality annotations and dense labels for multiple perception tasks. We then propose ADGVE, a driving-aware evaluator that combines static semantics, temporal cues, lane obedience signals, and Vision-Language Model(VLM)-guided reasoning into a single quality score for each clip. Experiments show that blindly adding raw AIGVs can degrade perception performance, while filtering them with ADGVE consistently improves both general video quality assessment metrics and downstream AD models, and turns AIGVs into a beneficial complement to real-world data. Our study highlights both the risks and the promise of AIGVs, and provides practical tools for safely leveraging large-scale video generation in future AD pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u751f\u6210\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\uff08AIGVs\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff08AD\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u57fa\u51c6ADGV-Bench\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668ADGVE\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u7ecfADGVE\u7b5b\u9009\u7684AIGVs\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u652f\u6491\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAIGV\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u542b\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e13\u7528\u57fa\u51c6ADGV-Bench\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u9759\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u8f66\u9053\u9075\u4ece\u4fe1\u53f7\u548cVLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668ADGVE\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cbAIGVs\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u7528ADGVE\u7b5b\u9009\u540e\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38AD\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7fAIGVs\u6210\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u3002", "conclusion": "AIGVs\u65e2\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u4e5f\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76 pipeline \u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u3002"}}

Fraud is difficult to detect because of covert tactics and the high labor and time costs of audits. Traditional statistical models are interpretable but struggle with nonlinear feature interactions, while machine learning models are powerful but often opaque. In addition, most existing methods judge fraud only for the current year based on current year data, limiting timeliness.\n  This paper proposes a financial fraud detection framework for Chinese A-share listed companies based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We design a feature engineering scheme that transforms firm-year panel data into image like representations, enabling the CNN to capture cross-sectional and temporal patterns and to predict fraud in advance. Experiments show that the CNN outperforms logistic regression and LightGBM in accuracy, robustness, and early-warning performance, and that proper tuning of the classification threshold is crucial in high-risk settings.\n  To address interpretability, we analyze the model along the dimensions of entity, feature, and time using local explanation techniques. We find that solvency, ratio structure, governance structure, and internal control are general predictors of fraud, while environmental indicators matter mainly in high-pollution industries. Non-fraud firms share stable feature patterns, whereas fraud firms exhibit heterogeneous patterns concentrated in short time windows. A case study of Guanong Shares in 2022 shows that cash flow analysis, social responsibility, governance structure, and per-share indicators are the main drivers of the model's fraud prediction, consistent with the company's documented misconduct.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u7684\u4e2d\u56fdA\u80a1\u4e0a\u5e02\u516c\u53f8\u8d22\u52a1\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7c7b\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6b3a\u8bc8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u507f\u503a\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6bd4\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6b3a\u8bc8\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u5e74\u6570\u636e\u5224\u65ad\u6b3a\u8bc8\uff0c\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8d22\u52a1\u6b3a\u8bc8\u9690\u853d\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u5411\u9762\u677f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u516c\u53f8-\u5e74\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7c7b\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6784\u5efaCNN\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982LIME\u6216SHAP\uff09\u4ece\u5b9e\u4f53\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "CNN\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548cLightGBM\uff1b\u507f\u503a\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6bd4\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u662f\u901a\u7528\u6b3a\u8bc8\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u9ad8\u6c61\u67d3\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u73af\u5883\u7c7b\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u6b3a\u8bc8\u4f01\u4e1a\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f\u5448\u77ed\u671f\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u975e\u6b3a\u8bc8\u4f01\u4e1a\u5219\u8f83\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d22\u52a1\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7ba1\u9884\u8b66\u4e0e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8f85\u52a9\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Identifying a near-complete set of relevant driving scenarios for such functionalities is challenging due to numerous degrees of freedom involved, each affecting the outcomes of the driving scenario differently. Moreover, with increasing technical complexity of new functionalities, the number of potentially relevant, particularly \"unknown unsafe\" scenarios is increasing. To enhance validation efficiency, it is essential to identify relevant scenarios in advance, starting with simpler domains like highways before moving to more complex environments such as urban traffic. To address this, this paper focuses on analyzing lane change scenarios in highway traffic, which involve multiple degrees of freedom and present numerous safetyrelevant scenarios. We describe the process of data acquisition and processing of real-world data from public highway traffic, followed by the application of criticality measures on trajectory data to evaluate scenarios, as conducted within the AVEAS project (www.aveas.org). By linking the calculated measures to specific lane change driving scenarios and the conditions under which the data was collected, we facilitate the identification of safetyrelevant driving scenarios for various applications. Further, to tackle the extensive range of \"unknown unsafe\" scenarios, we propose a way to generate relevant scenarios by creating synthetic scenarios based on recorded ones. Consequently, we demonstrate and evaluate a processing chain that enables the identification of safety-relevant scenarios, the development of data-driven methods for extracting these scenarios, and the generation of synthetic critical scenarios via sampling on highways.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u53d8\u9053\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u5173\u952e\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u201c\u672a\u77e5\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u201d\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8986\u76d6\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6280\u672f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4ece\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u7b49\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\u573a\u666f\u5207\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eAVEAS\u9879\u76ee\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5173\u952e\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d8\u9053\u573a\u666f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u53d8\u9053\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u91c7\u96c6\u6761\u4ef6\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5904\u7406\u94fe\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u9053\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u5371\u53d8\u9053\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u94fe\u8def\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u53d8\u9053\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9776\u5411\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u2018\u672a\u77e5\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u2019\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Across eight reasoning benchmarks, NPR trained on Qwen3-4B achieves performance gains of up to 24.5% and inference speedups up to 4.6x.

However, future affective computing requires more comprehensive and precise emotion metrics which could be measured by VAD(Valence-Arousal-Dominance) multidimension parameters. To address this, AffectNet has tried to add VA (Valence and Arousal) information, but still lacks D(Dominance). Thus, the research introduces VAD annotation on FER2013 dataset, takes the initiative to label D(Dominance) dimension. Then, to further improve network capacity, it enforces orthogonalized convolution on it, which extracts more diverse and expressive features and will finally increase the prediction accuracy. Experiment results show that D dimension could be measured but is difficult to obtain compared with V and A dimension no matter in manual annotation or regression network prediction. Secondly, the ablation test by introducing orthogonal convolution verifies that better VAD prediction could be obtained in the configuration of orthogonal convolution. Therefore, the research provides an initiative labelling for D dimension on FER dataset, and proposes a better prediction network for VAD prediction through orthogonal convolution. The newly built VAD annotated FER2013 dataset could act as a benchmark to measure VAD multidimensional emotions, while the orthogonalized regression network based on ResNet could act as the facial expression recognition baseline for VAD emotion prediction.

Because BC monitoring is typically performed using costly and specialized instruments. there is little to no available data on BC from local traffic sources that could help inform policy interventions targeting local factors. By contrast, traffic monitoring systems are widely deployed in cities around the world, highlighting the imbalance between what we know about traffic conditions and what do not know about their environmental consequences. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine learning-driven system that extracts visual information from traffic video to capture vehicles behaviors and conditions. Combining these features with weather data, our model estimates BC at street level, achieving an R-squared value of 0.72 and RMSE of 129.42 ng/m3 (nanogram per cubic meter). From a sustainability perspective, this work leverages resources already supported by urban infrastructure and established modeling techniques to generate information relevant to traffic emission.

Traditional testing methods, such as virtual simulation, closed-course, and public road testing, face several challenges, including unrealistic vehicle states, limited testing capabilities, and high costs. These issues have prompted increasing interest in virtual-physical fusion testing. However, despite its potential, virtual-physical fusion testing still faces challenges, such as limited element types, narrow testing scope, and fixed evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose the Virtual-Physical Testing Platform for Autonomous Vehicles (VP-AutoTest), which integrates over ten types of virtual and physical elements, including vehicles, pedestrians, and roadside infrastructure, to replicate the diversity of real-world traffic participants. The platform also supports both single-vehicle interaction and multi-vehicle cooperation testing, employing adversarial testing and parallel deduction to accelerate fault detection and explore algorithmic limits, while OBU and Redis communication enable seamless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperation across all levels of cooperative automation. Furthermore, VP-AutoTest incorporates a multidimensional evaluation framework and AI-driven expert systems to conduct comprehensive performance assessment and defect diagnosis. Finally, by comparing virtual-physical fusion test results with real-world experiments, the platform performs credibility self-evaluation to ensure both the fidelity and efficiency of autonomous driving testing.

Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) optimizes such models over full tool-interaction trajectories, but two key challenges hinder effectiveness: (1) Sparse, non-instructive rewards, such as binary 0-1 verifiable signals, provide limited guidance for intermediate steps and slow convergence; (2) Gradient degradation in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), where identical rewards within a rollout group yield zero advantage, reducing sample efficiency and destabilizing training. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary techniques: Progressive Reward Shaping (PRS) and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization (VSPO). PRS is a curriculum-inspired reward design that introduces dense, stage-wise feedback - encouraging models to first master parseable and properly formatted tool calls, then optimize for factual correctness and answer quality. We instantiate PRS for short-form QA (with a length-aware BLEU to fairly score concise answers) and long-form QA (with LLM-as-a-Judge scoring to prevent reward hacking). VSPO is an enhanced GRPO variant that replaces low-value samples with prompts selected by a task-value metric balancing difficulty and uncertainty, and applies value-smoothing clipping to stabilize gradient updates. Experiments on multiple short-form and long-form QA benchmarks show that PRS consistently outperforms traditional binary rewards, and VSPO achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and higher final performance compared to PPO, GRPO, CISPO, and SFT-only baselines. Together, PRS and VSPO yield LLM-based TIR agents that generalize better across domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u2014\u2014\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\uff08PRS\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08VSPO\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1bPRS\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5bc6\u96c6\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u5347\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0cVSPO\u6539\u8fdbGRPO\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e8c\u8005\u8054\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u77ed/\u957f\u6587\u672c\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\uff08TIR\uff09\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08Agentic RL\uff09\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u4e8c\u5143\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\uff1b\u4e8c\u662fGRPO\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u52bf\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u68af\u5ea6\u9000\u5316\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6280\u672f\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\uff08PRS\uff09\uff1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5148\u9f13\u52b1\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u518d\u4f18\u5316\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u77ed\u95ee\u7b54\u91c7\u7528\u957f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5BLEU\uff0c\u957f\u95ee\u7b54\u91c7\u7528LLM-as-a-Judge\u8bc4\u5206\u9632\u6b62\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u3002\uff082\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08VSPO\uff09\uff1a\u6539\u8fdbGRPO\uff0c\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u4f9d\u636e\u517c\u987e\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4ef7\u503c\u6307\u6807\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4ef7\u503c\u5e73\u6ed1\u88c1\u526a\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u77ed/\u957f\u5f62\u5f0f\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cPRS\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u5143\u5956\u52b1\uff1bVSPO\u76f8\u6bd4PPO\u3001GRPO\u3001CISPO\u548cSFT\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u53ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4e8c\u8005\u8054\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM-TIR\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PRS\u4e0eVSPO\u534f\u540c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Agentic RL\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u9000\u5316\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

However, variability in patient populations, clinical practices, and electronic health record (EHR) systems across institutions introduces domain shifts that degrade the generalization performance of predictive models during deployment. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such shifts by adapting models dynamically during inference without requiring labeled target-domain data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Test-Time Training (AdaTTT), an enhanced TTT framework tailored for EHR-based IMV prediction in ICU settings. We begin by deriving information-theoretic bounds on the test-time prediction error and demonstrate that it is constrained by the uncertainty between the main and auxiliary tasks. To enhance their alignment, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework with pretext tasks: reconstruction and masked feature modeling optimized through a dynamic masking strategy that emphasizes features critical to the main task. Additionally, to improve robustness against domain shifts, we incorporate prototype learning and employ Partial Optimal Transport (POT) for flexible, partial feature alignment while maintaining clinically meaningful patient representations.

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated promising capabilities for end-to-end robot control, existing approaches still exhibit limited generalization to tasks beyond their training distributions. In contrast, humans possess remarkable proficiency in acquiring novel skills by simply observing others performing them once. Inspired by this capability, we propose ViVLA, a generalist robotic manipulation policy that achieves efficient task learning from a single expert demonstration video at test time. Our approach jointly processes an expert demonstration video alongside the robot's visual observations to predict both the demonstrated action sequences and subsequent robot actions, effectively distilling fine-grained manipulation knowledge from expert behavior and transferring it seamlessly to the agent. To enhance the performance of ViVLA, we develop a scalable expert-agent pair data generation pipeline capable of synthesizing paired trajectories from easily accessible human videos, further augmented by curated pairs from publicly available datasets. This pipeline produces a total of 892,911 expert-agent samples for training ViVLA.

Prior approaches attribute hallucinations to a binary conflict between internal knowledge (stored in FFNs) and retrieved context. However, this perspective is incomplete, failing to account for the impact of other components in the generative process, such as the user query, previously generated tokens, the current token itself, and the final LayerNorm adjustment. To address this, we introduce SPAD. First, we mathematically attribute each token's probability into seven distinct sources: Query, RAG, Past, Current Token, FFN, Final LayerNorm, and Initial Embedding. This attribution quantifies how each source contributes to the generation of the current token. Then, we aggregate these scores by POS tags to quantify how different components drive specific linguistic categories. By identifying anomalies, such as Nouns relying on Final LayerNorm, SPAD effectively detects hallucinations.

Existing methods often compromise visible imagery quality, impacting measurement accuracy. To solve this, we propose a region perception-based fusion framework that combines multi-exposure and multi-modal imaging using a spatially varying exposure (SVE) camera. This framework co-fuses multi-modal and multi-exposure data, overcoming single-exposure method limitations in extreme environments. The framework begins with region perception-based feature fusion to ensure precise multi-modal registration, followed by adaptive fusion with contrast enhancement. A structural similarity compensation mechanism, guided by regional saliency maps, optimizes IR-VIS spectral integration. Moreover, the framework adapts to single-exposure scenarios for robust fusion across different conditions.

Many defenses are typically either black-box guardrails that filter outputs, or internals-based methods that steer hidden activations by operationalizing safety as a single latent feature or dimension. While effective for simple concepts, this assumption is limiting, as recent evidence shows that abstract concepts such as refusal and temporality are distributed across multiple features rather than isolated in one. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs), which extends SAEs with a Laplacian smoothness penalty on the neuron co-activation graph. Unlike standard SAEs that assign each concept to a single latent feature, GSAEs recover smooth, distributed safety representations as coherent patterns spanning multiple features. We empirically demonstrate that GSAE enables effective runtime safety steering, assembling features into a weighted set of safety-relevant directions and controlling them with a two-stage gating mechanism that activates interventions only when harmful prompts or continuations are detected during generation. This approach enforces refusals adaptively while preserving utility on benign queries. Across safety and QA benchmarks, GSAE steering achieves an average 82% selective refusal rate, substantially outperforming standard SAE steering (42%), while maintaining strong task accuracy (70% on TriviaQA, 65% on TruthfulQA, 74% on GSM8K).

Previous efforts in representation learning do not attempt to jointly capture structured periodic patterns and irregular variations in human and animal movement. To address this, we present Multi-Domain Motion Embedding (MDME), a motion representation that unifies the embedding of structured and unstructured features using a wavelet-based encoder and a probabilistic embedding in parallel. This produces a rich representation of reference motions from a minimal input set, enabling improved generalization across diverse motion styles and morphologies. We evaluate MDME on retargeting-free real-time motion imitation by conditioning robot control policies on the learned embeddings, demonstrating accurate reproduction of complex trajectories on both humanoid and quadruped platforms. Our comparative studies confirm that MDME outperforms prior approaches in reconstruction fidelity and generalizability to unseen motions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MDME can reproduce novel motion styles in real-time through zero-shot deployment, eliminating the need for task-specific tuning or online retargeting.

Among them, next-scale prediction has emerged as a popular paradigm, where models generate images in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, scale-wise AR models suffer from exposure bias, which undermines generation quality. We identify two primary causes of this issue: (1) train-test mismatch, where the model must rely on its own imperfect predictions during inference, and (2) imbalance in scale-wise learning difficulty, where certain scales exhibit disproportionately higher optimization complexity. Through a comprehensive analysis of training dynamics, we propose Self-Autoregressive Refinement (SAR) to address these limitations. SAR introduces a Stagger-Scale Rollout (SSR) mechanism that performs lightweight autoregressive rollouts to expose the model to its own intermediate predictions, thereby aligning train-test patterns, and a complementary Contrastive Student-Forcing Loss (CSFL) that provides adequate supervision for self-generated contexts to ensure stable training. Experimental results show that applying SAR to pretrained AR models consistently improves generation quality with minimal computational overhead. For instance, SAR yields a 5.2% FID reduction on FlexVAR-d16 trained on ImageNet 256 within 10 epochs (5 hours on 32xA100 GPUs).

This simplification discards the imaginary component, which contains valuable phase information, leading to a potential loss of relational details crucial for modeling long-context dependencies. In this paper, we propose an extension that re-incorporates this discarded imaginary component. Our method leverages the full complex-valued representation to create a dual-component attention score. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that this approach enhances the modeling of long-context dependencies by preserving more positional information. Furthermore, evaluations on a suite of long-context language modeling benchmarks show that our method consistently improves performance over the standard RoPE, with the benefits becoming more significant as context length increases.

However, they may ignore effect of facial segmentation of FER. In this paper, we propose a perception CNN for FER as well as PCNN. Firstly, PCNN can use five parallel networks to simultaneously learn local facial features based on eyes, cheeks and mouth to realize the sensitive capture of the subtle changes in FER. Secondly, we utilize a multi-domain interaction mechanism to register and fuse between local sense organ features and global facial structural features to better express face images for FER. Finally, we design a two-phase loss function to restrict accuracy of obtained sense information and reconstructed face images to guarantee performance of obtained PCNN in FER. Experimental results show that our PCNN achieves superior results on several lab and real-world FER benchmarks: CK+, JAFFE, FER2013, FERPlus, RAF-DB and Occlusion and Pose Variant Dataset.

While comprehensive ensembles like HIVE-COTE 2.0 achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, their 340-hour training time on the UCR benchmark renders them impractical for large-scale datasets. We investigate whether targeted combinations of two efficient algorithms from complementary paradigms can capture ensemble benefits while maintaining computational feasibility. Combining Hydra (competing convolutional kernels) and Quant (hierarchical interval quantiles) across six ensemble configurations, we evaluate performance on 10 large-scale MONSTER datasets (7,898 to 1,168,774 training instances). Our strongest configuration improves mean accuracy from 0.829 to 0.836, succeeding on 7 of 10 datasets. However, prediction-combination ensembles capture only 11% of theoretical oracle potential, revealing a substantial meta-learning optimization gap. Feature-concatenation approaches exceeded oracle bounds by learning novel decision boundaries, while prediction-level complementarity shows moderate correlation with ensemble gains. The central finding: the challenge has shifted from ensuring algorithms are different to learning how to combine them effectively. Current meta-learning strategies struggle to exploit the complementarity that oracle analysis confirms exists. Improved combination strategies could potentially double or triple ensemble gains across diverse time series classification applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Hydra\u548cQuant\uff09\u6765\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982HIVE-COTE 2.0\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u8017\u65f6\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5Hydra\uff08\u591a\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u7ade\u4e89\uff09\u548cQuant\uff08\u5206\u5c42\u533a\u95f4\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u516d\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u914d\u7f6e\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u572810\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MONSTER\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u7ea7\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u62fc\u63a5\u53ca\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u4e0e\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece0.829\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.836\uff0c\u572810\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u76847\u4e2a\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec4\u5408\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bbaOracle\u6f5c\u529b\u768411%\uff1b\u7279\u5f81\u62fc\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8aOracle\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u7ea7\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u589e\u76ca\u5448\u4e2d\u7b49\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6311\u6218\u5df2\u4ece\u786e\u4fdd\u57fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u7ec4\u5408\u5b83\u4eec\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u95f4\u5df2\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff1b\u6539\u8fdb\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u671b\u4f7f\u96c6\u6210\u589e\u76ca\u7ffb\u500d\u6216\u4e09\u500d\u3002"}}

This inference delay creates a gap of tens to hundreds of milliseconds between the observed state and the state at execution. In this work, we take the natural generalization from zero delay to measured delay during training and inference. We introduce Delay-Aware Diffusion Policy (DA-DP), a framework for explicitly incorporating inference delays into policy learning. DA-DP corrects zero-delay trajectories to their delay-compensated counterparts, and augments the policy with delay conditioning. We empirically validate DA-DP on a variety of tasks, robots, and delays and find its success rate more robust to delay than delay-unaware methods. DA-DP is architecture agnostic and transfers beyond diffusion policies, offering a general pattern for delay-aware imitation learning.

However, as a standalone task it has received little attention. We address this by introducing SwissGov-RSD, the first naturalistic, document-level, cross-lingual dataset for semantic difference recognition. It encompasses a total of 224 multi-parallel documents in English-German, English-French, and English-Italian with token-level difference annotations by human annotators.

Current methods for articulated motion lie at a crossroads: they are either physically consistent but too slow for real-time use, or generative but violate basic kinematic constraints. We present DragMesh, a robust framework for real-time interactive 3D articulation built around a lightweight motion generation core. Our core contribution is a novel decoupled kinematic reasoning and motion generation framework. First, we infer the latent joint parameters by decoupling semantic intent reasoning (which determines the joint type) from geometric regression (which determines the axis and origin using our Kinematics Prediction Network (KPP-Net)). Second, to leverage the compact, continuous, and singularity-free properties of dual quaternions for representing rigid body motion, we develop a novel Dual Quaternion VAE (DQ-VAE). This DQ-VAE receives these predicted priors, along with the original user drag, to generate a complete, plausible motion trajectory. To ensure strict adherence to kinematics, we inject the joint priors at every layer of the DQ-VAE's non-autoregressive Transformer decoder using FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) conditioning. This persistent, multi-scale guidance is complemented by a numerically-stable cross-product loss to guarantee axis alignment. This decoupled design allows DragMesh to achieve real-time performance and enables plausible, generative articulation on novel objects without retraining, offering a practical step toward generative 3D intelligence.

However, this procedure is difficult because real-world datasets are rarely homogeneous; they consist of a mixture of diverse information, causing gradient interference, where conflicting gradients pull the model in opposing directions, degrading performance. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to group data based on semantic or embedding similarity. However, this fails to capture how data influences model parameters during learning. While recent works have attempted to cluster gradients directly, they randomly project gradients into lower dimensions to manage memory, which leads to accuracy loss. Moreover, these methods rely on expert ensembles which necessitates multiple inference passes and expensive on-the-fly gradient computations during inference. To address these limitations, we propose GradientSpace, a framework that clusters samples directly in full-dimensional gradient space. We introduce an online SVD-based algorithm that operates on LoRA gradients to identify latent skills without the infeasible cost of storing all sample gradients. Each cluster is used to train a specialized LoRA expert along with a lightweight router trained to select the best expert during inference. We show that routing to a single, appropriate expert outperforms expert ensembles used in prior work, while significantly reducing inference latency. Our experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, finance, and creative writing tasks demonstrate that GradientSpace leads to coherent expert specialization and consistent accuracy gains over state-of-the-art clustering methods and finetuning techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGradientSpace\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5168\u7ef4\u68af\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u7528LoRA\u4e13\u5bb6\u53ca\u8f7b\u91cf\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u6216\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u964d\u7ef4\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u9700\u591a\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGradientSpace\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u5728\u7ebfSVD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406LoRA\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5b58\u50a8\u5168\u90e8\u6837\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7ef4\u68af\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528LoRA\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u5668\u4ee5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cGradientSpace\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5355\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "GradientSpace\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5168\u7ef4\u68af\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u805a\u7c7b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6-\u8def\u7531\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u3002"}}

In this review, we examine the current state of the art in pHHI through three core pillars: (i) humanoid modeling and control, (ii) human intent estimation, and (iii) computational human models. For each pillar, we survey representative approaches, identify open challenges, and analyze current limitations that hinder robust, scalable, and adaptive interaction. These include the need for whole-body control strategies capable of handling uncertain human dynamics, real-time intent inference under limited sensing, and modeling techniques that account for variability in human physical states. Although significant progress has been made within each domain, integration across pillars remains limited. We propose pathways for unifying methods across these areas to enable cohesive interaction frameworks. This structure enables us not only to map the current landscape but also to propose concrete directions for future research that aim to bridge these domains. Additionally, we introduce a unified taxonomy of interaction types based on modality, distinguishing between direct interactions (e.g., physical contact) and indirect interactions (e.g., object-mediated), and on the level of robot engagement, ranging from assistance to cooperation and collaboration. For each category in this taxonomy, we provide the three core pillars that highlight opportunities for cross-pillar unification. Our goal is to suggest avenues to advance robust, safe, and intuitive physical interaction, providing a roadmap for future research that will allow humanoid systems to effectively understand, anticipate, and collaborate with human partners in diverse real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4eba-\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08pHHI\uff09\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u7c7b\u4eba\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e09\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u652f\u67f1\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8de8\u652f\u67f1\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dpHHI\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5404\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u652f\u67f1\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u76f4\u63a5/\u95f4\u63a5\uff09\u4e0e\u53c2\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff08\u8f85\u52a9/\u5408\u4f5c/\u534f\u4f5c\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u5404\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0b\u8de8\u652f\u67f1\u878d\u5408\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5404\u652f\u67f1\u5f53\u524d\u5c40\u9650\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4f4e\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u5b9e\u65f6\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8de8\u652f\u67f1\u7edf\u4e00\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u552f\u6709\u6253\u901a\u7c7b\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e09\u8005\u58c1\u5792\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u3002"}}

However, we observed that annotations dissimilar to the human annotation could achieve a higher model likelihood than the human annotation. We address this issue by applying Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to generative ESD models. Specifically, we employ sentence- and span-level similarity metrics as utility functions to select candidate hypotheses based on their approximate similarity to the human annotation. Extensive experimental results show that our MBR decoding outperforms the MAP baseline at the system, sentence, and span-levels.

For such purpose, we present a dual-path transformer framework that leverages CLIP to jointly model visual and attribute-driven cues for gender recognition at a distance. The framework integrates two complementary streams: (1) a direct visual path that refines a pre-trained CLIP image encoder through selective fine-tuning of its upper layers, and (2) an attribute-mediated path that infers gender from a set of soft-biometric prompts (e.g., hairstyle, clothing, accessories) aligned in the CLIP text-image space. Spatial channel attention modules further enhance discriminative localization under occlusion and low resolution. To support large-scale evaluation, we construct U-DetAGReID, a unified long-range gender dataset derived from DetReIDx and AG-ReID.v2, harmonized under a consistent ternary labeling scheme (Male, Female, Unknown). Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed solution surpasses state-of-the-art person-attribute and re-identification baselines across multiple metrics (macro-F1, accuracy, AUC), with consistent robustness to distance, angle, and height variations. Qualitative attention visualizations confirm interpretable attribute localization and responsible abstention behavior.

In this paper, we uncover a misalignment between original and distilled datasets, observing that a high-quality original dataset does not necessarily yield a superior synthetic dataset. Through an empirical analysis of policy performance under varying levels of training loss, we show that datasets with greater state diversity outperforms those with higher state quality when training loss is substantial, as is often the case in OBD, whereas the relationship reverses under minimal loss, which contributes to the misalignment. By associating state quality and diversity in reducing pivotal and surrounding error, respectively, our theoretical analysis establishes that surrounding error plays a more crucial role in policy performance when pivotal error is large, thereby highlighting the importance of state diversity in OBD scenario. Furthermore, we propose a novel yet simple algorithm, state density weighted (SDW) OBD, which emphasizes state diversity by weighting the distillation objective using the reciprocal of state density, thereby distilling a more diverse state information into synthetic data. Extensive experiments across multiple D4RL datasets confirm that SDW significantly enhances OBD performance when the original dataset exhibits limited state diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u79bb\u7ebf\u884c\u4e3a\u84b8\u998f\uff08OBD\uff09\u4e2d\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u5e76\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u597d\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6bd4\u72b6\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\uff08SDW\uff09\u7684OBD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3OBD\u4e2d\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728 misalignment \u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u672a\u5fc5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u72b6\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\uff08SDW\uff09OBD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u72b6\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5012\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6743\u91cd\u8c03\u6574\u84b8\u998f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aD4RL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u72b6\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u9650\u65f6\uff0cSDW\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347OBD\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728OBD\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6bd4\u72b6\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff1bSDW\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u9f13\u52b1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u4e0e\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9519\u4f4d\u3002"}}

As autonomy requires reasoning and planning on multiple scales of the environment, each algorithm may require a different map for optimal performance. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors generate an abundance of geometric data to satisfy these diverse requirements, but selecting informative, size-constrained maps is computationally challenging as it requires solving an NP-hard combinatorial optimization. In this work we present OptMap: a geometric map distillation algorithm which achieves real-time, application-specific map generation via multiple theoretical and algorithmic innovations. A central feature is the maximization of set functions that exhibit diminishing returns, i.e., submodularity, using polynomial-time algorithms with provably near-optimal solutions. We formulate a novel submodular reward function which quantifies informativeness, reduces input set sizes, and minimizes bias in sequentially collected datasets. Further, we propose a dynamically reordered streaming submodular algorithm which improves empirical solution quality and addresses input order bias via an online approximation of the value of all scans. Testing was conducted on open-source and custom datasets with an emphasis on long-duration mapping sessions, highlighting OptMap's minimal computation requirements.

However, most of those results have not been tested explicitly for reproducibility and might be prone to biases in the study samples or models.

In this study, we test the robustness of a recent study on sound symbolism of basic vocabulary concepts which analyzed245 languages.The new sample includes data on 2864 languages from Lexibank. We modify the original model by adding statistical controls for spatial and phylogenetic dependencies between languages. The new results show that most of the previously observed patterns are not robust, and in fact many patterns disappear completely when adding the genealogical and areal controls. A small number of patterns, however, emerges as highly stable even with the new sample.

We present a fully automated deep-learning approach to estimate five key anthropometric measurements from 2D synthetic human body images. Using a dataset of 100,000 images derived from 3D body meshes, we trained and evaluated VGG19, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 with fully connected layers for regression. All models achieved sub-centimeter accuracy, with ResNet50 performing best, achieving a mean MAE of 0.668 cm across all measurements.

The quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM), inspired by its classical counterpart, has been proposed as a promising framework for quantum generative learning. QuDDPM is capable of efficiently learning and generating quantum data, and it demonstrates excellent performance in learning correlated quantum noise models, quantum many-body phases, and the topological structure of quantum data. However, we show that barren plateaus emerge in QuDDPMs due to the use of 2-design states as the input for the denoising process, which severely undermines the performance of QuDDPM. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we confirm the presence of barren plateaus in the original QuDDPM. To address this issue, we introduce an improved QuDDPM that utilizes a distribution maintaining a certain distance from the Haar distribution, ensuring better trainability.

However, existing persona-based dialogue datasets lack explicit relations between persona sentences and responses, which makes it difficult for models to effectively capture persona information. To address these issues, we propose MoCoRP (Modeling Consistent Relations between Persona and Response), a framework that incorporates explicit relations into language models. MoCoRP leverages an NLI expert to explicitly extract the NLI relations between persona sentences and responses, enabling the model to effectively incorporate appropriate persona information from the context into its responses. We applied this framework to pre-trained models like BART and further extended it to modern large language models (LLMs) through alignment tuning. Experimental results on the public datasets ConvAI2 and MPChat demonstrate that MoCoRP outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior persona consistency and engaging, context-aware dialogue generation. Furthermore, our model not only excels in quantitative metrics but also shows significant improvements in qualitative aspects. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling persona-response relations in persona-based dialogue.

Existing approaches based on implicit representations like NeRFs suffer from slow rendering and dynamic inconsistencies, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods are typically limited to static head generation, lacking dynamic control. We bridge this gap by introducing AGORA, a novel framework that extends 3DGS within a generative adversarial network to produce animatable avatars. Our key contribution is a lightweight, FLAME-conditioned deformation branch that predicts per-Gaussian residuals, enabling identity-preserving, fine-grained expression control while allowing real-time inference. Expression fidelity is enforced via a dual-discriminator training scheme leveraging synthetic renderings of the parametric mesh. AGORA generates avatars that are not only visually realistic but also precisely controllable. Quantitatively, we outperform state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on expression accuracy while rendering at 250+ FPS on a single GPU, and, notably, at $\\sim$9 FPS under CPU-only inference - representing, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of practical CPU-only animatable 3DGS avatar synthesis. This work represents a significant step toward practical, high-performance digital humans.

The framework supports both translational and rotational motions, which are fundamental to co-transport scenarios. It comprises three components: a high-level planner, a low-level controller, and a stiffness modulation mechanism. At the planning level, we introduce the Interaction Linear Inverted Pendulum (I-LIP), which, combined with an admittance model and an MPC formulation, generates dynamically feasible footstep plans. These are executed by a QP-based whole-body controller that accounts for the coupled humanoid-object dynamics. Stiffness modulation regulates robot-object interaction, ensuring convergence to the desired relative configuration defined by the distance between the object and the robot's center of mass. We validate the effectiveness of the framework through real-world experiments conducted on the Digit humanoid platform. To quantify collaboration quality, we propose an efficiency metric that captures both task performance and inter-agent coordination. We show that this metric highlights the role of compliance in collaborative tasks and offers insights into desirable trajectory characteristics across both high- and low-level control layers. Finally, we showcase experimental results on collaborative behaviors, including translation, turning, and combined motions such as semi circular trajectories, representative of naturally occurring co-transportation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u642c\u8fd0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eI-LIP\u4e0eMPC\uff09\u3001\u4f4e\u5c42QP\u5168\u8eab\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ca\u521a\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Digit\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u53ca\u590d\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u642c\u8fd0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u4eba-\u7269-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u4ea4\u4e92\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInteraction Linear Inverted Pendulum (I-LIP)\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u5bfc\u7eb3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eMPC\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6b65\u6001\uff1b\u91c7\u7528QP-based\u5168\u8eab\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u521a\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5668\u4eba-\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u521a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u76f8\u5bf9\u6784\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Digit\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u8f6c\u5411\u53ca\u534a\u5706\u5f62\u7b49\u590d\u5408\u534f\u540c\u642c\u8fd0\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u642c\u8fd0\uff1b\u521a\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u4fdd\u969c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u9ad8/\u4f4e\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

We assess the performance of SafeTerm Automated Medical Query (AMQ) on MedDRA SMQs. The AMQ is a novel quantitative artificial intelligence system that understands and processes medical terminology and automatically retrieves relevant MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) for a given input query, ranking them by a relevance score (0-1) using multi-criteria statistical methods. The system (SafeTerm) embeds medical query terms and MedDRA PTs in a multidimensional vector space, then applies cosine similarity, and extreme-value clustering to generate a ranked list of PTs. Validation was conducted against tier-1 SMQs (110 queries, v28.1). Precision, recall and F1 were computed at multiple similarity-thresholds, defined either manually or using an automated method. High recall (94%)) is achieved at moderate similarity thresholds, indicative of good retrieval sensitivity. Higher thresholds filter out more terms, resulting in improved precision (up to 89%). The optimal threshold (0.70)) yielded an overall recall of (48%) and precision of (45%) across all 110 queries. Restricting to narrow-term PTs achieved slightly better performance at an increased (+0.05) similarity threshold, confirming increased relatedness of narrow versus broad terms. The automatic threshold (0.66) selection prioritizes recall (0.58) to precision (0.29). SafeTerm AMQ achieves comparable, satisfactory performance on SMQs and sanitized OCMQs.

Multimodal automatic depression detection (ADD) offers a promising solution; however, widely studied audio- and video-based ADD methods lack a unified, generalizable framework for diverse depression recognition scenarios and show limited stability to missing modalities, which are common in real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for Stable Cross-Domain Depression Recognition based on Multimodal Large Language Model (SCD-MLLM). The framework supports the integration and processing of heterogeneous depression-related data collected from varied sources while maintaining stability in the presence of incomplete modality inputs. Specifically, SCD-MLLM introduces two key components: (i) Multi-Source Data Input Adapter (MDIA), which employs masking mechanism and task-specific prompts to transform heterogeneous depression-related inputs into uniform token sequences, addressing inconsistency across diverse data sources; (ii) Modality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Module (MAFM), which adaptively integrates audio and visual features via a shared projection mechanism, enhancing resilience under missing modality conditions. e conduct comprehensive experiments under multi-dataset joint training settings on five publicly available and heterogeneous depression datasets from diverse scenarios: CMDC, AVEC2014, DAIC-WOZ, DVlog, and EATD. Across both complete and partial modality settings, SCD-MLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models as well as leading commercial LLMs (Gemini and GPT), demonstrating superior cross-domain generalization, enhanced ability to capture multimodal cues of depression, and strong stability to missing modality cases in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8de8\u57df\u6291\u90c1\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff08SCD-MLLM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff08MDIA\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08MAFM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5546\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u97f3\u9891/\u89c6\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6291\u90c1\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08ADD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCD-MLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a(i) \u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff08MDIA\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3atoken\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b(ii) \u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08MAFM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u516c\u5f00\u6291\u90c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08CMDC\u3001AVEC2014\u3001DAIC-WOZ\u3001DVlog\u3001EATD\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "SCD-MLLM\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u6a21\u578b\u53caGemini\u3001GPT\u7b49\u5546\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6291\u90c1\u7ebf\u7d22\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SCD-MLLM\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u591a\u6e90\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u7b5b\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7AI\u4e2d\u7684\u843d\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Rolling-element bearings are among the most frequent causes of machinery failure, highlighting the need for robust RUL estimation methods. Existing approaches often suffer from poor generalization, lack of robustness, high data demands, and limited interpretability. This paper proposes a novel multimodal-RUL framework that jointly leverages image representations (ImR) and time-frequency representations (TFR) of multichannel, nonstationary vibration signals. The architecture comprises three branches: (1) an ImR branch and (2) a TFR branch, both employing multiple dilated convolutional blocks with residual connections to extract spatial degradation features; and (3) a fusion branch that concatenates these features and feeds them into an LSTM to model temporal degradation patterns. A multi-head attention mechanism subsequently emphasizes salient features, followed by linear layers for final RUL regression. To enable effective multimodal learning, vibration signals are converted into ImR via the Bresenham line algorithm and into TFR using Continuous Wavelet Transform. We also introduce multimodal Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (multimodal-LRP), a tailored explainability technique that significantly enhances model transparency. The approach is validated on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA benchmark datasets.

A classical issue with the fusion of many embeddings from audio with text is the large length of the audio sequence compared to the text one. Our method benefits from an existing speech tokenizer trained for Audio Speech Recognition that output long sequences of tokens from a large vocabulary, making it difficult to integrate it at low cost in a large language model. By applying a simple lasso-based feature selection on multimodal Bag-of-Words representation, we retain only the most important audio tokens for the task, and adapt the language model to them with a self-supervised language modeling objective, before fine-tuning it on the downstream task. We show this helps to improve the performances compared to an unimodal model, to a bigger SpeechLM or to integrating audio via a learned representation. We show the effectiveness of our method on two recent Argumentative Fallacy Detection and Classification tasks where the use of audio was believed counterproductive, reaching state-of-the-art results. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the method, showing that even a random audio token selection helps enhancing the unimodal model.

To address this limitation, this work presents Sanvaad, a lightweight multimodal accessibility framework designed to support real time, two-way communication. For deaf users, Sanvaad includes an ISL recognition module built on MediaPipe landmarks. MediaPipe is chosen primarily for its efficiency and low computational load, enabling the system to run smoothly on edge devices without requiring dedicated hardware. Spoken input from a phone can also be translated into sign representations through a voice-to-sign component that maps detected speech to predefined phrases and produces corresponding GIFs or alphabet-based visualizations. For visually impaired users, the framework provides a screen free voice interface that integrates multilingual speech recognition, text summarization, and text-to-speech generation. These components work together through a Streamlit-based interface, making the system usable on both desktop and mobile environments.

Deep learning (DL) approaches provide the most accurate solutions for this purpose. However, they suffer from complexity problem due to the massive number of parameters, in addition to the high forecasting error at the extreme points. In this work, an effective method to alleviate the error at these points is proposed. It is based on extending the data by inserting virtual data within the actual data to relieve the nonlinearity around them. To our knowledge, this is the first work that considers the problem related to the extreme points. Moreover, the water demand forecasting model proposed in this work is a novel DL model with relatively low complexity. The basic model uses the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to handle the sequential relationship in the historical demand data, while an unsupervised classification method, K-means, is introduced for the creation of new features to enhance the prediction accuracy with less number of parameters. Real data obtained from two different water plants in China are used to train and verify the model proposed.

The goal of this study is to design, develop, and validate a comprehensive, multi-modal system that fully automates the monitoring workflow, from data acquisition to the generation of actionable, geo-located maintenance alerts, thereby enhancing plant safety and operational efficiency. The methods employed involve a synergistic architecture that begins with a palette-invariant thermal embedding, learned by enforcing representational consistency, which is fused with a contrast-normalized RGB stream via a gated mechanism. This is supplemented by a closed-loop, adaptive re-acquisition controller that uses Rodrigues-based updates for targeted confirmation of ambiguous anomalies and a geospatial deduplication module that clusters redundant alerts using DBSCAN over the haversine distance. In conclusion, this study establishes a powerful new paradigm for proactive PV inspection, with the proposed system achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.903 on the public PVF-10 benchmark, a significant 12-15% improvement over single-modality baselines. Field validation confirmed the system's readiness, achieving 96% recall, while the de-duplication process reduced duplicate-induced false positives by 15-20%, and relevance-only telemetry cut airborne data transmission by 60-70%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5149\u4f0f\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u91cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u4f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u70ed\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u9700\u6c42\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u70ed\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u3001RGB\u4e0e\u70ed\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eRodrigues\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u91c7\u96c6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eDBSCAN\u4e0ehaversine\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u91cd\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728PVF-10\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0amAP@0.5\u8fbe0.903\uff08\u8f83\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534712\u201315%\uff09\uff1b\u5b9e\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe96%\uff1b\u53bb\u91cd\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u8bef\u62a515\u201320%\uff1b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9065\u6d4b\u4f7f\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u964d\u4f4e60\u201370%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u5149\u4f0f\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5df2\u5177\u5907\u5de5\u7a0b\u843d\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While conventional convolutional architectures such as EEGNet and DeepConvNet are effective in capturing local spatial patterns, they are markedly less suited for modeling long-range temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics. To address this limitation, we integrate an Echo State Network (ESN), a prominent paradigm in reservoir computing into the decoding pipeline. ESNs construct a high-dimensional, sparsely connected recurrent reservoir that excels at tracking temporal dynamics, thereby complementing the spatial representational power of CNNs. Evaluated on a skateboard-trick EEG dataset preprocessed via the PREP pipeline and implemented in MNE-Python, our ESNNet achieves 83.2% within-subject and 51.3% LOSO accuracies, surpassing widely used CNN-based baselines.

These interactions can range from minor disturbances, such as raccoons in urban waste bins, to more severe consequences, including species extinction. As a result, the monitoring of wildlife is gaining significance in various contexts. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a solution by automating the recognition of animals in images and videos, thereby reducing the manual effort required for wildlife monitoring. Traditional AI training involves three main stages: image collection, labelling, and model training. However, the variability, for example, in the landscape (e.g., mountains, open fields, forests), weather (e.g., rain, fog, sunshine), lighting (e.g., day, night), and camera-animal distances presents significant challenges to model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios.\n  In this work, we propose a unified framework, called ShadowWolf, designed to address these challenges by integrating and optimizing the stages of AI model training and evaluation. The proposed framework enables dynamic model retraining to adjust to changes in environmental conditions and application requirements, thereby reducing labelling efforts and allowing for on-site model adaptation. This adaptive and unified approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of wildlife monitoring systems, promoting more effective and scalable conservation efforts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aShadowWolf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2dAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u73b0\u573a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u6816\u606f\u5730\u7f29\u51cf\u548c\u4eba\u517d\u63a5\u89e6\u589e\u591a\u4f7f\u5f97\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edfAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08\u5730\u5f62\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u5149\u7167\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShadowWolf\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5e76\u4f18\u5316AI\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u73b0\u573a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u56fe\u50cf/\u89c6\u9891\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ShadowWolf\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

The KV cache grows with sequence length and embedding dimension, often exceeding the memory footprint of the model itself and limiting achievable batch sizes and context windows. To address this challenge, we present KV CAR, a unified and architecture agnostic framework that significantly reduces KV cache storage while maintaining model fidelity. KV CAR combines two complementary techniques. First, a lightweight autoencoder learns compact representations of key and value tensors along the embedding dimension, compressing them before they are stored in the KV cache and restoring them upon retrieval. Second, a similarity driven reuse mechanism identifies opportunities to reuse KV tensors of specific attention heads across adjacent layers. Together, these methods reduce the dimensional and structural redundancy in KV tensors without requiring changes to the transformer architecture. Evaluations on GPT 2 and TinyLLaMA models across Wikitext, C4, PIQA, and Winogrande datasets demonstrate that KV CAR achieves up to 47.85 percent KV cache memory reduction with minimal impact on perplexity and zero shot accuracy. System level measurements on an NVIDIA A40 GPU show that the reduced KV footprint directly translates into longer sequence lengths and larger batch sizes during inference. These results highlight the effectiveness of KV CAR in enabling memory efficient LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faKV CAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u538b\u7f29KV\u7f13\u5b58\u53ca\u8de8\u5c42\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684KV\u5f20\u91cf\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u952e\u503c\uff08KV\uff09\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5e38\u8d85\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u3002", "method": "KV CAR\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6cbf\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u952e\u503c\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b58\u50a8\u524d\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u540e\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u590d\u7528\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u90bb\u5c42\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684KV\u5f20\u91cf\u590d\u7528\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-2\u548cTinyLLaMA\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKV CAR\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1147.85% KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5bf9\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff1bNVIDIA A40 GPU\u5b9e\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u6279\u6b21\u3002", "conclusion": "KV CAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Despite encouraging results, most existing research focuses on acquisition patterns optimized for a single dataset or modality, with limited consideration of their transferability across imaging domains. In this work, we demonstrate that the benefits of learned k-space sampling can extend beyond the training domain, enabling superior reconstruction performance under domain shifts. Our study presents two main contributions. First, through systematic evaluation across datasets and acquisition paradigms, we show that models trained with learned sampling patterns exhibitimproved generalization under cross-domain settings. Second, we propose a novel method that enhances domain robustness by introducing acquisition uncertainty during training-stochastically perturbing k-space trajectories to simulate variability across scanners and imaging conditions. Our results highlight the importance of treating kspace trajectory design not merely as an acceleration mechanism, but as an active degree of freedom for improving domain generalization in MRI reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u578bk\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf\uff08MRI\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8k\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578bk\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u6a21\u6001\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u8de8\u91c7\u96c6\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8k\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u626b\u63cf\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "k\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u52a0\u901f\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u63d0\u5347MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Firstly, we design four HoloLens 2-based EEG classes and collect EEG data from seven healthy subjects for analysis. Secondly, we build upon the conventional CNN-BiLSTM architecture by integrating a multi-head attention mechanism (MACNN-BiLSTM). We extract ten temporal-spectral EEG features and feed them into a CNN to learn high-level representations. Then, we use BiLSTM to model sequential dependencies and apply a multi-head attention mechanism to highlight motor-intention-related patterns. Finally, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method is applied to visualize EEG feature contributions to the neural network's decision-making process, enhancing the model's interpretability.

However, their reliance on linearized token sequences limits their ability to understand the structural semantics of programs. While prior studies have explored graphaugmented prompting and structure-aware pretraining, they either suffer from prompt length constraints or require task-specific architectural changes that are incompatible with large-scale instructionfollowing LLMs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CGBridge, a novel plug-and-play method that enhances LLMs with Code Graph information through an external, trainable Bridge module. CGBridge first pre-trains a code graph encoder via selfsupervised learning on a large-scale dataset of 270K code graphs to learn structural code semantics. It then trains an external module to bridge the modality gap among code, graph, and text by aligning their semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. Finally, the bridge module generates structure-informed prompts, which are injected into a frozen LLM, and is fine-tuned for downstream code intelligence tasks.

Brain tumors can be detected by the radiologist manually from the MRI scan images of the patients. However, the incidence of brain tumors has risen amongst children and adolescents in recent years, resulting in a substantial volume of data, as a result, it is time-consuming and difficult to detect manually. With the emergence of Artificial intelligence in the modern world and its vast application in the medical field, we can make an approach to the CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) system for the early detection of Brain tumors automatically. All the existing models for this task are not completely generalized and perform poorly on the validation data. So, we have proposed two novel Deep Learning Architectures - (a) SAETCN (Self-Attention Enhancement Tumor Classification Network) for the classification of different kinds of brain tumors. We have achieved an accuracy of 99.38% on the validation dataset making it one of the few Novel Deep learning-based architecture that is capable of detecting brain tumors accurately. We have trained the model on the dataset, which contains images of 3 types of tumors (glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors) and non-tumor cases. and (b) SAS-Net (Self-Attentive Segmentation Network) for the accurate segmentation of brain tumors.

The evaluation is conducted initially on a non-convex benchmark function and subsequently on a real-world ML dataset. The initial comparative study using the Adam optimiser is conducted on a stochastic variant of the highly non-convex and notoriously challenging Rosenbrock function, renowned for its narrow, curved valley, across dimensions ranging from 2D to 1000D and an extreme case of 50,000D. Two configurations were evaluated to eliminate learning-rate bias: (i) both using ArcGD's effective learning rate and (ii) both using Adam's default learning rate. ArcGD consistently outperformed Adam under the first setting and, although slower under the second, achieved super ior final solutions in most cases. In the second evaluation, ArcGD is evaluated against state-of-the-art optimizers (Adam, AdamW, Lion, SGD) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset across 8 diverse MLP architectures ranging from 1 to 5 hidden layers. ArcGD achieved the highest average test accuracy (50.7%) at 20,000 iterations, outperforming AdamW (46.6%), Adam (46.8%), SGD (49.6%), and Lion (43.4%), winning or tying on 6 of 8 architectures. Notably, while Adam and AdamW showed strong early convergence at 5,000 iterations, but regressed with extended training, whereas ArcGD continued improving, demonstrating generalization and resistance to overfitting without requiring early stopping tuning. Strong performance on geometric stress tests and standard deep-learning benchmarks indicates broad applicability, highlighting the need for further exploration. Moreover, it is also shown that a variant of ArcGD can be interpreted as a special case of the Lion optimiser, highlighting connections between the inherent mechanisms of such optimisation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ArcGD\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\uff08Rosenbrock\uff09\u548cCIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u67b6\u6784MLP\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eAdam\u3001AdamW\u3001Lion\u548cSGD\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982Adam\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u957f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArcGD\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5728Rosenbrock\u51fd\u6570\uff082D\u201350,000D\uff09\u548cCIFAR-10\uff088\u79cdMLP\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0eAdam\u3001AdamW\u3001Lion\u3001SGD\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u63a7\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u53d8\u91cf\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0eLion\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "ArcGD\u5728Rosenbrock\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d85\u8d8aAdam\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u9ad8\u7ef4\uff09\uff1b\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe50.7%\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u57286/8\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u80dc\u51fa\u6216\u6301\u5e73\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3aLion\u7279\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "ArcGD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u5f3a\u3001\u6297\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6781\u975e\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u672c\u8d28\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002"}}

Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation.

However, existing segmentation models often struggle to effectively capture local and global contextual information, leading to boundary pixel loss and segmentation errors. In this paper, we propose U-CycleMLP, a novel U-shaped encoder-decoder network designed to enhance segmentation performance while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The encoder learns multiscale contextual features using position attention weight excitation blocks, dense atrous blocks, and downsampling operations, effectively capturing both local and global contextual information. The decoder reconstructs high-resolution segmentation masks through upsampling operations, dense atrous blocks, and feature fusion mechanisms, ensuring precise boundary delineation. To further refine segmentation predictions, channel CycleMLP blocks are incorporated into the decoder along the skip connections, enhancing feature integration while maintaining linear computational complexity relative to input size. Experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of U-CycleMLP in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, achieving better segmentation accuracy across all datasets, capturing fine-grained anatomical structures, and demonstrating robustness across different medical imaging modalities.

Concurrently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering superior parameter efficiency and interpretability. To mitigate KANs' computational overhead, variants like FastKAN leverage Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to accelerate inference. In this work, we investigate integrating KAN architectures into the DreamerV3 framework. We introduce KAN-Dreamer, replacing specific MLP and convolutional components of DreamerV3 with KAN and FastKAN layers. To ensure efficiency within the JAX-based World Model, we implement a tailored, fully vectorized version with simplified grid management. We structure our investigation into three subsystems: Visual Perception, Latent Prediction, and Behavior Learning.

While these models often produce linguistically coherent output, they often suffer from hallucinations, generating descriptions that are factually inconsistent with the visual content, potentially leading to adverse consequences. Therefore, the assessment of hallucinations in MLLM has become increasingly crucial in the model development process. Contemporary methodologies predominantly depend on external LLM evaluators, which are themselves susceptible to hallucinations and may present challenges in terms of domain adaptation. In this study, we propose the hypothesis that hallucination manifests as measurable irregularities within the internal layer dynamics of MLLMs, not merely due to distributional shifts but also in the context of layer-wise analysis of specific assumptions. By incorporating such modifications, \\textsc{\\textsc{HalluShift++}} broadens the efficacy of hallucination detection from text-based large language models (LLMs) to encompass multimodal scenarios.

However, this progress raises urgent questions around user consent and the ability to remove specific individuals from a model's output space. We address this by introducing SUGAR, a framework for scalable generative unlearning that enables the removal of many identities (simultaneously or sequentially) without retraining the entire model. Rather than projecting unwanted identities to unrealistic outputs or relying on static template faces, SUGAR learns a personalized surrogate latent for each identity, diverting reconstructions to visually coherent alternatives while preserving the model's quality and diversity. We further introduce a continual utility preservation objective that guards against degradation as more identities are forgotten. SUGAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing up to 200 identities, while delivering up to a 700% improvement in retention utility compared to existing baselines.

Since market participants are usually uncertain about their preferences in various online matching platforms, an emerging line of research is dedicated to the online setting where one-side participants (players) learn their unknown preferences through multiple rounds of interactions with the other side (arms). Sankararaman et al. provide an $\u03a9\\left( \\frac{N\\log(T)}{\u0394^2} + \\frac{K\\log(T)}\u0394 \\right)$ regret lower bound for this problem under serial dictatorship assumption, where $N$ is the number of players, $K (\\geq N)$ is the number of arms, $\u0394$ is the minimum reward gap across players and arms, and $T$ is the time horizon. Serial dictatorship assumes arms have the same preferences, which is common in reality when one side participants have a unified evaluation standard. Recently, the work of Kong and Li proposes the ET-GS algorithm and achieves an $O\\left( \\frac{K\\log(T)}{\u0394^2} \\right)$ regret upper bound, which is the best upper bound attained so far. Nonetheless, a gap between the lower and upper bounds, ranging from $N$ to $K$, persists. It remains unclear whether the lower bound or the upper bound needs to be improved. In this paper, we propose a multi-level successive selection algorithm that obtains an $O\\left( \\frac{N\\log(T)}{\u0394^2} + \\frac{K\\log(T)}\u0394 \\right)$ regret bound when the market satisfies serial dictatorship.

SAM 3 supports zero-shot segmentation across a wide range of prompts, including point, bounding box, and language-based prompts, allowing for more flexible and intuitive interactions with the model. In this empirical evaluation, we assess the performance of SAM 3 in robot-assisted surgery, benchmarking its zero-shot segmentation with point and bounding box prompts and exploring its effectiveness in dynamic video tracking, alongside its newly introduced language prompt segmentation. While language prompts show potential, their performance in the surgical domain is currently suboptimal, highlighting the need for further domain-specific training. Additionally, we investigate SAM 3's 3D reconstruction abilities, demonstrating its capacity to process surgical scene data and reconstruct 3D anatomical structures from 2D images. Through comprehensive testing on the MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and EndoVis 2018 benchmarks, SAM 3 shows clear improvements over SAM and SAM 2 in both image and video segmentation under spatial prompts, while zero-shot evaluations on SCARED, StereoMIS, and EndoNeRF indicate strong monocular depth estimation and realistic 3D instrument reconstruction, yet also reveal remaining limitations in complex, highly dynamic surgical scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9SAM 3\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u96f6-shot\u5206\u5272\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u51763D\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf/\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u65b0Segment Anything Model (SAM 3)\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u8fd9\u4e00\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u65b0\u589e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u5272\u4e0e3D\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u5916\u79d1\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u5728MICCAI EndoVis 2017/2018\u3001SCARED\u3001StereoMIS\u548cEndoNeRF\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\u5916\u79d1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9SAM 3\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6-shot\u5206\u5272\uff08\u70b9\u3001\u6846\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53ca3D\u91cd\u5efa\uff08\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u5efa\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eSAM\u548cSAM 2\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "SAM 3\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u70b9\u3001\u6846\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8eSAM\u548cSAM 2\uff1b\u5177\u5907\u521d\u6b65\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e3D\u5668\u68b0\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4f46\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM 3\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5272\u548c3D\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u5916\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u5c55\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

The system (SafeTerm) embeds medical query terms and MedDRA PTs in a multidimensional vector space, then applies cosine similarity and extreme-value clustering to generate a ranked list of PTs. Validation was conducted against the FDA OCMQ v3.0 (104 queries), restricted to valid MedDRA PTs. Precision, recall and F1 were computed across similarity-thresholds. High recall (>95%) is achieved at moderate thresholds. Higher thresholds improve precision (up to 86%). The optimal threshold (~0.70 - 0.75) yielded recall ~50% and precision ~33%.

To effectively model such objects, it is essential to recover both part segmentation and the underlying joint parameters. Despite the importance of this task, previous work has largely focused on setups like multi-view systems, object scanning, or static cameras. In this paper, we present the first data-driven approach that jointly predicts part segmentation and joint parameters from monocular video captured with a freely moving camera. Trained solely on synthetic data, our method demonstrates strong generalization to real-world objects, offering a scalable and practical solution for articulated object understanding. Our approach operates directly on casually recorded video, making it suitable for real-time applications in dynamic environments.

A probing study finds that LLMs' internal representations can reliably identify incoherent narratives. However, LLMs generate responses to rating questions that fail to satisfactorily separate the coherent and incoherent narratives across several prompt variations, hinting at a gap in LLM's understanding of storytelling. The reasoning LLMs tested do not eliminate these deficits, indicating that thought strings may not be able to fully address the discrepancy between model internal state and behavior. Additionally, we find that LLMs appear to be more sensitive to incoherence resulting from an event that violates the setting (e.g., a rainy day in the desert) than to incoherence arising from a character violating an established trait (e.g., Mary, a vegetarian, later orders a cheeseburger), suggesting that LLMs may rely more on prototypical world knowledge than building meaning-based narrative coherence.

While an improved ConvNeXt Tiny architecture, integrating Global Average and Max Pooling fusion (GAGM), lightweight channel attention (SEVector), and Feature Smoothing Loss (FSL), demonstrated promising results on Alzheimer MRI under CPU friendly conditions, our work investigates its transposability to mammography classification. Using a Kaggle dataset that consolidates INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM mammography collections, we compare a baseline CNN, ConvNeXt Tiny, and InceptionV3 backbones enriched with GAGM and SEVector modules. Results confirm the effectiveness of GAGM and SEVector in enhancing feature discriminability and reducing false negatives, particularly for malignant cases. In our experiments, however, the Feature Smoothing Loss did not yield measurable improvements under mammography classification conditions, suggesting that its effectiveness may depend on specific architectural and computational assumptions. Beyond validation, our contribution extends the original framework through multi metric evaluation (macro F1, per class recall variance, ROC/AUC), feature interpretability analysis (Grad CAM), and the development of an interactive dashboard for clinical exploration.

Transactions on Machine Learning Research, 2025", "summary": "Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning addresses classification problems where only a subset of positive examples is labeled and the remaining data is unlabeled, making explicit negative supervision unavailable. Existing PU methods often rely on negative-risk estimation or pseudo-labeling, which either require strong distributional assumptions or can collapse in high-dimensional settings. We propose AngularPU, a novel PU framework that operates on the unit hypersphere using cosine similarity and angular margin. In our formulation, the positive class is represented by a learnable prototype vector, and classification reduces to thresholding the cosine similarity between an embedding and this prototype-eliminating the need for explicit negative modeling. To counteract the tendency of unlabeled embeddings to cluster near the positive prototype, we introduce an angular regularizer that encourages dispersion of the unlabeled set over the hypersphere, improving separation. We provide theoretical guarantees on the Bayes-optimality of the angular decision rule, consistency of the learned prototype, and the effect of the regularizer on the unlabeled distribution. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AngularPU achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art PU methods, particularly in settings with scarce positives and high-dimensional embeddings, while offering geometric interpretability and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AngularPU\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u65b0\u578bPU\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u6b63\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u89d2\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u6563\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PU\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8d1f\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u9700\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "AngularPU\u5c06\u6837\u672c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5355\u4f4d\u8d85\u7403\u9762\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u578b\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u6b63\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e3a\u5224\u522b\u4f9d\u636e\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u89d2\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u8feb\u4f7f\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u5728\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u5747\u5300\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u805a\u96c6\u4e8e\u6b63\u539f\u578b\u9644\u8fd1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAngularPU\u5728\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18PU\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AngularPU\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8d1f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u6548\u7684PU\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u548c\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We present UltrasODM, a dual-stream framework that assists sonographers during acquisition through calibrated per-frame uncertainty, saliency-based diagnostics, and actionable prompts. UltrasODM integrates (i) a contrastive ranking module that groups frames by motion similarity, (ii) an optical-flow stream fused with Dual-Mamba temporal modules for robust 6-DoF pose estimation, and (iii) a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) layer combining Bayesian uncertainty, clinician-calibrated thresholds, and saliency maps highlighting regions of low confidence. When uncertainty exceeds the threshold, the system issues unobtrusive alerts suggesting corrective actions such as re-scanning highlighted regions or slowing the sweep. Evaluated on a clinical freehand ultrasound dataset, UltrasODM reduces drift by 15.2%, distance error by 12.1%, and Hausdorff distance by 10.1% relative to UltrasOM, while producing per-frame uncertainty and saliency outputs.

A central challenge is the lack of control in modern training pipelines: large-scale pre-training corpora are opaque, mid-training is often underexamined, and RL objectives interact with unknown prior knowledge in complex ways. To resolve this ambiguity, we develop a fully controlled experimental framework that isolates the causal contributions of pre-training, mid-training, and RL-based post-training. Our approach employs synthetic reasoning tasks with explicit atomic operations, parseable step-by-step reasoning traces, and systematic manipulation of training distributions. We evaluate models along two axes: extrapolative generalization to more complex compositions and contextual generalization across surface contexts. Using this framework, we reconcile competing views on RL's effectiveness. We show that: 1) RL produces true capability gains (pass@128) only when pre-training leaves sufficient headroom and when RL data target the model's edge of competence, tasks at the boundary that are difficult but not yet out of reach. 2) Contextual generalization requires minimal yet sufficient pre-training exposure, after which RL can reliably transfer. 3) Mid-training significantly enhances performance under fixed compute compared with RL only, demonstrating its central but underexplored role in training pipelines. 4) Process-level rewards reduce reward hacking and improve reasoning fidelity. Together, these results clarify the interplay between pre-training, mid-training, and RL, offering a foundation for understanding and improving reasoning LM training strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1aRL\u4ec5\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7559\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e14RL\u6570\u636e\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\u624d\u5e26\u6765\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6cdb\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u5ea6\u4f46\u5145\u5206\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u66b4\u9732\uff1b\u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7528RL\uff1b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6240\u8d4b\u4e88\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a7\u5236\u6027\uff08\u5982\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3001\u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3001RL\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea4\u4e92\u590d\u6742\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5398\u6e05\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u539f\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u64cd\u63a7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u4ece\u5916\u63a8\u6cdb\u5316\uff08\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6cdb\u5316\uff08\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "1) RL\u4ec5\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7559\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u2018\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u2019\u4e14RL\u6570\u636e\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u771f\u5b9e\u7684pass@128\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u76ca\uff1b2) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6cdb\u5316\u53ea\u9700\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u5ea6\u4f46\u5145\u5206\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u4e4b\u540eRL\u5373\u53ef\u53ef\u9760\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b3) \u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b97\u529b\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eafRL\uff1b4) \u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u6291\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0eRL\u4e09\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5206\u5de5\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\uff1a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u5e76\u8bbe\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u529b\uff0cRL\u5219\u5728\u6070\u5f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To address this, we first introduce \\textbf{MedVidBench}, a large-scale benchmark of 531,850 video-instruction pairs across 8 medical sources spanning video, segment, and frame-level tasks, curated through a rigorous quality assurance pipeline with expert-guided prompting and dual-model validation. While supervised fine-tuning on MedVidBench yields noticeable gains, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) fails due to imbalanced reward scales across datasets, which destabilizes optimization and leads to training collapse. To overcome this, we introduce \\textbf{MedGRPO}, a novel RL framework for balanced multi-dataset training with two key innovations: (1) \\emph{cross-dataset reward normalization} that maps each dataset's median performance to a common reward value, ensuring fair optimization regardless of difficulty, and (2) a \\emph{medical LLM judge} that evaluates caption quality on five clinical dimensions through comparative similarity scoring. Supervised fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MedVidBench substantially outperforms GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash across all tasks, demonstrating MedVidBench's efficacy, while our MedGRPO framework further improves upon the SFT baseline across grounding and captioning tasks. Our work establishes a foundational benchmark and robust training methodology for advancing vision-language models in medical domains.

We introduce Small-Gain Nash (SGN), a block small-gain condition in a custom block-weighted geometry. SGN converts local curvature and cross-player Lipschitz coupling bounds into a tractable certificate of contraction. It constructs a weighted block metric in which the pseudo-gradient becomes strongly monotone on any region where these bounds hold, even when it is non-monotone in the Euclidean sense. The continuous flow is exponentially contracting in this designed geometry, and projected Euler and RK4 discretizations converge under explicit step-size bounds derived from the SGN margin and a local Lipschitz constant. Our analysis reveals a certified ``timescale band'', a non-asymptotic, metric-based certificate that plays a TTUR-like role: rather than forcing asymptotic timescale separation via vanishing, unequal step sizes, SGN identifies a finite band of relative metric weights for which a single-step-size dynamics is provably contractive. We validate the framework on quadratic games where Euclidean monotonicity analysis fails to predict convergence, but SGN successfully certifies it, and extend the construction to mirror/Fisher geometries for entropy-regularized policy gradient in Markov games. The result is an offline certification pipeline that estimates curvature, coupling, and Lipschitz parameters on compact regions, optimizes block weights to enlarge the SGN margin, and returns a structural, computable convergence certificate consisting of a metric, contraction rate, and safe step-sizes for non-monotone games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Small-Gain Nash\uff08SGN\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u5757\u52a0\u6743\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u8de8\u73a9\u5bb6Lipschitz\u8026\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6307\u6570\u6536\u655b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u663e\u5f0f\u6b65\u957f\u754c\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u535a\u5f08\u68af\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f2a\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u6b27\u6c0f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u7684\uff08\u5f3a\uff09\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u5e38\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5757\u5c0f\u589e\u76ca\uff08Small-Gain Nash, SGN\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5757\u52a0\u6743\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4f2a\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f3a\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u8de8\u73a9\u5bb6Lipschitz\u8026\u5408\u4e0a\u754c\u6784\u9020\u52a0\u6743\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u4e0e\u6b27\u62c9/\u9f99\u683c-\u5e93\u5854\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684\u6307\u6570\u6536\u7f29\u6027\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u7531SGN\u88d5\u91cf\u548c\u5c40\u90e8Lipschitz\u5e38\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u6b65\u957f\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5e26\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6536\u655b\u8ba4\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728SGN\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f2a\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u6b27\u6c0f\u610f\u4e49\u4e0b\u975e\u5355\u8c03\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u4ecd\u6307\u6570\u6536\u7f29\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u6b27\u62c9\u4e0eRK4\u79bb\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u6b65\u957f\uff1b\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6b27\u6c0f\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u65f6\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u955c\u50cf/Fisher\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u53ef\u79bb\u7ebf\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "SGN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u535a\u5f08\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u3001\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u53ca\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda and organizing framework for decision-support agents: systems designed as partners in cognitive work, maintaining evolving models of how particular experts reason, helping articulate and revise goals, co-constructing and stress-testing causal hypotheses, and learning from the outcomes of joint decisions so that both human and agent improve over time. We sketch challenges around training ecologies that make collaborative thinking instrumentally valuable, representations and interaction protocols for co-authored models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity.

The system utilizes Cyanobacterial Index data from the Cyanobacterial Assessment Network and temperature data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellites to capture long range dependencies and sequential dynamics in satellite time series. The dataset is very sparse, missing more than 30% of the Cyanobacterial Index data and 90% of the temperature data. A two stage preprocessing pipeline addressed data gaps by applying forward fill and weighted temporal imputation at the pixel level, followed by smoothing to reduce the discontinuities of CyanoHAB events. The raw dataset is transformed into meaningful features through equal frequency binning for the Cyanobacterial Index values and extracted temperature statistics. Transformer BiLSTM model demonstrates strong forecasting performance across multiple horizons, achieving F1 scores of 89.5%, 86.4%, and 85.5% at one, two, and three-day forecasts, respectively, and maintaining an F1 score of 78.9% with an AUC of 82.6% at the 14-day horizon. These results confirm the model's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse satellite data and to provide reliable early warning for CyanoHABs management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u4e0eBiLSTM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u536b\u661f\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u84dd\u85fb\u6307\u6570\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\uff09\u63d0\u524d14\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u84dd\u85fb\u6c34\u534e\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728Lake Champlain\u533a\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684F1\u548cAUC\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u84dd\u85fb\u6709\u5bb3\u6c34\u534e\uff08CyanoHABs\uff09\u5bf9\u6c34\u751f\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u516c\u5171\u5065\u5eb7\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u800cLake Champlain\u5317\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u56e0\u5bcc\u8425\u517b\u5316\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u7387\u6613\u53d1\u6b64\u7c7b\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b\u5b9e\u5730\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9065\u611f\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u4e0eBiLSTM\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff1a\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u524d\u5411\u586b\u5145\u4e0e\u52a0\u6743\u65f6\u95f4\u63d2\u8865\uff0c\u518d\u5e73\u6ed1\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u5bf9\u84dd\u85fb\u6307\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7b49\u9891\u5206\u7bb1\u3001\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ea6\u63d0\u53d6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4e3aCyanobacterial Index\uff08CyAN\uff09\u4e0eMODIS\u6e29\u5ea6\u536b\u661f\u65f6\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u57281/2/3\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2dF1\u8fbe89.5%/86.4%/85.5%\uff0c14\u5929\u9884\u6d4b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301F1 78.9%\u3001AUC 82.6%\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u9065\u611f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4e3a\u84dd\u85fb\u6c34\u534e\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6c34\u4f53\u3002"}}

While data-driven methods have advanced predictive modeling for forward design, inverse design, which focuses on determining mix compositions that achieve target performance, remains limited, particularly in design situations where some mix variables are fixed by constraints and only the remaining variables must be determined. This study proposes a cooperative neural network framework for the partial inverse design of high-performance concrete. The framework combines two coupled neural network models, an imputation model that infers the undetermined variables and a surrogate model that predicts compressive strength. Through cooperative learning, the model generates valid and performance-consistent mix designs in a single forward pass while accommodating different constraint combinations without retraining. Its performance is compared with both probabilistic and generative approaches, including Bayesian inference based on a Gaussian process surrogate and autoencoder-based models. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the proposed model achieves stable and higher R-squared values of 0.87-0.92 and reduces mean squared error by an average of 50 percent compared with autoencoder baselines and by an average of 70 percent compared with Bayesian inference. The results demonstrate that the cooperative neural network provides an accurate, robust, and computationally efficient foundation for constraint-aware, data-driven mix proportioning in concrete engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534f\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63a8\u65ad\u672a\u5b9a\u7ec4\u5206\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u6297\u538b\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5f3a\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u6b63\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5df2\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u5206\u56fa\u5b9a\uff09\u7684\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u8026\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u586b\u8865\u672a\u5b9a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6297\u538b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u914d\u6bd4\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aR\u00b2\u8fbe0.87\u20130.92\uff0c\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e50%\uff0c\u8f83\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u964d\u4f4e70%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u534f\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u914d\u6bd4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate whether OOD generalisation results generalise. More specifically, we evaluate a model's performance across multiple OOD testsets throughout a finetuning run; we then evaluate the partial correlation of performances across these testsets, regressing out in-domain performance. This allows us to assess how correlated are generalisation performances once in-domain performance is controlled for.

Point-wise loss functions have been widely used to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and absolute gene expression values. However, due to the complexity of the sequencing techniques and intrinsic variability across cells, the observed gene expression contains stochastic noise and batch effects, and estimating the absolute expression values accurately remains a significant challenge. To mitigate this, we propose a novel objective of learning relative expression patterns rather than absolute levels. We assume that the relative expression levels of genes exhibit consistent patterns across independent experiments, even when absolute expression values are affected by batch effects and stochastic noise in tissue samples. Based on the assumption, we model the relation and propose a novel loss function called STRank that is robust to noise and batch effects.

As the core component of the train operation system, the health of bearings is directly related to the safety of train operation. The traditional diagnostic methods are facing the challenge of insufficient diagnostic accuracy under complex conditions. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Neural Factorization-based Classification (NFC) framework for bearing fault diagnosis. It is built on two core idea: 1) Embedding vibration time series into multiple mode-wise latent feature vectors to capture diverse fault-related patterns; 2) Leveraging neural factorization principles to fuse these vectors into a unified vibration representation. This design enables effective mining of complex latent fault characteristics from raw time-series data. We further instantiate the framework with two models CP-NFC and Tucker-NFC based on CP and Tucker fusion schemes, respectively. Experimental results show that both models achieve superior diagnostic performance compared with traditional machine learning methods. The comparative analysis provides valuable empirical evidence and practical guidance for selecting effective diagnostic strategies in high-speed train bearing monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff08NFC\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901f\u5217\u8f66\u8f74\u627f\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u632f\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5206\u89e3\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6316\u6398\u590d\u6742\u6545\u969c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u901f\u5217\u8f66\u8f74\u627f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u4ef6\uff0c\u5176\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd0\u884c\u5b89\u5168\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bca\u65ad\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u7c7b\uff08NFC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u632f\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5206\u89e3\u539f\u7406\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u5f62\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u632f\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eCP\u4e0eTucker\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u522b\u6784\u5efaCP-NFC\u548cTucker-NFC\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "CP-NFC\u548cTucker-NFC\u5728\u8f74\u627f\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "NFC\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u590d\u6742\u6f5c\u5728\u6545\u969c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u901f\u5217\u8f66\u8f74\u627f\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Submitted as course project", "summary": "Accurate taxonomic identification of diatoms is essential for aquatic ecosystem monitoring, yet conventional methods depend heavily on expert taxonomists. Recent deep learning approaches improve automation, but most treat diatom recognition as flat classification predicting only one taxonomic rank. We investigate whether embedding taxonomic hierarchy into neural network architectures can improve both accuracy and error locality.\n  We introduce a hierarchical convolutional network with five cascaded heads that jointly predict class, order, family, genus, and species. Each head receives shared backbone features and probability distributions from higher levels, with binary masks restricting predictions to valid descendants during training and inference. Using a filtered dataset of 1,456 diatom images covering 82 species, we compare hierarchical and flat models under identical settings.\n  The hierarchical model matches flat baselines at species level (69.4% accuracy) while outperforming at all upper taxonomic levels. When species predictions fail, errors remain taxonomically local: 92.5 % of misclassified species are correctly predicted at genus level, versus 67.2% for flat baselines. The hierarchical model reduces mean taxonomic distance by 38.2% (1.209 vs. 1.955).\n  Progressive training reveals bidirectional mechanisms: hierarchical constraint masks operate top-down to constrain prediction space, while gradients from fine-grained levels propagate bottom-up through the shared backbone, refining features. This improves class accuracy from 96.2% to 99.5% and yields 6-8% gains at upper levels, producing more robust, interpretable, and biologically aligned predictions for multi-level taxonomic classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7ea7\u7845\u85fb\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u79cd\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e0a\u66f4\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7845\u85fb\u9274\u5b9a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u5355\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u751f\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e94\u7ea7\u7ea7\u8054\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u79cd\u3001\u5c5e\u3001\u79d1\u3001\u76ee\u3001\u7eb2\uff09\uff0c\u5404\u5c42\u7ea7\u5171\u4eab\u9aa8\u5e72\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u63a5\u6536\u4e0a\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u4e8c\u503c\u63a9\u7801\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u572882\u4e2a\u7269\u79cd\u51711456\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7269\u79cd\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe69.4%\uff08\u4e0e\u6241\u5e73\u6a21\u578b\u6301\u5e73\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5c5e\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\uff1b92.5%\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u8bef\u5224\u4ecd\u6b63\u786e\u81f3\u5c5e\u7ea7\uff08\u6241\u5e73\u6a21\u578b\u4ec567.2%\uff09\uff1b\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e38.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u5c42\u7ea7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5230\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7269\u79cd\u9274\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A key component of trust is explainability, yet much of the work in Explainable RL (XRL) focuses on local, single-step decisions. This paper addresses the critical need for explaining an agent's long-term behavior through trajectory-level analysis. We introduce a novel framework that ranks entire trajectories by defining and aggregating a new state-importance metric. This metric combines the classic Q-value difference with a \"radical term\" that captures the agent's affinity to reach its goal, providing a more nuanced measure of state criticality. We demonstrate that our method successfully identifies optimal trajectories from a heterogeneous collection of agent experiences. Furthermore, by generating counterfactual rollouts from critical states within these trajectories, we show that the agent's chosen path is robustly superior to alternatives, thereby providing a powerful \"Why this, and not that?\" explanation. Our experiments in standard OpenAI Gym environments validate that our proposed importance metric is more effective at identifying optimal behaviors compared to classic approaches, offering a significant step towards trustworthy autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Q\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u503e\u5411\u6027\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6700\u4f18\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u6f14\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08XRL\uff09\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b65\u5c40\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5373\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u6574\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7ecf\u5178Q\u503c\u5dee\u4e0e\u8868\u5f81\u76ee\u6807\u503e\u5411\u6027\u7684'\u6fc0\u8fdb\u9879'\uff0c\u5e76\u6cbf\u8f68\u8ff9\u805a\u5408\u4ee5\u6392\u5e8f\u6574\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4ece\u5173\u952e\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e rollout \u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenAI Gym\u6807\u51c6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u5f02\u6784\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u9009\u8def\u5f84\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on simulated strong-lensing images from the DeepLense ML4SCI benchmark to learn generalizable representations for two downstream tasks: (i) classifying the underlying dark matter model (cold dark matter, axion-like, or no substructure) and (ii) enhancing low-resolution lensed images via super-resolution. We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that MAE pretraining on physics-rich simulations provides a flexible, reusable encoder for multiple strong-lensing analysis tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08MAE\uff09\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528DeepLense\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ViT\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u6d4b\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728DeepLense ML4SCI\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9Vision Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884cMAE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u5206\u522b\u5fae\u8c03\u7528\u4e8e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u51b7\u6697\u7269\u8d28/\u7c7b\u8f74\u5b50/\u65e0\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\uff0816\u00d716\u219264\u00d764\uff09\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u63a9\u7801\u6bd4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "90%\u63a9\u7801\u6bd4\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8fAUC\u8fbe0.968\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf0.957\uff09\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u738788.65%\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf82.46%\uff09\uff1b\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8PSNR\u7ea633 dB\uff0cSSIM 0.961\uff0c\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u9ad8\u63a9\u7801\u6bd4\u5229\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u4f46\u8f7b\u5fae\u635f\u5bb3\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "MAE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, most directly rely on native Transformer attention layers as encoders without evaluating their cross-domain limitations and inherent shortcomings: forgetting important information or focusing on irrelevant representations when modeling long-range dependencies for text detection. The recently proposed state space model Mamba has demonstrated better long-range dependencies modeling through a linear complexity selection mechanism. Therefore, we propose a novel scene text detector based on Mamba that integrates the selection mechanism with attention layers, enhancing the encoder's ability to extract relevant information from long sequences. We adopt the Top\\_k algorithm to explicitly select key information and reduce the interference of irrelevant information in Mamba modeling.

These attacks commonly occur through fraudulent messages, misleading advertisements, and compromised legitimate websites. This study proposes a Quantile Regression Deep Q-Network (QR-DQN) approach that integrates RoBERTa semantic embeddings with handcrafted lexical features to enhance phishing detection while accounting for uncertainties. Unlike traditional DQN methods that estimate single scalar Q-values, QR-DQN leverages quantile regression to model the distribution of returns, improving stability and generalization on unseen phishing data. A diverse dataset of 105,000 URLs was curated from PhishTank, OpenPhish, Cloudflare, and other sources, and the model was evaluated using an 80/20 train-test split. The QR-DQN framework achieved a test accuracy of 99.86%, precision of 99.75%, recall of 99.96%, and F1-score of 99.85%, demonstrating high effectiveness. Compared to standard DQN with lexical features, the hybrid QR-DQN with lexical and semantic features reduced the generalization gap from 1.66% to 0.04%, indicating significant improvement in robustness. Five-fold cross-validation confirmed model reliability, yielding a mean accuracy of 99.90% with a standard deviation of 0.04%.

This leads to substantial variability in image descriptions. However, existing models for personalized image description focus on linguistic style alone, with no prior work leveraging individual viewing patterns. We address this gap by explicitly modeling personalized viewing behavior as a core factor in description generation. Our method, DEPER (DEscription-PERception persona encoder), learns a subject embedding that captures both linguistic style and viewing behavior, guided by an auxiliary attention-prediction task. A lightweight adapter aligns these embeddings with a frozen vision-language model, enabling few-shot personalization without retraining. Across four datasets spanning diverse viewing tasks and both short and detailed descriptions, DEPER achieves a 24% average improvement, showing that modeling personalized attention produces more human-aligned and high-quality descriptions.

Among these, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architectures are particularly effective in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, the robustness and generalization of such models are highly sensitive to input data characteristics - an aspect that remains underexplored in existing literature. This study presents a systematic empirical analysis of two key data-centric factors: input sequence length and additive noise. To support this investigation, a modular and reproducible forecasting pipeline is developed, incorporating standardized preprocessing, sequence generation, model training, validation, and evaluation. Controlled experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets with varying sampling frequencies to assess BiLSTM performance under different input conditions. The results yield three key findings: (1) longer input sequences significantly increase the risk of overfitting and data leakage, particularly in data-constrained environments; (2) additive noise consistently degrades predictive accuracy across sampling frequencies; and (3) the simultaneous presence of both factors results in the most substantial decline in model stability.

AdaMamba begins with an Adaptive Normalization Block that removes non stationary components through multi scale convolutional trend extraction and channel wise recalibration, enabling consistent detrending and variance stabilization. The normalized sequence is then processed by a Context Encoder that combines patch wise embeddings, positional encoding, and a Mamba enhanced Transformer layer with a mixture of experts feed forward module, allowing efficient modeling of both long range dependencies and local temporal dynamics. A lightweight prediction head generates multi horizon forecasts, and a denormalization mechanism reconstructs outputs by reintegrating local trends to ensure robustness under varying temporal conditions. AdaMamba provides strong representational capacity with modular extensibility, supporting deterministic prediction and compatibility with probabilistic extensions. Its design effectively mitigates covariate shift and enhances predictive reliability across heterogeneous datasets.

To achieve this, current MLLMs primarily treats bounding boxes as text tokens and generates them autoregressively. However, such autoregressive spatial decoding leads to very-long output sequences, causing spatial errors to accumulated over time and the localization results to progressively drift across a video. To address this, we present a Detector-Empowered Video LLM, short for DEViL, which couples a Video LLM with an open-vocabulary detector (OVD). Specifically, the MLLM and detector are connected via a reference-semantic token (RST) that distills the user query into a rich semantic representation. Unlike tokens that merely serve as spatial prompts or segmentor switches, the RST functions as both a control signal and a replacement for the OVD's text embedding, enabling end-to-end learning of both referential understanding and spatial localization. Furthermore, we propose a tube-mined temporal regularization (TTReg) within OVD, which drives the OVD to generate temporally-consistent queries for target objects, thereby ensuring effective temporal association. Experiments demonstrate that DEViL achieves strong performance across various fine-grained video understanding tasks, particularly STVG and GroundedVQA.

However, evaluation integrity is often compromised by data leakage, a methodological flaw in which input-output sequences are constructed before dataset partitioning, allowing future information to unintentionally influence training. This study investigates the impact of data leakage on performance, focusing on how validation design mediates leakage sensitivity. Three widely used validation techniques (2-way split, 3-way split, and 10-fold cross-validation) are evaluated under both leaky (pre-split sequence generation) and clean conditions, with the latter mitigating leakage risk by enforcing temporal separation during data splitting prior to sequence construction. The effect of leakage is assessed using RMSE Gain, which measures the relative increase in RMSE caused by leakage, computed as the percentage difference between leaky and clean setups. Empirical results show that 10-fold cross-validation exhibits RMSE Gain values of up to 20.5% at extended lag steps. In contrast, 2-way and 3-way splits demonstrate greater robustness, typically maintaining RMSE Gain below 5% across diverse configurations. Moreover, input window size and lag step significantly influence leakage sensitivity: smaller windows and longer lags increase the risk of leakage, whereas larger windows help reduce it. These findings underscore the need for configuration-aware, leakage-resistant evaluation pipelines to ensure reliable performance estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5bf9LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e0e\u975e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u914d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u6297\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982LSTM\uff09\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff08\u5373\u5148\u6784\u9020\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\u518d\u5212\u5206\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff082\u6298\u30013\u6298\u548c10\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\u5728\u2018\u6cc4\u6f0f\u2019\uff08\u9884\u5206\u5272\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e0e\u2018\u5e72\u51c0\u2019\uff08\u5148\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u518d\u6784\u9020\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RMSE Gain\u91cf\u5316\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u6ede\u540e\u6b65\u957f\u5bf9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "10\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u957f\u6ede\u540e\u6b65\u957f\u4e0bRMSE Gain\u9ad8\u8fbe20.5%\uff0c\u800c2\u6298\u548c3\u6298\u5206\u5272\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff08RMSE Gain\u901a\u5e38<5%\uff09\uff1b\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u5927\u6ede\u540e\u6b65\u957f\u52a0\u5267\u6cc4\u6f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5927\u7a97\u53e3\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u9a8c\u8bc1\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u914d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6297\u6cc4\u6f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u6027\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose RunawayEvil, the first multimodal jailbreak framework for I2V models with dynamic evolutionary capability. Built on a \"Strategy-Tactic-Action\" paradigm, our framework exhibits self-amplifying attack through three core components: (1) Strategy-Aware Command Unit that enables the attack to self-evolve its strategies through reinforcement learning-driven strategy customization and LLM-based strategy exploration; (2) Multimodal Tactical Planning Unit that generates coordinated text jailbreak instructions and image tampering guidelines based on the selected strategies; (3) Tactical Action Unit that executes and evaluates the multimodal coordinated attacks. This self-evolving architecture allows the framework to continuously adapt and intensify its attack strategies without human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate RunawayEvil achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on commercial I2V models, such as Open-Sora 2.0 and CogVideoX.

Foulds"], "title": "A Unifying Human-Centered AI Fairness Framework", "comment": null, "summary": "The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical societal domains has amplified concerns about fairness, particularly regarding unequal treatment across sensitive attributes such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. While there has been substantial work on ensuring AI fairness, navigating trade-offs between competing notions of fairness as well as predictive accuracy remains challenging, creating barriers to the practical deployment of fair AI systems. To address this, we introduce a unifying human-centered fairness framework that systematically covers eight distinct fairness metrics, formed by combining individual and group fairness, infra-marginal and intersectional assumptions, and outcome-based and equality-of-opportunity (EOO) perspectives. This structure allows stakeholders to align fairness interventions with their values and contextual considerations. The framework uses a consistent and easy-to-understand formulation for all metrics to reduce the learning curve for non-experts. Rather than privileging a single fairness notion, the framework enables stakeholders to assign weights across multiple fairness objectives, reflecting their priorities and facilitating multi-stakeholder compromises.

Existing deep learning methods seek to restore isotropy by leveraging lateral priors, yet their assumptions break down for morphologically anisotropic structures. We present EMGauss, a general framework for 3D reconstruction from planar scanned 2D slices with applications in vEM, which circumvents the inherent limitations of isotropy-based approaches. Our key innovation is to reframe slice-to-3D reconstruction as a 3D dynamic scene rendering problem based on Gaussian splatting, where the progression of axial slices is modeled as the temporal evolution of 2D Gaussian point clouds. To enhance fidelity in data-sparse regimes, we incorporate a Teacher-Student bootstrapping mechanism that uses high-confidence predictions on unobserved slices as pseudo-supervisory signals. Compared with diffusion- and GAN-based reconstruction methods, EMGauss substantially improves interpolation quality, enables continuous slice synthesis, and eliminates the need for large-scale pretraining.

In this context, we first show that a classical algorithm naturally satisfies LDP and then design two new algorithms that improve it: RW-AdaBatch and RW-Meta. For RW-AdaBatch, we exploit the limited-switching behavior induced by LDP to provide a novel form of privacy amplification that grows stronger on easier data, analogous to the shuffle model in offline learning. Drawing on the theory of random walks, we prove that this improvement carries essentially no utility cost. For RW-Meta, we develop a general method for privately selecting between experts that are themselves non-trivial learning algorithms, and we show that in the context of LDP this carries no extra privacy cost. In contrast, prior work has only considered data-independent experts. We also derive formal regret bounds that scale inversely with the degree of independence between experts. Our analysis is supplemented by evaluation on real-world data reported by hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic; RW-Meta outperforms both the classical baseline and a state-of-the-art \\textit{central} DP algorithm by 1.5-3$\\times$ on the task of predicting which hospital will report the highest density of COVID patients each week.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08LDP\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5RW-AdaBatch\u548cRW-Meta\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7528\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9eCOVID-19\u533b\u9662\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08LDP\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRW-AdaBatch\uff08\u5229\u7528LDP\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4f4e\u5207\u6362\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\uff09\u548cRW-Meta\uff08\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u9009\u62e9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u6094\u754c\u3002", "result": "RW-Meta\u5728\u771f\u5b9eCOVID-19\u533b\u9662\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316DP\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa1.5\u20133\u500d\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff1bRW-AdaBatch\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u653e\u5927\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u6094\u754c\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728LDP\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5982\u5229\u7528\u5207\u6362\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u5143\u7ea7\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\uff09\u53ef\u517c\u987e\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Efficiently solving this problem has implications ranging from pharmaceuticals to organic semiconductors, as crystal packing directly governs the physical and chemical properties of organic solids. In this paper, we introduce OXtal, a large-scale 100M parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale OXtal, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies. We further propose a novel crystallization-inspired lattice-free training scheme, Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling ($S^4$), that efficiently captures long-range interactions while sidestepping explicit lattice parametrization -- thus enabling more scalable architectural choices at all-atom resolution. By leveraging a large dataset of 600K experimentally validated crystal structures (including rigid and flexible molecules, co-crystals, and solvates), OXtal achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements over prior ab initio machine learning CSP methods, while remaining orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional quantum-chemical approaches. Specifically, OXtal recovers experimental structures with conformer $\\text{RMSD}_1<0.5$ \u00c5 and attains over 80\\% packing similarity rate, demonstrating its ability to model both thermodynamic and kinetic regularities of molecular crystallization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OXtal\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece2D\u5316\u5b66\u56fe\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b3D\u5206\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u6676\u683c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565S\u2074\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u76843D\u5206\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff08CSP\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u5236\u836f\u548c\u6709\u673a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u6676\u4f53\u5806\u79ef\u76f4\u63a5\u51b3\u5b9a\u6709\u673a\u56fa\u4f53\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOXtal\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a1\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u653e\u5f03\u663e\u5f0f\u7b49\u53d8\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6676\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65e0\u6676\u683c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling\uff08S\u2074\uff09\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u6676\u683c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u752860\u4e07\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "OXtal\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08conformer RMSD\u2081 < 0.5 \u00c5\uff09\u548c\u5806\u79ef\u76f8\u4f3c\u7387\uff08>80%\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdc\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60CSP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "OXtal\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6676\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Often, this source domain dataset has a distinct distribution to the clients' domains. To address the challenges posed by the FFreeDA setup, adaptation of the Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) methods to FL struggles with client-drift in real-world scenarios due to extreme data heterogeneity caused by the aforementioned domain gaps, resulting in unreliable pseudo-labels.

To probe the core issue, we conduct an empirical analysis and observe two characteristic behaviors: (i) fine-tuning VLMs on high-level semantic supervision strengthens semantic discrimination and well generalize to unseen data; (ii) fine-tuning VLMs on low-level pixel-artifact supervision yields poor transfer. We attribute VLMs' underperformance to task-model misalignment: semantics-oriented VLMs inherently lack sensitivity to fine-grained pixel artifacts, and semantically non-discriminative pixel artifacts thus exceeds their inductive biases. In contrast, we observe that conventional pixel-artifact detectors capture low-level pixel artifacts yet exhibit limited semantic awareness relative to VLMs, highlighting that distinct models are better matched to distinct tasks. In this paper, we formalize AIGI detection as two complementary tasks--semantic consistency checking and pixel-artifact detection--and show that neglecting either induces systematic blind spots. Guided by this view, we introduce the Task-Model Alignment principle and instantiate it as a two-branch detector, AlignGemini, comprising a VLM fine-tuned exclusively with pure semantic supervision and a pixel-artifact expert trained exclusively with pure pixel-artifact supervision. By enforcing orthogonal supervision on two simplified datasets, each branch trains to its strengths, producing complementary discrimination over semantic and pixel cues. On five in-the-wild benchmarks, AlignGemini delivers a +9.5 gain in average accuracy, supporting task-model alignment as an effective path to generalizable AIGI detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5c06AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u4f2a\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668AlignGemini\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7531\u8bed\u4e49\u5bfc\u5411\u7684VLM\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53479.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0VLM\u64c5\u957f\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u522b\u4f46\u5bf9\u4f4e\u7ea7\u50cf\u7d20\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u50cf\u7d20\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u4efb\u52a1-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u2019\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5c06AIGI\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u4f2a\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668AlignGemini\uff1a\u4e00\u652f\u7528\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03VLM\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u652f\u7528\u7eaf\u50cf\u7d20\u4f2a\u5f71\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u50cf\u7d20\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u4e24\u5206\u652f\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u53d1\u6325\u5404\u81ea\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAlignGemini\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347+9.5%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AIGI\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5e94\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u9700\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u5339\u914d\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u6b63\u4ea4\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1-\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The main driver of our unlearning methods is the similarity of predictions to a retrained model on both the forget and remain samples. We introduce Adversarial Machine UNlearning (AMUN), which surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods for image classification based on SOTA MIA scores. AMUN lowers the model's confidence on forget samples by fine-tuning on their corresponding adversarial examples. Through theoretical analysis, we identify factors governing AMUN's performance, including smoothness. To facilitate training of smooth models with a controlled Lipschitz constant, we propose FastClip, a scalable method that performs layer-wise spectral-norm clipping of affine layers. In a separate study, we show that increased smoothness naturally improves adversarial example transfer, thereby supporting the second factor above.\n  Following the same principles for class unlearning, we show that existing methods fail in replicating a retrained model's behavior by introducing a nearest-neighbor membership inference attack (MIA-NN) that uses the probabilities assigned to neighboring classes to detect unlearned samples and demonstrate the vulnerability of such methods. We then propose a fine-tuning objective that mitigates this leakage by approximating, for forget-class inputs, the distribution over remaining classes that a model retrained from scratch would produce. To construct this approximation, we estimate inter-class similarity and tilt the target model's distribution accordingly. The resulting Tilted ReWeighting(TRW) distribution serves as the desired target during fine-tuning. Across multiple benchmarks, TRW matches or surpasses existing unlearning methods on prior metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aAMUN\u7528\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u9057\u5fd8\uff0cTRW\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5747\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u903c\u8fd1\u6765\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6837\u672c\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5c42\u9762\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIA\uff09\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMUN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165FastClip\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u95f4\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u88c1\u526a\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236Lipschitz\u5e38\u6570\uff1b\u63d0\u51faTRW\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u503e\u659c\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u9057\u5fd8\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "AMUN\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0aSOTA MIA\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bTRW\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u903c\u8fd1\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\uff1bAMUN\u4e0eTRW\u5206\u522b\u4ece\u6837\u672c\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While most existing systems operate in a turn-based manner where the model can only reply after user turns, proactively deciding when to reply during video playback presents a promising yet challenging direction for real-time applications. In this work, we propose a novel text-to-text approach to proactive interaction, where the model autonomously determines whether to respond or remain silent at each turn based on dialogue history and visual context up to current frame of an streaming video. To overcome difficulties in previous methods such as manually tuning response decision thresholds and annotating precise reply times, we introduce a multi-turn RL based training method that encourages timely and accurate responses without requiring precise response time annotations. We train our model MMDuet2 on a dataset of 52k videos with two types of dialogues via SFT and RL.

Although IQA and restoration are closely connected conceptually, most existing work treats them in isolation. Recent advances in unified multimodal understanding-generation models demonstrate promising results and indicate that stronger understanding can improve generative performance. This motivates a single model that unifies IQA and restoration and explicitly studies how IQA can guide restoration, a setting that remains largely underexplored yet highly valuable. In this paper, we propose UARE, to our knowledge the first Unified vision-language model for image quality Assessment, Restoration, and Enhancement. Built on pretrained unified understanding and generation models, we introduce a two-stage training framework. First, a progressive, easy-to-hard schedule expands from single-type distortions to higher-order mixed degradations, enabling UARE to handle multiple degradations. Second, we perform unified fine-tuning of quality understanding and restoration with interleaved text-image data, aligning IQA signals with restoration objectives.

However, existing implementations operate at the module level, requiring architecture-specific propagation rules and modifications. These limit the generality of target model and sustainability of implementations as architectures evolve. We introduce DynamicLRP, a model-agnostic LRP framework operating at the tensor operation level. By decomposing attribution to individual operations within computation graphs and introducing a novel mechanism for deferred activation resolution, named the Promise System, our approach achieves true architecture agnosticity while maintaining LRP's theoretical guarantees. This design operates independently of backpropagation machinery, enabling operation on arbitrary computation graphs without model modification and side-by-side execution with gradient backpropagation. Being based on computation graphs, this method is theoretically extensible to other deep learning libraries that support auto-differentiation. We demonstrate faithfulness matching or exceeding specialized implementations (1.77 vs 1.69 ABPC on VGG, equivalent performance on ViT, 93.70\\% and 95.06\\% top-1 attribution accuracy for explaining RoBERTa-large and Flan-T5-large answers on SQuADv2, respectively) while maintaining practical efficiency on models with hundreds of millions of parameters. We achieved 99.92\\% node coverage across 31,465 computation graph nodes from 15 diverse architectures, including state-space models (Mamba), audio transformers (Whisper), and multimodal systems (DePlot) without any model-specific code with rules for 47 fundamental operations implemented.

While existing keyframe sampling methods can improve temporal modeling efficiency, additional computational cost is introduced before feature encoding, and the binary frame selection paradigm is found suboptimal. Therefore, in this work, we propose Dynamic Token compression via LLM-guided Keyframe prior (DyToK), a training-free paradigm that enables dynamic token compression by harnessing VLLMs' inherent attention mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that VLLM attention layers naturally encoding query-conditioned keyframe priors, by which DyToK dynamically adjusts per-frame token retention ratios, prioritizing semantically rich frames while suppressing redundancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyToK achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs. DyToK shows plug-and-play compatibility with existing compression methods, such as VisionZip and FastV, attaining 4.3x faster inference while preserving accuracy across multiple VLLMs, such as LLaVA-OneVision and Qwen2.5-VL.

Code: https://github.com/Danielohayon/Block-Sparse-Flash-Attention", "summary": "Modern large language models increasingly require long contexts for reasoning and multi-document tasks, but attention's quadratic complexity creates a severe computational bottleneck. We present Block-Sparse FlashAttention (BSFA), a drop-in replacement that accelerates long-context inference while preserving model quality. Unlike methods that predict importance before computing scores, BSFA computes exact query-key similarities to select the top-k most important value blocks for each query. By comparing per-block maximum scores against calibrated thresholds, we skip approximately 50% of the computation and memory transfers for pruned blocks. Our training-free approach requires only a one-time threshold calibration on a small dataset to learn the per-layer and per-head attention score distributions. We provide a CUDA kernel implementation that can be used as a drop-in replacement for FlashAttention. On Llama-3.1-8B, BSFA achieves up to 1.10x speedup on real-world reasoning benchmarks and up to 1.24x for needle-in-a-haystack retrieval tasks while maintaining above 99% baseline accuracy, with certain configurations even improving accuracy by focusing on the most relevant content, substantially outperforming existing sparse attention methods.

With improved zero-shot performance and more effective human-machine interaction, they provide a strong foundation for advancing surgical education and assistance. However, existing research and datasets primarily focus on understanding surgical procedures and workflows, while paying limited attention to the critical role of anatomical comprehension. In clinical practice, surgeons rely heavily on precise anatomical understanding to interpret, review, and learn from surgical videos. To fill this gap, we introduce the Neurosurgical Anatomy Benchmark (NeuroABench), the first multimodal benchmark explicitly created to evaluate anatomical understanding in the neurosurgical domain. NeuroABench consists of 9 hours of annotated neurosurgical videos covering 89 distinct procedures and is developed using a novel multimodal annotation pipeline with multiple review cycles. The benchmark evaluates the identification of 68 clinical anatomical structures, providing a rigorous and standardized framework for assessing model performance. Experiments on over 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant limitations, with the best-performing model achieving only 40.87% accuracy in anatomical identification tasks. To further evaluate the benchmark, we extract a subset of the dataset and conduct an informative test with four neurosurgical trainees. The results show that the best-performing student achieves 56% accuracy, with the lowest scores of 28% and an average score of 46.5%. While the best MLLM performs comparably to the lowest-scoring student, it still lags significantly behind the group's average performance. This comparison underscores both the progress of MLLMs in anatomical understanding and the substantial gap that remains in achieving human-level performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u89e3\u5256\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6NeuroABench\uff0c\u5305\u542b9\u5c0f\u65f6\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u300189\u79cd\u624b\u672f\u53ca68\u4e2a\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18MLLM\u4ec5\u8fbe40.87%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u751f\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\uff0846.5%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u624b\u672f\u6d41\u7a0b\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u5411\u89e3\u5256\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaNeuroABench\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e9\u5c0f\u65f6\u591a\u6e90\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u8986\u76d689\u79cd\u624b\u672f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6807\u6ce868\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5e76\u572810\u4f59\u4e2aSOTA MLLM\u53ca4\u540d\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u57f9\u8bad\u533b\u751f\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73MLLM\u5728\u89e3\u5256\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a40.87%\uff1b\u533b\u5b66\u751f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad856%\u3001\u6700\u4f4e28%\u3001\u5e73\u574746.5%\uff0cMLLM\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f4e\u5206\u533b\u5b66\u751f\u4f46\u660e\u663e\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuroABench\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dMLLM\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89e3\u5256\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Recent works on co-designing camera systems with perception tasks have shown improved task performance. However, most prior approaches focus on optimising fixed camera parameters set at manufacturing, while many parameters, such as exposure settings, require adaptive control at runtime. This paper introduces a method that jointly optimises camera hardware and adaptive camera control algorithms with downstream vision tasks. We present a unified optimisation framework that integrates gradient-based and derivative-free methods, enabling support for both continuous and discrete parameters, non-differentiable image formation processes, and neural network-based adaptive control algorithms. To address non-differentiable effects such as motion blur, we propose DF-Grad, a hybrid optimisation strategy that trains adaptive control networks using signals from a derivative-free optimiser alongside unsupervised task-driven learning. Experiments show that our method outperforms baselines that optimise static and dynamic parameters separately, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light and fast motion. These results demonstrate that jointly optimising hardware parameters and adaptive control algorithms improves perception performance and provides a unified approach to task-driven camera system design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u786c\u4ef6\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u5236\u9020\u65f6\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5982\u66dd\u5149\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u4e0e\u65e0\u5bfc\u6570\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u7eed/\u79bb\u6563\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u6210\u50cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1DF-Grad\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u5bfc\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a7\u5236\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We employ a self-supervised, joint-embedding pre-training stage to create an ECG representation that is enriched with contextual clinical information, while only requiring the ECG signal at inference time. Furthermore, as an indirect way to explain the model's output we train it to also predict associated laboratory abnormalities directly from the ECG embedding. Evaluated on the MIMIC-IV-ECG dataset, our model outperforms a standard signal-only baseline in multi-label diagnosis classification and successfully bridges a substantial portion of the performance gap to a fully multimodal model that requires all data at inference. Our work demonstrates a practical and effective method for creating more accurate and trustworthy ECG classification models.

Traditional biological network analysis methods, including deep learning approaches, while powerful, face inherent challenges such as limited scalability, oversmoothing long-range dependencies, difficulty in multimodal integration, expressivity bounds, and poor interpretability. We present Graph2Image, a framework that transforms large biological networks into sets of two-dimensional images by spatially arranging representative network nodes on a 2D grid. This transformation decouples the nodes as images, enabling the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with global receptive fields and multi-scale pyramids, thus overcoming limitations of existing biological network analysis methods in scalability, memory efficiency, and long-range context capture. Graph2Image also facilitates seamless integration with other imaging and omics modalities and enhances interpretability through direct visualization of node-associated images. When applied to several large-scale biological network datasets, Graph2Image improved classification accuracy by up to 67.2% over existing methods and provided interpretable visualizations that revealed biologically coherent patterns. It also allows analysis of very large biological networks (nodes > 1 billion) on a personal computer.

However, existing 3DGS watermarking methods remain highly vulnerable to diffusion-based editing, which can easily erase embedded provenance. This challenge highlights the urgent need for 3DGS watermarking techniques that are intrinsically resilient to diffusion-based editing. In this paper, we introduce RDSplat, a Robust watermarking paradigm against Diffusion editing for 3D Gaussian Splatting. RDSplat embeds watermarks into 3DGS components that diffusion-based editing inherently preserve, achieved through (i) proactively targeting low-frequency Gaussians and (ii) adversarial training with a diffusion proxy. Specifically, we introduce a multi-domain framework that operates natively in 3DGS space and embeds watermarks into diffusion-editing-preserved low-frequency Gaussians via coordinated covariance regularization and 2D filtering. In addition, we exploit the low-pass filtering behavior of diffusion-based editing by using Gaussian blur as an efficient training surrogate, enabling adversarial fine-tuning that further enhances watermark robustness against diffusion-based editing. Empirically, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RDSplat not only maintains superior robustness under diffusion-based editing, but also preserves watermark invisibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRDSplat\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf93D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6570\u5b57\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u96be\u4ee5\u7834\u574f\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u91cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0e2D\u6ee4\u6ce2\u53ca\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u7cca\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6c34\u5370\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093DGS\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\u6781\u6613\u88ab\u64e6\u9664\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5177\u5907\u5185\u5728\u6297\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRDSplat\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u4e3b\u52a8\u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u5929\u7136\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u91cf\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u57df\u539f\u751f3DGS\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0e2D\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u7cca\u6a21\u62df\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u4f4e\u901a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u6563\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRDSplat\u5728\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u6c34\u5370\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "RDSplat\u4e3a3DGS\u5185\u5bb9\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6c34\u5370\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, many recent innovations in masking-based pretraining are introduced as heuristics and lack principled evaluation, obscuring which design choices are genuinely effective. This work cast the entire pretrain-finetune workflow into a unified probabilistic framework, enabling a transparent comparison and deeper understanding of masking strategies. Building on this formalism, we conduct a controlled study of three core design dimensions: masking distribution, prediction target, and encoder architecture, under rigorously controlled settings. We further employ information-theoretic measures to assess the informativeness of pretraining signals and connect them to empirically benchmarked downstream performance. Our findings reveal a surprising insight: sophisticated masking distributions offer no consistent benefit over uniform sampling for common node-level prediction tasks. Instead, the choice of prediction target and its synergy with the encoder architecture are far more critical. Specifically, shifting to semantically richer targets yields substantial downstream improvements, particularly when paired with expressive Graph Transformer encoders. These insights offer practical guidance for developing more effective SSL methods for molecular graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a9\u7801\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u4e0d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u56feTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u63a9\u7801\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5173\u8054\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5747\u5300\u63a9\u7801\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0d\u900a\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u63a9\u7801\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u6216\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4e0eGraph Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6bd4\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u672c\u8eab\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present a real-time post-processing algorithm fusing the strengths of BlazePose 3D and 2D estimations using a weighted optimization, penalizing deviations from expected bone length and biomechanical models. Bone length estimations are refined to the individual anatomy using a Kalman filter with adapting measurement trust. Evaluation using the Physio2.2M dataset shows a 10.2 percent reduction in 3D MPJPE and a 16.6 percent decrease in errors of angles between body segments compared to BlazePose 3D estimation.

RetroCast is available on GitHub, see https://github.com/ischemist/project-procrustes. SynthArena is publicly available, see https://syntharena.ischemist.com/", "summary": "Progress in computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) is obscured by the lack of standardized evaluation infrastructure and the reliance on metrics that prioritize topological completion over chemical validity. We introduce RetroCast, a unified evaluation suite that standardizes heterogeneous model outputs into a common schema to enable statistically rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison. The framework includes a reproducible benchmarking pipeline with stratified sampling and bootstrapped confidence intervals, accompanied by SynthArena, an interactive platform for qualitative route inspection. We utilize this infrastructure to evaluate leading search-based and sequence-based algorithms on a new suite of standardized benchmarks. Our analysis reveals a divergence between \"solvability\" (stock-termination rate) and route quality; high solvability scores often mask chemical invalidity or fail to correlate with the reproduction of experimental ground truths. Furthermore, we identify a \"complexity cliff\" in which search-based methods, despite high solvability rates, exhibit a sharp performance decay in reconstructing long-range synthetic plans compared to sequence-based approaches. We release the full framework, benchmark definitions, and a standardized database of model predictions to support transparent and reproducible development in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RetroCast\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5408\u6210\u8def\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\uff08CASP\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u62d3\u6251\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u5e73\u53f0SynthArena\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6d41\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u2018\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u2019\u4e0e\u2018\u8def\u7ebf\u8d28\u91cf\u2019\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8131\u8282\u4ee5\u53ca\u641c\u7d22\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u2018\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u60ac\u5d16\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CASP\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u7528\u6307\u6807\u504f\u91cd\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u5339\u914d\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u5316\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\u6216\u8bef\u5224\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaRetroCast\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u7edf\u4e00\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u8def\u7ebfSchema\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5f00\u53d1SynthArena\u5e73\u53f0\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u5de5\u5b9a\u6027\u5ba1\u67e5\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u9ad8\u2018\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u2019\uff08stock-termination rate\uff09\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u5316\u5b66\u65e0\u6548\u6027\u6216\u504f\u79bb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u771f\u5b9e\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u641c\u7d22\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u60ac\u5d16\u2019\u2014\u2014\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u5e8f\u5217\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "RetroCast\u63a8\u52a8CASP\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u2018\u80fd\u5426\u627e\u5230\u8def\u5f84\u2019\u8f6c\u5411\u2018\u662f\u5426\u627e\u5230\u5408\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u8def\u5f84\u2019\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Although such approaches improve safety awareness and interpretability, this single-pass think-then-answer paradigm remains vulnerable to contextual or visual jailbreak attacks. This reveals a critical flaw: single-pass reasoning may overlook explicit harmful content in its own output. Our key insight is to exploit this wasted signal through reflection, which can effectively leverage the malicious content revealed in the first-pass reasoning to enable genuine self-correction and prevent unsafe generations. Motivated by this, we propose Think-Reflect-Revise (TRR), a three-stage training framework designed to enhance the safety alignment of LVLMs through policy-guided self-reflection. We first build a Reflective Safety Reasoning (ReSafe) dataset with 5,000 examples that follow a think-reflect-revise process. We then fine-tune the target model using the ReSafe dataset to initialize reflective behavior, and finally reinforce policy-guided reflection through reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that TRR substantially improves the safety performance of LVLMs across both safety-awareness benchmarks and jailbreak attack evaluations, increasing the overall safe response rate from 42.8% to 87.7% on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, while preserving stable performance on general benchmarks such as MMMU and MMStar.

Both steps are lightweight and complementary, leading to the construction of a generalized geometry encoding volume with strong generalization capability.

Among these, video creation, aimed at generating videos under various conditions, has gained substantial attention. However, existing video creation models either focus solely on a few specific conditions or suffer from excessively long generation times due to complex model inference, making them impractical for real-world applications. To mitigate these issues, we propose an efficient unified video creation model, named VDOT. Concretely, we model the training process with the distribution matching distillation (DMD) paradigm. Instead of using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization, we additionally employ a novel computational optimal transport (OT) technique to optimize the discrepancy between the real and fake score distributions. The OT distance inherently imposes geometric constraints, mitigating potential zero-forcing or gradient collapse issues that may arise during KL-based distillation within the few-step generation scenario, and thus, enhances the efficiency and stability of the distillation process. Further, we integrate a discriminator to enable the model to perceive real video data, thereby enhancing the quality of generated videos. To support training unified video creation models, we propose a fully automated pipeline for video data annotation and filtering that accommodates multiple video creation tasks. Meanwhile, we curate a unified testing benchmark, UVCBench, to standardize evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our 4-step VDOT outperforms or matches other baselines with 100 denoising steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578bVDOT\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u84b8\u998f\uff08DMD\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u6280\u672f\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfKL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u574d\u7f29\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5224\u522b\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u6ce8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6UVCBench\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u97004\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u7684VDOT\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a100\u6b65\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5c11\u6570\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u56e0\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8017\u65f6\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVDOT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u84b8\u998f\uff08DMD\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u8ddd\u79bb\u66ff\u4ee3KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5224\u522b\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u6ce8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6UVCBench\u3002", "result": "4\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u7684VDOT\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u9700100\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "VDOT\u901a\u8fc7OT\u9a71\u52a8\u7684DMD\u84b8\u998f\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u5668\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prevailing alignment methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), rely on stochastic weight updates that often incur an \"alignment tax\" -- degrading general reasoning capabilities.\n  Methods: We propose the Soul Engine, a framework based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis, which posits that personality traits exist as orthogonal linear subspaces. We introduce SoulBench, a dataset constructed via dynamic contextual sampling. Using a dual-head architecture on a frozen Qwen-2.5 base, we extract disentangled personality vectors without modifying the backbone weights.\n  Results: Our experiments demonstrate three breakthroughs. First, High-Precision Profiling: The model achieves a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.011 against psychological ground truth. Second, Geometric Orthogonality: T-SNE visualization confirms that personality manifolds are distinct and continuous, allowing for \"Zero-Shot Personality Injection\" that maintains original model intelligence. Third, Deterministic Steering: We achieve robust control over behavior via vector arithmetic, validated through extensive ablation studies.\n  Conclusion: This work challenges the necessity of fine-tuning for personalization. By transitioning from probabilistic prompting to deterministic latent intervention, we provide a mathematically rigorous foundation for safe, controllable AI personalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSoul Engine\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u6b63\u4ea4\u4eba\u683c\u5411\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027-\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u2018\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0e\u2019\uff08\u5373\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u5047\u8bbe\u7684Soul Engine\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91c7\u6837\u7684SoulBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5934\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3Qwen-2.5\u57fa\u5ea7\u4e0a\u63d0\u53d6\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4eba\u683c\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3b\u5e72\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e09\u9879\u7a81\u7834\uff1a1\uff09\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4eba\u683c\u5efa\u6a21\uff08MSE=0.011\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u4eba\u683c\u6d41\u5f62\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e14\u8fde\u7eed\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4eba\u683c\u6ce8\u5165\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u91cf\u8fd0\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u5e76\u7ecf\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5fc5\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u6982\u7387\u63d0\u793a\u8f6c\u5411\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6f5c\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684AI\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Zhu"], "title": "Generating Storytelling Images with Rich Chains-of-Reasoning", "comment": null, "summary": "An image can convey a compelling story by presenting rich, logically connected visual clues. These connections form Chains-of-Reasoning (CoRs) within the image, enabling viewers to infer events, causal relationships, and other information, thereby understanding the underlying story. In this paper, we focus on these semantically rich images and define them as Storytelling Images. Such images have diverse applications beyond illustration creation and cognitive screening, leveraging their ability to convey multi-layered information visually and inspire active interpretation. However, due to their complex semantic nature, Storytelling Images are inherently challenging to create, and thus remain relatively scarce. To address this challenge, we introduce the Storytelling Image Generation task, which explores how generative AI models can be leveraged to create such images. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline, StorytellingPainter, which combines the creative reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the visual synthesis capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate Storytelling Images. Alongside this pipeline, we develop a dedicated evaluation framework comprising three main evaluators: a Semantic Complexity Evaluator, a KNN-based Diversity Evaluator and a Story-Image Alignment Evaluator. Given the critical role of story generation in the Storytelling Image Generation task and the performance disparity between open-source and proprietary LLMs, we further explore tailored training strategies to reduce this gap, resulting in a series of lightweight yet effective models named Mini-Storytellers.

To overcome these limitations, we present Dual Refinement Cycle Learning (DRCL), a fully unsupervised framework designed for practical scenarios where no labels or category definitions are available.\n  DRCL integrates structural and semantic information through a warm-start initialization and a bidirectional refinement cycle between a GCN-based Community Detection Module (GCN-CDM) and a Text Semantic Modeling Module (TSMM). The two modules iteratively exchange pseudo-labels, allowing semantic cues to enhance structural clustering and structural patterns to guide text representation learning without manual supervision.\n  Across several text-attributed graph datasets, DRCL consistently improves the structural and semantic quality of discovered communities.

However, fine-tuning VLMs in few-shot scenarios poses significant challenges in balancing task-specific adaptation and generalization in the obtained model. Meanwhile, current researches have predominantly focused on prompt-based adaptation methods, leaving adapter-based approaches underexplored and revealing notable performance gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Reconstruction-based Multimodal Adapter (RMAdapter), which leverages a dual-branch architecture. Unlike conventional single-branch adapters, RMAdapter consists of: (1) an adaptation branch that injects task-specific knowledge through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and (2) a reconstruction branch that preserves general knowledge by reconstructing latent space features back into the original feature space. This design facilitates a dynamic balance between general and task-specific knowledge. Importantly, although RMAdapter introduces an additional reconstruction branch, it is carefully optimized to remain lightweight. By computing reconstruction loss locally at each layer and sharing projection modules, the overall computational overhead is kept minimal. A consistency constraint is also incorporated to better regulate the trade-off between discriminability and generalization. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of RMAdapter on three representative tasks: generalization to new categories, generalization to new target datasets, and domain generalization.

Theoretically, FOAM achieves convergence rates equivalent to vanilla Adam under standard non-convex optimization settings. Empirically, FOAM reduces total training memory by approximately 50\\%, eliminates up to 90\\% of optimizer state memory overhead, and accelerates convergence.

However, existing unlearning methods often require full-model fine-tuning or access to the original training data, which limits their scalability and practicality. In this work, we introduce Recover-to-Forget (R2F), a novel framework for efficient unlearning in LLMs based on reconstructing full-model gradient directions from low-rank LoRA adapter updates. Rather than performing backpropagation through the full model, we compute gradients with respect to LoRA parameters using multiple paraphrased prompts and train a gradient decoder to approximate the corresponding full-model gradients. To ensure applicability to larger or black-box models, the decoder is trained on a proxy model and transferred to target models. We provide a theoretical analysis of cross-model generalization and demonstrate that our method achieves effective unlearning while preserving general model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that R2F offers a scalable and lightweight alternative for unlearning in pretrained LLMs without requiring full retraining or access to internal parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRecover-to-Forget\uff08R2F\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u2018\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u2019\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u91cd\u6784\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u9700\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\u6743\u53ca\u884c\u4e3a\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR2F\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u6539\u5199\u63d0\u793a\u8ba1\u7b97LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u68af\u5ea6\uff1b\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u542b\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eR2F\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u901a\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8bbf\u95ee\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "R2F\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Recent advances including AgroNT and PDLLMs have made notable progress although, they suffer from excessive parameter size and limited ability to model the bidirectional nature of DNA strands respectively. To address these limitations, we propose PlantBiMoE, a lightweight and expressive plant genome language model that integrates bidirectional Mamba and a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SparseMoE) framework. The bidirectional Mamba enables the model to effectively capture structural dependencies across both the forward and reverse DNA strands, while SparseMoE significantly reduces the number of active parameters, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing modeling capacity. We evaluated and tested our model on the Modified Plants Genome Benchmark (MPGB), an enhanced genomic benchmark, which consolidates 31 datasets across 11 representative tasks, with input sequence lengths ranging from 50 to 6,000 bp.

However, current approaches sharing dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features are constrained by quadratically-scaling communication costs and the lack of flexibility and interpretability for precise alignment across asynchronous or disparate viewpoints. While emerging sparse query-based methods offer an alternative, they often suffer from inadequate geometric representations, suboptimal fusion strategies, and training instability. In this paper, we propose SparseCoop, a fully sparse cooperative perception framework for 3D detection and tracking that completely discards intermediate BEV representations. Our framework features a trio of innovations: a kinematic-grounded instance query that uses an explicit state vector with 3D geometry and velocity for precise spatio-temporal alignment; a coarse-to-fine aggregation module for robust fusion; and a cooperative instance denoising task to accelerate and stabilize training. Experiments on V2X-Seq and Griffin datasets show SparseCoop achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it delivers this with superior computational efficiency, low transmission cost, and strong robustness to communication latency.

However, state-of-the-art methods of drawing these tickets, like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), are computationally prohibitive, while more efficient saliency-based Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) techniques suffer from a significant accuracy-sparsity trade-off and fail basic sanity checks. In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes. CTS's subnetworks outperform saliency-based methods across all sparsities, but its advantage over LTR is most pronounced in the highly sparse regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faConcrete Ticket Search (CTS)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u53d1\u73b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Concrete\u677e\u5f1b\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCTS\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7KL\u6563\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Pruning-at-Initialization\uff08PaI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u9636\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6743\u91cd\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u672c\u5408\u7406\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\uff1b\u800cLottery Ticket Rewinding\uff08LTR\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3PaI\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConcrete Ticket Search\uff08CTS\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u641c\u7d22\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528Concrete\u677e\u5f1b\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165GRADBALANCE\u673a\u5236\u63a7\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\uff1b4\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u526a\u679d\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u7a20\u5bc6\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u95f4\u7684\u9006KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff08CTS-KL\uff09\u3002", "result": "CTS\u5728CIFAR10\u4e0aResNet-20\u8fbe\u523099.3%\u7a00\u758f\u7387\u300174.0%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4ec5\u8017\u65f67.9\u5206\u949f\uff08LTR\u970095.2\u5206\u949f\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec568.3%\uff09\uff1b\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7a33\u5065\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u8d85\u8d8aLTR\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6781\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u7c7b\u663e\u8457\u6027\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CTS\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6743\u91cd\u534f\u540c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u65b0\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86PaI\u4e0eLTR\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5f69\u7968\u7968\u641c\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces hallucination rates by 9.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, while improving object existence accuracy by 4.7 points on adversarial splits. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms that uncertainty-guided re-attention successfully grounds corrections in visual evidence where standard decoding fails.

In recent years, weakly-supervised VAD (WVAD) have attracted considerable attention due to their easy annotation process and promising research results. While existing WVAD methods tackle mainly on static datasets, the possibility that the domain of data can vary has been neglected. To adapt such domain-shift, the continual learning (CL) perspective is required because otherwise additional training only with new coming data could easily cause performance degradation for previous data, i.e., forgetting. Therefore, we propose a brand-new approach, called Continual Anomaly Detection with Ensembles (CADE) that is the first work combining CL and WVAD viewpoints. Specifically, CADE uses the Dual-Generator(DG) to address data imbalance and label uncertainty in WVAD. We also found that forgetting exacerbates the \"incompleteness'' where the model becomes biased towards certain anomaly modes, leading to missed detections of various anomalies. To address this, we propose to ensemble Multi-Discriminator (MD) that capture missed anomalies in past scenes due to forgetting, using multiple models. Extensive experiments show that CADE significantly outperforms existing VAD methods on the common multi-scene VAD datasets, such as ShanghaiTech and Charlotte Anomaly datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u4e0e\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08WVAD\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6 CADE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08DG\uff09\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff08MD\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u56e0\u9057\u5fd8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5728 ShanghaiTech \u548c Charlotte \u7b49\u591a\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08WVAD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u57df\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u65e7\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u5373\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CADE \u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08DG\uff09\u5e94\u5bf9 WVAD \u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff08MD\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u83b7\u56e0\u9057\u5fd8\u800c\u6f0f\u68c0\u7684\u8fc7\u5f80\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5728 ShanghaiTech \u548c Charlotte Anomaly \u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u591a\u573a\u666f VAD \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCADE \u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709 VAD \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CADE \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684 VAD \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Our method integrates Langevin dynamics for manifold-consistent exploration with proximal optimization for precise mode seeking, achieving a superior balance between reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality across multiple inverse tasks on FFHQ and DIV2K, outperforming state of the art inverse solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFlowLPS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Langevin\u8fd1\u7aef\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u540e\u9a8c\u4f17\u6570\u6216\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u53d1\u751f\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlowLPS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Langevin\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08\u4fdd\u969c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u4e0e\u8fd1\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfb\u627e\u4f17\u6570\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728FFHQ\u548cDIV2K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u591a\u4e2a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowLPS\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

For synthesis, we select class-relevant initial images with CLIP and refine textual prompts with a vision-language model to improve fidelity and scene consistency before invoking a video diffusion model. For training, we mitigate excessive spatiotemporal magnitude in synthesized anomalies by an domain-aligned regularized module that combines domain alignment and memory usage-aware updates.

GRAPE brings together two families of mechanisms: (i) multiplicative rotations (Multiplicative GRAPE) in $\\mathrm{SO}(d)$ and (ii) additive logit biases (Additive GRAPE) arising from unipotent actions in the general linear group $\\mathrm{GL}$. In Multiplicative GRAPE, a position $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (or $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$) acts as $\\mathbf{G}(n)=\\exp(n\\,\u03c9\\,\\mathbf{L})$ with a rank-2 skew generator $\\mathbf{L} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$, yielding a relative, compositional, norm-preserving map with a closed-form matrix exponential. RoPE is recovered exactly when the $d/2$ planes are the canonical coordinate pairs with log-uniform spectrum. Learned commuting subspaces and compact non-commuting mixtures strictly extend this geometry to capture cross-subspace feature coupling at $O(d)$ and $O(r d)$ cost per head, respectively. In Additive GRAPE, additive logits arise as rank-1 (or low-rank) unipotent actions, recovering ALiBi and the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as exact special cases while preserving an exact relative law and streaming cacheability. Altogether, GRAPE supplies a principled design space for positional geometry in long-context models, subsuming RoPE and ALiBi as special cases.

We introduce a weakly supervised method trained solely on vertebra-level healthy/malignant labels, without any lesion masks. The method combines a Diffusion Autoencoder (DAE) that produces a classifier-guided healthy edit of each vertebra with pixel-wise difference maps that propose candidate lesion regions. To determine which regions truly reflect malignancy, we introduce Hide-and-Seek Attribution: each candidate is revealed in turn while all others are hidden, the edited image is projected back to the data manifold by the DAE, and a latent-space classifier quantifies the isolated malignant contribution of that component.

The basic principle is to iteratively refine the model with real samples and synthetic ones generated from itself. However, the existing methods primarily focus on the relative gaps between the rewards for two types of data, neglecting their absolute values. Through theoretical analysis, we identify that the gap-based methods suffer from unstable evolution, due to the potentially degenerated objectives. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel self-play fine-tuning method, namely Self-PlAy via Noise Contrastive Estimation (SPACE), which leverages noise contrastive estimation to capture the real-world data distribution. Specifically, SPACE treats synthetic samples as auxiliary components, and discriminates them from the real ones in a binary classification manner. As a result, SPACE independently optimizes the absolute reward values for each type of data, ensuring a consistently meaningful objective and thereby avoiding the instability issue. Theoretically, we show that the optimal solution of the objective in SPACE aligns with the underlying distribution of real-world data, and SPACE guarantees a provably stable convergence to the optimal distribution. Empirically, we show that SPACE significantly improves the performance of LLMs over various tasks, and outperforms supervised fine-tuning that employs much more real-world samples. Compared to gap-based self-play fine-tuning methods, SPACE exhibits remarkable superiority and stable evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08NCE\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5SPACE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u5f0f\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709gap-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u9000\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3001\u6f14\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSPACE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u6784\u5efa\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eSPACE\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSPACE\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u540e\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u591a\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\uff09\u548c\u73b0\u6709gap-based\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SPACE\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u7edd\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u800c\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

While diffusion models demonstrate exceptional performance in generation tasks, their application to TSF remains largely confined to modeling single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the abundant cross-modal signals inherent in complex heterogeneous data. To address this gap, we propose UniDiff, a unified diffusion framework for multimodal time series forecasting. To process the numerical sequence, our framework first tokenizes the time series into patches, preserving local temporal dynamics by mapping each patch to an embedding space via a lightweight MLP. At its core lies a unified and parallel fusion module, where a single cross-attention mechanism adaptively weighs and integrates structural information from timestamps and semantic context from texts in one step, enabling a flexible and efficient interplay between modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism designed for multi-source conditioning, allowing for decoupled control over the guidance strength of textual and temporal information during inference, which significantly enhances model robustness.

Segmenting a road network is widely recognized as the first and most critical step in developing an arrival time prediction system, particularly for auto-regressive-based approaches. Traditional methods typically employ a uniform segmentation strategy, which fails to account for varying physical constraints along roads, such as road conditions, intersections, and points of interest, thereby limiting prediction efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to efficiently and adaptively learn non-uniform road segments for arrival time prediction. Our method decouples the prediction process into two stages: 1) Non-uniform road segments are extracted based on their impact scores using the proposed RL framework; and 2) A linear prediction model is applied to the selected segments to make predictions. This method ensures optimal segment selection while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a significant improvement over traditional uniform approaches. Furthermore, our experimental results suggest that the linear approach can even achieve better performance than more complex methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which not only enhances efficiency but also improves learning performance on large-scale benchmarks.

To endow models with this ``recall\" ability, we propose the spatial retrieval paradigm, introducing offline retrieved geographic images as an additional input. These images are easy to obtain from offline caches (e.g, Google Maps or stored autonomous driving datasets) without requiring additional sensors, making it a plug-and-play extension for existing AD tasks.\n  For experiments, we first extend the nuScenes dataset with geographic images retrieved via Google Maps APIs and align the new data with ego-vehicle trajectories. We establish baselines across five core autonomous driving tasks: object detection, online mapping, occupancy prediction, end-to-end planning, and generative world modeling.

Existing methods, focusing on aggregation or regularization, fail to address this root cause of local training bias. To this end, we propose Geometry-Guided Text Prompt Calibration (GGTPC), a novel framework that directly corrects this bias by providing clients with a global geometric prior. This prior, representing the shape of the global data distribution derived from the covariance matrix, is reconstructed on the server in a privacy-preserving manner. Clients then use a novel Geometry-Prior Calibration Layer (GPCL) to align their local feature distributions with this global prior during training. Extensive experiments show GGTPC's effectiveness. On the label-skewed CIFAR-100 dataset ($\u03b2$=0.1), it outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.15\\%. Under extreme skew ($\u03b2$=0.01), it improves upon the baseline by 9.17\\%. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play module on the domain-skewed Office-Home dataset, it boosts FedAvg's performance by 4.60\\%.

Despite its success, this paradigm can generate erroneous pseudo-labels, which are further amplified during training due to utilization of one-hot encoding. To address this issue, we propose ECOCSeg, a novel perspective for segmentation models that utilizes error-correcting output codes (ECOC) to create a fine-grained encoding for each class. ECOCSeg offers several advantages. First, an ECOC-based classifier is introduced, enabling model to disentangle classes into attributes and handle partial inaccurate bits, improving stability and generalization in pseudo-label learning. Second, a bit-level label denoising mechanism is developed to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels, providing adequate and robust supervision for unlabeled images. ECOCSeg can be easily integrated with existing methods and consistently demonstrates significant improvements on multiple UDA and SSL benchmarks across different segmentation architectures.

The essential problem for such a data type is to determine nodes that carry greater importance than all the others, a task that markedly enhances system monitoring and management. Traditional methods to identify important nodes in networks introduce centrality measures, such as node degree or more complex PageRank. However, they consider only the network structure, neglecting the rich node attributes. Recent methods adopt neural networks capable of handling node features, but they require supervision. This work addresses the identified gap--the absence of approaches that are both unsupervised and attribute-aware--by introducing a Pipeline for Important Node Exploration (PINE). At the core of the proposed framework is an attention-based graph model that incorporates node semantic features in the learning process of identifying the structural graph properties. The PINE's node importance scores leverage the obtained attention distribution.

Alkhatib", "Ali Jamali", "Swalpa Kumar Roy"], "title": "SceneMixer: Exploring Convolutional Mixing Networks for Remote Sensing Scene Classification", "comment": "Accepted and presented in ICSPIS", "summary": "Remote sensing scene classification plays a key role in Earth observation by enabling the automatic identification of land use and land cover (LULC) patterns from aerial and satellite imagery. Despite recent progress with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), the task remains challenging due to variations in spatial resolution, viewpoint, orientation, and background conditions, which often reduce the generalization ability of existing models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight architecture based on the convolutional mixer paradigm. The model alternates between spatial mixing through depthwise convolutions at multiple scales and channel mixing through pointwise operations, enabling efficient extraction of both local and contextual information while keeping the number of parameters and computations low. Extensive experiments were conducted on the AID and EuroSAT benchmarks. The proposed model achieved overall accuracy, average accuracy, and Kappa values of 74.7%, 74.57%, and 73.79 on the AID dataset, and 93.90%, 93.93%, and 93.22 on EuroSAT, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a good balance between accuracy and efficiency compared with widely used CNN- and transformer-based models.

However, the data-based pattern makes related algorithms learn and even exacerbate potential bias in samples, resulting in discriminatory decisions against certain unprivileged groups, depriving them of the rights to equal treatment, thus damaging the social well-being and hindering the development of related applications. Therefore, we propose a pre-processing method IFFair based on the influence function. Compared with other fairness optimization approaches, IFFair only uses the influence disparity of training samples on different groups as a guidance to dynamically adjust the sample weights during training without modifying the network structure, data features and decision boundaries. To evaluate the validity of IFFair, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets and metrics. The experimental results show that our approach mitigates bias of multiple accepted metrics in the classification setting, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity and error rate parity without conflicts.

Supplementary video and poster available upon request", "summary": "Reliable 3D segmentation is critical for understanding complex scenes with dense layouts and multi-scale objects, as commonly seen in industrial environments. In such scenarios, heavy occlusion weakens geometric boundaries between objects, and large differences in object scale will cause end-to-end models fail to capture both coarse and fine details accurately. Existing 3D point-based methods require costly annotations, while image-guided methods often suffer from semantic inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical image-guided 3D segmentation framework that progressively refines segmentation from instance-level to part-level. Instance segmentation involves rendering a top-view image and projecting SAM-generated masks prompted by YOLO-World back onto the 3D point cloud. Part-level segmentation is subsequently performed by rendering multi-view images of each instance obtained from the previous stage and applying the same 2D segmentation and back-projection process at each view, followed by Bayesian updating fusion to ensure semantic consistency across views. Experiments on real-world factory data demonstrate that our method effectively handles occlusion and structural complexity, achieving consistently high per-class mIoU scores. Additional evaluations on public dataset confirm the generalization ability of our framework, highlighting its robustness, annotation efficiency, and adaptability to diverse 3D environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u76843D\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5230\u90e8\u4ef6\u7ea7\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SAM\u4e0eYOLO-World\u751f\u62102D\u63a9\u7801\u5e76\u53cd\u6295\u5f71\u81f33D\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u524a\u5f31\u51e0\u4f55\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u70b9\u4e91\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u76843D\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u2014\u2014\u6e32\u67d3\u4fef\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u7528YOLO-World\u63d0\u793aSAM\u751f\u62102D\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u53cd\u6295\u5f71\u81f33D\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b2\uff09\u90e8\u4ef6\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u2014\u2014\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6e32\u67d3\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6267\u884c2D\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u53cd\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u878d\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u5382\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u906e\u6321\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5404\u7c7b\u522bmIoU\u7a33\u5b9a\u9886\u5148\uff1b\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ca\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u53163D\u73af\u5883\u7684\u826f\u597d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5206\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u878d\u54082D\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u3001\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u56fe\uff08SIT-Graph\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2dLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\uff08\u6574\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u6216\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u6216\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5de5\u5177\u95f4\u9759\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u56fe\uff08SIT-Graph\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u6761\u8fb9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd8\u9644\u5e26\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6458\u8981\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u5386\u53f2\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u7c7b\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u72b6\u6001\u7247\u6bb5\uff09\u548c\u7c7b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u5de5\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u9700\u6c42\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u68c0\u7d22\u72b6\u6001\u6458\u8981\u6216\u6267\u884c\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSIT-Graph\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SIT-Graph\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u610f\u56fe\u6e10\u8fdb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, existing methods still face two major challenges: their U-Net-based architectures constrain the visual quality of the generated panoramas, and they usually treat the two core tasks independently, which leads to modeling redundancy and inefficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint-face panorama (JoPano) generation approach that unifies the two core tasks within a DiT-based model. To transfer the rich generative capabilities of existing DiT backbones learned from natural images to the panorama domain, we propose a Joint-Face Adapter built on the cubemap representation of panoramas, which enables a pretrained DiT to jointly model and generate different views of a panorama. We further apply Poisson Blending to reduce seam inconsistencies that often appear at the boundaries between cube faces. Correspondingly, we introduce Seam-SSIM and Seam-Sobel metrics to quantitatively evaluate the seam consistency. Moreover, we propose a condition switching mechanism that unifies text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama tasks within a single model. Comprehensive experiments show that JoPano can generate high-quality panoramas for both text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on FID, CLIP-FID, IS, and CLIP-Score metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684\u8054\u5408\u9762\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5JoPano\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u5230\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u4e24\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Joint-Face Adapter\u3001Poisson Blending\u53ca\u6761\u4ef6\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u65e0\u7f1d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\u5230\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u88ab\u72ec\u7acb\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJoPano\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8ecubemap\u8868\u793a\u6784\u5efaJoint-Face Adapter\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fbDiT\u9aa8\u5e72\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Poisson Blending\u7f13\u89e3\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u9762\u95f4\u63a5\u7f1d\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\u7edf\u4e00\u4e24\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u63d0\u51faSeam-SSIM\u548cSeam-Sobel\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a5\u7f1d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728FID\u3001CLIP-FID\u3001IS\u3001CLIP-Score\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "JoPano\u901a\u8fc7DiT\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u63a5\u7f1d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u666f\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Despite the effectiveness of self-training techniques in UDA, they struggle to learn each class in a balanced manner due to inherent class imbalance and distribution shift in both data and label space between domains. To address this issue, we propose Balanced Learning for Domain Adaptation (BLDA), a novel approach to directly assess and alleviate class bias without requiring prior knowledge about the distribution shift. First, we identify over-predicted and under-predicted classes by analyzing the distribution of predicted logits. Subsequently, we introduce a post-hoc approach to align the logits distributions across different classes using shared anchor distributions. To further consider the network's need to generate unbiased pseudo-labels during self-training, we estimate logits distributions online and incorporate logits correction terms into the loss function. Moreover, we leverage the resulting cumulative density as domain-shared structural knowledge to connect the source and target domains. Extensive experiments on two standard UDA semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that BLDA consistently improves performance, especially for under-predicted classes, when integrated into various existing methods.

We propose a discrete Bayesian framework that maintains exact posterior distributions over the time horizon, enabling principled uncertainty quantification and seamless incorporation of expert priors. Our algorithm achieves prior-dependent competitive guarantees and gracefully interpolates between worst-case and fully-informed settings. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates superior empirical performance across diverse scenarios, achieving near-optimal results under accurate priors while maintaining robust worst-case guarantees.

Existing methods place all entities on one homogeneous manifold, Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, or their product/multi-curvature variants, to model linear, symmetric, or hierarchical patterns. Yet a predefined, homogeneous manifold cannot accommodate the sharply varying curvature that real-world graphs exhibit across local regions. Since this geometry is imposed a priori, any mismatch with the knowledge graph's local curvatures will distort distances between entities and hurt the expressiveness of the resulting KGE. To rectify this, we propose RicciKGE to have the KGE loss gradient coupled with local curvatures in an extended Ricci flow such that entity embeddings co-evolve dynamically with the underlying manifold geometry towards mutual adaptation. Theoretically, when the coupling coefficient is bounded and properly selected, we rigorously prove that i) all the edge-wise curvatures decay exponentially, meaning that the manifold is driven toward the Euclidean flatness; and ii) the KGE distances strictly converge to a global optimum, which indicates that geometric flattening and embedding optimization are promoting each other. Experimental improvements on link prediction and node classification benchmarks demonstrate RicciKGE's effectiveness in adapting to heterogeneous knowledge graph structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRicciKGE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u635f\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\u8026\u5408\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u7684Ricci\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u8d28\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u540c\u8d28\u6d41\u5f62\uff08\u5982\u6b27\u6c0f\u3001\u7403\u9762\u6216\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u914d\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u8c31\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u5931\u771f\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRicciKGE\uff0c\u5c06KGE\u635f\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\u8026\u5408\u5230\u6269\u5c55Ricci\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b9e\u4f53\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5408\u7406\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fb9\u66f2\u7387\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u81f3\u6b27\u6c0f\u5e73\u5766\uff0c\u4e14\u5d4c\u5165\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e25\u683c\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RicciKGE\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u8d28\u6d41\u5f62\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

Current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches operate primarily on visual texture, often treating tissues as independent regions and failing to encode biological context. To this end, we introduce Neural Tissue Relation Modeling (NTRM), a novel segmentation framework that augments CNNs with a tissue-level graph neural network to model spatial and functional relationships across tissue types. NTRM constructs a graph over predicted regions, propagates contextual information via message passing, and refines segmentation through spatial projection. Unlike prior methods, NTRM explicitly encodes inter-tissue dependencies, enabling structurally coherent predictions in boundary-dense zones. On the benchmark Histopathology Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Segmentation Dataset, NTRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a robust Dice similarity coefficient that is 4.9\\% to 31.25\\% higher than the best-performing models among the evaluated approaches. Our experiments indicate that relational modeling offers a principled path toward more context-aware and interpretable histological segmentation, compared to local receptive-field architectures that lack tissue-level structural awareness.

To address these challenges, we introduce Style Invariance as a Correctness Likelihood (SICL), a framework that leverages style-invariance for robust uncertainty estimation.

This makes it a plug-and-play, backpropagation-free calibration module compatible with any TTA method.

Our proposed method replaces the random masking augmentation used in most masked image modelling pretraining methods. The proposed selective masking method selectively masks image patches with the highest reconstruction loss by breaking the image reconstruction pretraining into iterative steps to leverage the trained model's knowledge. We show on two general datasets (Pascal VOC and Cityscapes) and two weed segmentation datasets (Nassar 2020 and Sugarbeets 2016) that our proposed selective masking method outperforms the traditional random masking method and supervised ImageNet pretraining on downstream segmentation accuracy by 2.9% for general datasets and 2.5% for weed segmentation datasets. Furthermore, we found that our selective masking method significantly improves accuracy for the lowest-performing classes. Lastly, we show that using the same pretraining and downstream dataset yields the best result for low-budget self-supervised pretraining.

Hence, we propose incorporating both of these powerful visual cues via the Boundary Feature Enhancement and Reflection Feature Enhancement modules in a mutually beneficial way.

We formalize this distinction as the gap between deep feature-space and shallow classifier-level forgetting. We reveal a critical asymmetry in Experience Replay: while minimal buffers successfully anchor feature geometry and prevent deep forgetting, mitigating shallow forgetting typically requires substantially larger buffer capacities. To explain this, we extend the Neural Collapse framework to the sequential setting. We characterize deep forgetting as a geometric drift toward out-of-distribution subspaces and prove that any non-zero replay fraction asymptotically guarantees the retention of linear separability. Conversely, we identify that the \"strong collapse\" induced by small buffers leads to rank-deficient covariances and inflated class means, effectively blinding the classifier to true population boundaries. By unifying CL with out-of-distribution detection, our work challenges the prevailing reliance on large buffers, suggesting that explicitly correcting these statistical artifacts could unlock robust performance with minimal replay.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u6d45\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u867d\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff08\u9632\u6b62\u6df1\u5c42\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\uff0c\u5374\u56e0\u5f15\u53d1'\u5f3a\u574d\u7f29'\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5931\u6548\uff08\u6d45\u5c42\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u574d\u7f29\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5e8f\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u6b63\u7edf\u8ba1\u5931\u771f\u800c\u975e\u6269\u5927\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u8fc7\u53bb\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u5398\u6e05\u6df1\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u6d45\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u574d\u7f29\uff08Neural Collapse\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u6df1\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u4e3a\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u610f\u975e\u96f6\u56de\u653e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5747\u53ef\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u5c0f\u7f13\u51b2\u5f15\u53d1\u7684'\u5f3a\u574d\u7f29'\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u79e9\u4e8f\u548c\u7c7b\u5747\u503c\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u6781\u5c0f\u7f13\u51b2\u5373\u53ef\u951a\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u6df1\u5c42\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u4f46\u7f13\u89e3\u6d45\u5c42\u9057\u5fd8\u9700\u5927\u5f97\u591a\u7684\u7f13\u51b2\u5bb9\u91cf\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u975e\u96f6\u56de\u653e\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5c0f\u7f13\u51b2\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5931\u771f\u662f\u6d45\u5c42\u9057\u5fd8\u4e3b\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u5e94\u76f2\u76ee\u6269\u5927\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u6821\u6b63\u5c0f\u7f13\u51b2\u6240\u8bf1\u53d1\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u79fb\u7b49\u7edf\u8ba1\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ee5\u6781\u5c0f\u56de\u653e\u4ee3\u4ef7\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the overpowering generative ability can sometimes hallucinate and thus change the image content despite gaining high visual quality. This type of high-level change can be easily identified by humans yet not well-studied in existing low-level image quality metrics. In this paper, we establish the importance of measuring high-level fidelity for SR models as a complementary criterion to reveal the reliability of generative SR models. We construct the first annotated dataset with fidelity scores from different SR models, and evaluate how state-of-the-art (SOTA) SR models actually perform in preserving high-level fidelity. Based on the dataset, we then analyze how existing image quality metrics correlate with fidelity measurement, and further show that this high-level task can be better addressed by foundation models. Finally, by fine-tuning SR models based on our fidelity feedback, we show that both semantic fidelity and perceptual quality can be improved, demonstrating the potential value of our proposed criteria, both in model evaluation and optimization. We will release the dataset, code, and models upon acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u9636\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5e26\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9002\u4e8e\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u5185\u5bb9\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u9636\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5e26\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30SOTA\u8d85\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\u5bf9SR\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u6d41\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982PSNR\u3001LPIPS\uff09\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9636\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\uff1b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u9636\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8d85\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Conventional traffic management strategies, including route guidance, ramp metering, and traffic signal control, often rely on state feedback controllers, used for their simplicity and reactivity; however, they lack the adaptability required to cope with complex and time-varying traffic dynamics. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which each agent adaptively tunes the parameters of a state feedback traffic controller, combining the reactivity of state feedback controllers with the adaptability of reinforcement learning. By tuning parameters at a lower frequency rather than directly determining control actions at a high frequency, the reinforcement learning agents achieve improved training efficiency while maintaining adaptability to varying traffic conditions. The multi-agent structure further enhances system robustness, as local controllers can operate independently in the event of partial failures. The proposed framework is evaluated on a simulated multi-class transportation network under varying traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed multi-agent framework outperforms the no control and fixed-parameter state feedback control cases, while performing on par with the single-agent RL-based adaptive state feedback control, with a much better resilience to partial failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u4ea4\u901a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5bf9\u65f6\u53d8\u4ea4\u901a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u5feb\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u3001\u65f6\u53d8\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u517c\u5177\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u8282\u672c\u5730\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9ad8\u9891\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u63a7\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u4ea4\u901a\u7f51\u7edc\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RL\u8c03\u53c2\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u901a\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5347\u7ea7\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this work, we present DAUNet, a novel lightweight UNet variant that integrates Deformable V2 Convolutions and Parameter-Free Attention (SimAM) to improve spatial adaptability and context-aware feature fusion without increasing model complexity. DAUNet's bottleneck employs dynamic deformable kernels to handle geometric variations, while the decoder and skip pathways are enhanced using SimAM attention modules for saliency-aware refinement. Extensive evaluations on two challenging datasets, FH-PS-AoP (fetal head and pubic symphysis ultrasound) and FUMPE (CT-based pulmonary embolism detection), demonstrate that DAUNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in Dice score, HD95, and ASD, while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.

However, conventional methods either searched from costly differentiable optimization, which is neither efficient nor flexible, or learned a quantized DNN from the proxy (i.e., HAWQ) manually designed by human experts, which is labor-intensive and requires huge expert knowledge. Can we design a proxy without involving any human experts and training? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer by proposing a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-driven Training-free Automatic Proxy (dubbed TAP) discovery framework, which reforms the design paradigm of MPQ by utilizing LLMs to find superior TAP tailored for MPQ, automatically. In addition, to bridge the gap between black-box LLMs and the tough MPQ task, we ingeniously propose simple Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) based reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' reasoning by optimizing prompts, which can construct a positive feedback loop between the LLM and the MPQ task, enabling LLMs to generate better TAP in the next evolution. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that TAP achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In this paper, we show that this stochastic noise corrupts fine-grained spatial cues and pushes the model toward timestep-specific noise objectives, consequently destroying meaningful geometric structure mappings. To address this, we introduce $\\mathrm{D}^{\\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor, a noise-free deterministic framework built by reformulating a pretrained diffusion model without stochasticity noise. Instead of relying on noisy inputs to leverage diffusion priors, $\\mathrm{D}^{\\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor views the pretrained diffusion network as an ensemble of timestep-dependent visual experts and self-supervisedly aggregates their heterogeneous priors into a single, clean, and complete geometric prior. Meanwhile, we utilize task-specific supervision to seamlessly adapt this noise-free prior to dense prediction tasks.

While HDC offers robustness and efficiency on graph-structured data, its fairness implications remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study fairness in graph HDC, where biases in data representation and decision rules can lead to unequal treatment of different groups. We show how hypervector encoding and similarity-based classification can propagate or even amplify such biases, and we propose a fairness-aware training framework, FairGHDC, to mitigate them. FairGHDC introduces a bias correction term, derived from a gap-based demographic-parity regularizer, and converts it into a scalar fairness factor that scales the update of the class hypervector for the ground-truth label. This enables debiasing directly in the hypervector space without modifying the graph encoder or requiring backpropagation. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairGHDC substantially reduces demographic-parity and equal-opportunity gaps while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard GNNs and fairness-aware GNNs. At the same time, FairGHDC preserves the computational advantages of HDC, achieving up to about one order of magnitude ($\\approx 10\\times$) speedup in training time on GPU compared to GNN and fairness-aware GNN baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFairGHDC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u8d85\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08HDC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8d85\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4fee\u6b63\u7c7b\u522b\u8d85\u5411\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5947\u5076\u6027\u548c\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u8d85\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08HDC\uff09\u867d\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u5f85\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFairGHDC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5947\u5076\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6807\u91cf\u516c\u5e73\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f29\u653e\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u5e94\u7c7b\u522b\u8d85\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u8d85\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6216\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFairGHDC\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5947\u5076\u6027\u548c\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6GNN\u53ca\u516c\u5e73\u6027GNN\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea610\u500d\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "FairGHDC\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u878d\u5165\u56feHDC\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301HDC\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Code is available at https://github.com/ImranAhsan23/F-E", "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly used to model complex patterns in graph-structured data. However, enabling them to \"forget\" designated information remains challenging, especially under privacy regulations such as the GDPR. Existing unlearning methods largely optimize for efficiency and scalability, yet they offer little transparency, and the black-box nature of GNNs makes it difficult to verify whether forgetting has truly occurred. We propose an explainability-driven verifier for GNN unlearning that snapshots the model before and after deletion, using attribution shifts and localized structural changes (for example, graph edit distance) as transparent evidence. The verifier uses five explainability metrics: residual attribution, heatmap shift, explainability score deviation, graph edit distance, and a diagnostic graph rule shift.

These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily.\n  We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency.\n  We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs. Strong performance across two very different domains confirms that DFIR-DETR generalizes well and works effectively in resource-limited settings for cross-scene small object detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDFIR-DETR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u9891\u57df\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u9000\u5316\u3001\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5197\u4f59\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728NEU-DET\u548cVisDrone\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9065\u611f\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u7a00\u758f\u5fae\u5f31\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u6742\u4e71\u53ca\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5267\u70c8\uff1b\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u964d\u7ea7\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u81a8\u80c0\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDFIR-DETR\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u6a21\u5757\uff1aDCFA\uff08\u52a8\u6001K\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b+\u7a7a\u95f4\u95e8\u63a7\u7ebf\u6027\u5355\u5143\uff09\u3001DFPN\uff08\u5e45\u503c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837+\u53cc\u8def\u5f84shuffle\u5377\u79ef\uff09\u3001FIRC3\uff08\u9891\u57df\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u878d\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u9891\u57df\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728NEU-DET\u548cVisDrone\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0amAP50\u5206\u522b\u8fbe92.9%\u548c51.6%\uff0c\u5747\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u4ec511.7M\u53c2\u6570\u300141.2 GFLOPs\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DFIR-DETR\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Combined Regularized Support Vector Machines (CR-SVMs) can effectively handle the structural information among data features, but there is a lack of efficient algorithms in distributed-stored big data. To address this issue, we propose a unified optimization framework based on consensus structure. This framework is not only applicable to various loss functions and combined regularization terms but can also be effectively extended to non-convex regularization terms, showing strong scalability. Based on this framework, we develop a distributed parallel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to efficiently compute CR-SVMs when data is stored in a distributed manner. To ensure the convergence of the algorithm, we also introduce the Gaussian back-substitution method. Meanwhile, for the integrity of the paper, we introduce a new model, the sparse group lasso support vector machine (SGL-SVM), and apply it to music information retrieval. Theoretical analysis confirms that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is not affected by different regularization terms and loss functions, highlighting the universality of the parallel algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and free music archiv datasets demonstrate the reliability, stability, and efficiency of the algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u8bc6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5e76\u884cADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08CR-SVM\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u56de\u4ee3\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u7ec4\u5957\u7d22SVM\uff08SGL-SVM\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u97f3\u4e50\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08CR-SVM\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u5927\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u8bc6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5e76\u884cADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u56de\u4ee3\u6cd5\u4fdd\u969c\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u7a00\u758f\u7ec4\u5957\u7d22SVM\uff08SGL-SVM\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u968f\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u548c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0eFree Music Archive\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e0bCR-SVM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3SGL-SVM\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u97f3\u4e50\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u3002"}}

While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have extended toward mesh reconstruction and physically-based rendering (PBR), their geometry is still learned from 2D renderings, leading to coarse surfaces and unreliable BRDF-lighting decomposition. To address these limitations, COREA introduces a coarse-to-fine bidirectional 3D-to-3D alignment strategy that allows geometric signals to be learned directly in 3D space.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream model, namely Multi-directional Similarity Network (MSN), to accurate and efficient copy-move forgery detection. It addresses the two major limitations of existing deep detection models in \\textbf{representation} and \\textbf{localization}, respectively. In representation, an image is hierarchically encoded by a multi-directional CNN network, and due to the diverse augmentation in scales and rotations, the feature achieved better measures the similarity between sampled patches in two streams. In localization, we design a 2-D similarity matrix based decoder, and compared with the current 1-D similarity vector based one, it makes full use of spatial information in the entire image, leading to the improvement in detecting tampered regions. Beyond the method, a new forgery database generated by various deep neural networks is presented, as a new benchmark for detecting the growing deep-synthesized copy-move.

Traditional approaches tackle such a problem by performing tensor singular value decomposition, which is computationally expensive and becomes infeasible for large-scale tensors. Recent approaches address this issue by factorizing the tensor into two smaller factor tensors and solving the resulting problem using gradient descent. However, this kind of approach requires an accurate estimate of the tensor rank, and when the rank is overestimated, the convergence of gradient descent and its variants slows down significantly or even diverges. To address this problem, we propose an Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent (APGD) algorithm, which accelerates convergence in the over-parameterized setting by adding a preconditioning term to the original gradient and updating these two factors alternately. Based on certain geometric assumptions on the objective function, we establish linear convergence guarantees for more general low-tubal-rank tensor estimation problems. Then we further analyze the specific cases of low-tubal-rank tensor factorization and low-tubal-rank tensor recovery. Our theoretical results show that APGD achieves linear convergence even under over-parameterization, and the convergence rate is independent of the tensor condition number.

Existing methods suffer from the discrepancies between the generated clothing results and the target ones, in terms of the patterns, textures and boundaries. Therefore, we propose to use an energy function to impose constraints on the attention map extracted through the generation process. Thus, at each generation step, the attention can be more focused on the clothing region of interest, thereby influencing the generation results to be more consistent with the target clothing details. Furthermore, to address the limitation that existing evaluation metrics concentrate solely on image realism and overlook the alignment with target elements, we design a new metric, Virtual Try-on Inception Distance (VTID), to bridge this gap and ensure a more comprehensive assessment. On the VITON-HD and DressCode datasets, our approach has outperformed the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 1.4%, 2.3%, 12.3%, and 5.8% in the traditional metrics of LPIPS, FID, KID, and the new VTID metrics, respectively. Additionally, by applying the generated data to downstream Clothing-Change Re-identification (CC-Reid) methods, we have achieved performance improvements of 2.5%, 1.1%, and 1.6% on the LTCC, PRCC, VC-Clothes datasets in the metrics of Rank-1.

It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence.

Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging region-proposal information to map visual regions with corresponding sentences from lengthy captions, yet incurring notable deployment costs. We introduce MulCLIP, a novel end-to-end multi-level alignment framework that bridges natural long-text structures with image components. MulCLIP first preserves global contrastive alignment between images and both summary and long captions, while extending positional embeddings for longer text sequences. To further enhance fine-grained understanding, we propose two novel strategies: (1) a token reconstruction alignment over locally calibrated features to strengthen semantic connections between words and image patches, and (2) a subcaption-aggregated patch alignment that automatically extracts and aggregates context-rich patches for each subcaption. Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate our method consistently improves downstream performance, while ablation studies confirm its multi-scale alignment is the key factor driving better fine-grained capability than region-proposal-assisted approaches, making it particularly suitable for diverse real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "MulCLIP\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u8bcd\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5b50\u6807\u9898\u805a\u5408\u8865\u4e01\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u77ed\u6807\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u800c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u8bae\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u4f46\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "MulCLIP\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u4fdd\u7559\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6458\u8981/\u957f\u6807\u9898\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u6587\u672c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u8bcd\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u8bcd\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b50\u6807\u9898\u805a\u5408\u8865\u4e01\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5bf9\u5e94\u5404\u5b50\u6807\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMulCLIP\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u662f\u4f18\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u8bae\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MulCLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

It covers an introduction to machine learning and describes various theoretical advances and practical projects in the field. The Lecture here is presented in its original format, but a few remarks have been added in 2025 to reflect recent developments, and the list of references has been updated to enhance the convenience and accuracy for readers.\n  When did machine learning start? Maybe a good starting point is 1949, when Claude Shannon proposed a learning algorithm for chess-playing programs. Or maybe we should go back to the 1930s when Ronald Fisher developed discriminant analysis - a type of learning where the problem is to construct a decision rule that separates two types of vectors. Or could it be the 18th century when David Hume discussed the idea of induction? Or the 14th century, when William of Ockham formulated the principle of \"simplicity\" known as \"Ockham's razor\" (Ockham, by the way, is a small village not far from Royal Holloway). Or it may be that, like almost everything else in Western civilisation and culture, the origin of these ideas lies in the Mediterranean.

Previous work has demonstrated that models can achieve better planning performance when provided with a prior distribution of possible trajectories. However, these approaches often overlook two critical aspects: 1) The appropriate trajectory prior can vary significantly across different driving scenarios. 2) Their trajectory evaluation mechanism lacks policy-driven refinement, remaining constrained by the limitations of one-stage supervised training. To address these issues, we explore improvements in two key areas. For problem 1, we employ MoE to apply different trajectory priors tailored to different scenarios. For problem 2, we utilize Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune the trajectory scoring mechanism. Additionally, we integrate models with different perception backbones to enhance perceptual features.

In such settings, conventional model-learning methods are fundamentally inconsistent, as the transition and reward mechanisms generated under a behavioral policy do not correspond to the interventional quantities required for evaluating a state-based policy. To address this issue, we adapt a proximal off-policy evaluation approach that identifies the confounded reward expectation using only observable state-action-reward trajectories under mild invertibility conditions on proxy variables. When combined with a behavior-averaged transition model, this construction yields a surrogate MDP whose Bellman operator is well defined and consistent for state-based policies, and which integrates seamlessly with the maximum causal entropy (MaxCausalEnt) model-learning framework.

Beyond recognition, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable detailed descriptions and causal reasoning, motivating new tasks: human action understanding (HAU) and human action reasoning (HARn). However, most LLMs, especially large vision language models (LVLMs), struggle with non-RGB modalities such as depth, IMU, and mmWave due to the lack of large-scale data-caption resources. Existing HAR datasets mainly provide coarse data-label annotations, which are insufficient to capture fine-grained action dynamics needed for HAU and HARn. We consider two ground-truth pair types: (1) data label (discrete category) and (2) data caption (textual description). Naively generating captions from labels often lacks logical and spatiotemporal consistency. We introduce CUHK-X, a large-scale multimodal dataset and benchmark suite for HAR, HAU, and HARn. CUHK-X contains 58,445 samples covering 40 actions performed by 30 participants across two indoor environments. To improve caption consistency, we propose a prompt-based scene creation method that leverages LLMs to generate logically connected activity sequences, followed by human validation. CUHK-X includes three benchmarks with six evaluation tasks. Experiments report average accuracies of 76.52% (HAR), 40.76% (HAU), and 70.25% (HARn). CUHK-X aims to enable the community to apply and develop data-intensive learning methods for robust, multimodal human activity analysis.

We introduce RRAEDy, a model that removes these limitations by discovering the appropriate latent dimension, while enforcing both regularized and linearized dynamics in the latent space. Built upon Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (RRAEs), RRAEDy automatically rank and prune latent variables through their singular values while learning a latent Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) operator that governs their temporal progression. This structure-free yet linearly constrained formulation enables the model to learn stable and low-dimensional dynamics without auxiliary losses or manual tuning. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the stability of the learned operator and showcase the generality of our model by proposing an extension that handles parametric ODEs. Experiments on canonical benchmarks, including the Van der Pol oscillator, Burgers' equation, 2D Navier-Stokes, and Rotating Gaussians, show that RRAEDy achieves accurate and robust predictions.

Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition.

However, RLVR often leads to entropy collapse, resulting in premature policy convergence and performance saturation. While manipulating token-level entropy has proven effective for promoting policy exploration, we argue that the latent dynamics underlying token generation encode a far richer computational structure for steering policy optimization toward a more effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To enable tractable analysis and intervention of the latent dynamics of LRMs, we leverage Koopman operator theory to obtain a linearized representation of their hidden-state dynamics. This enables us to introduce Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD), a new metric to quantify the heterogeneity of the model's latent dynamics, serving as a direct indicator of policy exploration. Building upon these foundations, we propose Reasoning with Latent eXploration (ReLaX), a paradigm that explicitly incorporates latent dynamics to regulate exploration and exploitation during policy optimization. Comprehensive experiments across a wide range of multimodal and text-only reasoning benchmarks show that ReLaX significantly mitigates premature convergence and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faReLaX\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRM\uff09\u7684\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u52a8\u6001\u8c31\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\uff08DSD\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6765\u6539\u5584\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u71b5\u574d\u584c\u4e0e\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "RLVR\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRM\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u71b5\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9971\u548c\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7ea7\u71b5\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9LRM\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u8c31\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\uff08DSD\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u9690\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1Reasoning with Latent eXploration\uff08ReLaX\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u8c03\u63a7\u9690\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cReLaX\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u6bd4token\u7ea7\u71b5\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\u3001\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u8c03\u63a7\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1bReLaX\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RLVR\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While recent pose-free feed-forward methods leveraging pre-trained 3D priors have achieved impressive results, most of them rely on full fine-tuning of large Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones and incur substantial GPU costs. In this work, we introduce MuSASplat, a novel framework that dramatically reduces the computational burden of training pose-free feed-forward 3D Gaussian splats models with little compromise of rendering quality. Central to our approach is a lightweight Multi-Scale Adapter that enables efficient fine-tuning of ViT-based architectures with only a small fraction of training parameters. This design avoids the prohibitive GPU overhead associated with previous full-model adaptation techniques while maintaining high fidelity in novel view synthesis, even with very sparse input views. In addition, we introduce a Feature Fusion Aggregator that integrates features across input views effectively and efficiently. Unlike widely adopted memory banks, the Feature Fusion Aggregator ensures consistent geometric integration across input views and meanwhile mitigates the memory usage, training complexity, and computational costs significantly. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that MuSASplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality but has significantly reduced parameters and training resource requirements as compared with existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MuSASplat\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u805a\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4eGPU\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec33D\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u65e0\u59ff\u6001\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578bViT\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u6602GPU\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMuSASplat\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914dViT\uff1b2\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u805a\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u5185\u5b58\u5e93\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "MuSASplat\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d23D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u53163D\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We first bridge this research gap by contributing the SPPE (Surrogate Privacy Protected Editable) dataset, which includes a wide range of privacy categories and user instructions to simulate real MLLM applications. This dataset offers protected surrogates alongside their various MLLM-edited versions, thus enabling the direct assessment of privacy recovery quality. By formulating privacy recovery as a guided generation task conditioned on complementary multimodal signals, we further introduce a unified approach that reliably reconstructs private content while preserving the fidelity of MLLM-generated edits.

Prior benchmarks show that machine learning and deep learning models provide only modest gains over statistical baselines, mainly due to the sparsity and heterogeneity of the DF time series. We investigate Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), large pre-trained models for generic time series, as an alternative for PMF. Using DF time series derived from real-life event logs, we compare zero-shot use of TSFMs, without additional training, with fine-tuned variants adapted on PMF-specific data. TSFMs generally achieve lower forecasting errors (MAE and RMSE) than traditional and specialized models trained from scratch on the same logs, indicating effective transfer of temporal structure from non-process domains. While fine-tuning can further improve accuracy, the gains are often small and may disappear on smaller or more complex datasets, so zero-shot use remains a strong default.

Most current fusion networks are tailored to specific tasks and lack the ability to flexibly incorporate user intent, especially in complex scenarios involving low-light degradation, color shifts, or exposure imbalance. Moreover, the absence of ground-truth fused images and the small scale of existing datasets make it difficult to train an end-to-end model that simultaneously understands high-level semantics and performs fine-grained multimodal alignment. We therefore present DiTFuse, instruction-driven Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) framework that performs end-to-end, semantics-aware fusion within a single model. By jointly encoding two images and natural-language instructions in a shared latent space, DiTFuse enables hierarchical and fine-grained control over fusion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of pre-fusion and post-fusion pipelines that struggle to inject high-level semantics. The training phase employs a multi-degradation masked-image modeling strategy, so the network jointly learns cross-modal alignment, modality-invariant restoration, and task-aware feature selection without relying on ground truth images. A curated, multi-granularity instruction dataset further equips the model with interactive fusion capabilities.

Existing methods typically apply uniform restoration strategies across the entire image, struggling to handle multiple co-occurring degradations that vary spatially and with water conditions. We introduce TIDE, a $\\underline{t}$wo stage $\\underline{i}$nverse $\\underline{d}$egradation $\\underline{e}$stimation framework that explicitly models degradation characteristics and applies targeted restoration through specialized prior decomposition. Our approach disentangles the restoration process into multiple specialized hypotheses that are adaptively fused based on local degradation patterns, followed by a progressive refinement stage that corrects residual artifacts. Specifically, TIDE decomposes underwater degradations into four key factors, namely color distortion, haze, detail loss, and noise, and designs restoration experts specialized for each. By generating specialized restoration hypotheses, TIDE balances competing degradation factors and produces natural results even in highly degraded regions. Extensive experiments across both standard benchmarks and challenging turbid water conditions show that TIDE achieves competitive performance on reference based fidelity metrics while outperforming state of the art methods on non reference perceptual quality metrics, with strong improvements in color correction and contrast enhancement.

Existing approaches largely optimize factual correctness or depend on retraining and brittle single-layer edits, offering limited leverage over truthful reporting. We present a training-free activation steering method that weights steering strength across network depth using a Gaussian schedule. On the MASK benchmark, which separates honesty from knowledge, we evaluate seven models spanning the LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral families and find that Gaussian scheduling improves honesty over no-steering and single-layer baselines in six of seven models. Equal-budget ablations on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct show the Gaussian schedule outperforms random, uniform, and box-filter depth allocations, indicating that how intervention is distributed across depth materially affects outcomes beyond total strength. The method is simple, model-agnostic, requires no finetuning, and provides a low-cost control knob for eliciting truthful reporting from models' existing capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5206\u914d\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\uff08\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u9648\u8ff0\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5df2\u5177\u5907\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u2018\u4e0d\u8bda\u5b9e\u2019\u95ee\u9898\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5355\u5c42\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u5206\u914d\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u8bda\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684MASK\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57287\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u76846\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5355\u5c42\u5f15\u5bfc\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct\u548cQwen-2.5-7B-Instruct\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u9884\u7b97\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u8c03\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u3001\u5747\u5300\u53ca\u76d2\u5f0f\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5bfc\u5e72\u9884\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u5f0f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u8c03\u5ea6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6fc0\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u9648\u8ff0\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Unlike natural images, charts pair a structured visual layout (spatial property) with an underlying data representation (textual property) -- grasping both is essential for precise, fine-grained chart reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose START, the Spatial and Textual learning for chART understanding. Specifically, we introduce (i) chart-element grounding and (ii) chart-to-code generation to strengthen an MLLM's understanding of both chart visual layout and data details. To facilitate spatial and textual learning, we propose the START-Dataset generated with a novel data-generation pipeline that first leverages an MLLM to translate real chart images into executable chart code, recovering the underlying data representation while preserving the visual distribution of real-world charts. We then evolve the code with a Large Language Model (LLM) to ascertain the positions of chart elements that capture the chart's visual structure, addressing challenges that existing methods cannot handle. To evaluate a model's ability to understand chart spatial structures, we propose the Chart Spatial understanding Benchmark (CS-Bench), filling a critical gap in comprehensive chart understanding evaluation. Leveraging spatial and textual learning, START delivers consistent gains across model sizes and benchmarks over the base models and surpasses prior state-of-the-art by a clear margin.

In this work, we study SGD's impact on generalization through the lens of the statistical bootstrap: SGD uses gradient variability under batch sampling as a proxy for solution variability under the randomness of the data collection process. We use empirical results and theoretical analysis to substantiate this claim. In idealized experiments on empirical risk minimization, we show that SGD is drawn to parameter choices that are robust under resampling and thus avoids spurious solutions even if they lie in wider and deeper minima of the training loss. We prove rigorously that by implicitly regularizing the trace of the gradient covariance matrix, SGD controls the algorithmic variability. This regularization leads to solutions that are less sensitive to sampling noise, thereby improving generalization. Numerical experiments on neural network training show that explicitly incorporating the estimate of the algorithmic variability as a regularizer improves test performance. This fact supports our claim that bootstrap estimation underpins SGD's generalization advantages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSGD\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9690\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0bootstrap\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9690\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u68af\u5ea6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u8ff9\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u663e\u5f0f\u52a0\u5165\u8be5\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08SGD\uff09\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08GD\uff09\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7edf\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1bootstrap\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u5c06SGD\u4e2d\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u60f3\u5316ERM\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff08\u8bc1\u660eSGD\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u8ff9\uff09\u53ca\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0SGD\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u89e3\uff0c\u907f\u5f00\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u5bbd\u800c\u6df1\u4f46\u865a\u5047\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u9690\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u52a0\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SGD\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u9690\u5f0f\u6267\u884cbootstrap\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5373\u5229\u7528\u6279\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u89e3\u3002"}}

Chen"], "title": "Integrating Multi-scale and Multi-filtration Topological Features for Medical Image Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern deep neural networks have shown remarkable performance in medical image classification. However, such networks either emphasize pixel-intensity features instead of fundamental anatomical structures (e.g., those encoded by topological invariants), or they capture only simple topological features via single-parameter persistence. In this paper, we propose a new topology-guided classification framework that extracts multi-scale and multi-filtration persistent topological features and integrates them into vision classification backbones. For an input image, we first compute cubical persistence diagrams (PDs) across multiple image resolutions/scales. We then develop a ``vineyard'' algorithm that consolidates these PDs into a single, stable diagram capturing signatures at varying granularities, from global anatomy to subtle local irregularities that may indicate early-stage disease. To further exploit richer topological representations produced by multiple filtrations, we design a cross-attention-based neural network that directly processes the consolidated final PDs.

Traditional level set methods, while effective in certain cases, often depend on approximate bias field estimations and therefore struggle under severe non-uniform imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel variational Reflectance-based Level Set Model (RefLSM), which explicitly integrates Retinex-inspired reflectance decomposition into the segmentation framework. By decomposing the observed image into reflectance and bias field components, RefLSM directly segments the reflectance, which is invariant to illumination and preserves fine structural details. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key innovations for enhanced precision and robustness. First, a linear structural prior steers the smoothed reflectance gradients toward a data-driven reference, providing reliable geometric guidance in noisy or low-contrast scenes. Second, a relaxed binary level-set is embedded in RefLSM and enforced via convex relaxation and sign projection, yielding stable evolution and avoiding reinitialization-induced diffusion. The resulting variational problem is solved efficiently using an ADMM-based optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrate that RefLSM achieves superior segmentation accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art level set methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eRetinex\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u53d8\u5206\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\uff08RefLSM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u5728\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u8fb9\u754c\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd1\u4f3c\u504f\u7f6e\u573a\u4f30\u8ba1\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReflectance-based Level Set Model\uff08RefLSM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06Retinex\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u663e\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u68af\u5ea6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u677e\u5f1b\u4e8c\u503c\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u6295\u5f71\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528ADMM\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u53d8\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRefLSM\u5728\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RefLSM\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, these methods typically estimate the entropy of VQ indices using a static, global probability distribution, which fails to adapt to the specific content of each image. This non-adaptive approach leads to untapped bitrate potential and challenges in achieving flexible rate control. To address this challenge, we introduce a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework based on a VQ Hyperprior, termed HVQ-CGIC. HVQ-CGIC rigorously derives the mathematical foundation for introducing a hyperprior to the VQ indices entropy model. Based on this foundation, through novel loss design, to our knowledge, this framework is the first to introduce RD balance and control into vector quantization-based Generative Image Compression. Cooperating with a lightweight hyper-prior estimation network, HVQ-CGIC achieves a significant advantage in rate-distortion (RD) performance compared to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative compression methods. On the Kodak dataset, we achieve the same LPIPS as Control-GIC, CDC and HiFiC with an average of 61.3% fewer bits.

Weighing and integrating these different information sources is a challenging task and a good candidate for support by intelligence-driven tools - however this is yet to be realized in the clinic. Here, we argue that several important barriers to adoption can be addressed using Bayesian network modelling. To demonstrate this, we evaluate a model for depression and anxiety symptom prediction from voice and speech features in large-scale datasets (30,135 unique speakers). Alongside performance for conditions and symptoms (for depression, anxiety ROC-AUC=0.842,0.831 ECE=0.018,0.015; core individual symptom ROC-AUC>0.74), we assess demographic fairness and investigate integration across and redundancy between different input modality types. Clinical usefulness metrics and acceptability to mental health service users are explored. When provided with sufficiently rich and large-scale multimodal data streams and specified to represent common mental conditions at the symptom rather than disorder level, such models are a principled approach for building robust assessment support tools: providing clinically-relevant outputs in a transparent and explainable format that is directly amenable to expert clinical supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u8a00\u8bed\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u6291\u90c1\u4e0e\u7126\u8651\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0830,135\u540d\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08ROC-AUC\u8fbe0.842/0.831\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5173\u6ce8\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u795e\u79d1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u9700\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u8c03\u3001\u8bed\u901f\u3001\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u3001\u80a2\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u73b0\u6709AI\u5de5\u5177\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\uff0c\u4e3b\u56e0\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u8a00\u8bed\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u75c7\u72b6\u7ea7\uff08\u800c\u975e\u75be\u75c5\u7ea7\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u6291\u90c1\u4e0e\u7126\u8651\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u7814\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6291\u90c1\u4e0e\u7126\u8651\u9884\u6d4bROC-AUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.842\u548c0.831\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff08ECE\uff09\u4f4e\uff080.018/0.015\uff09\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u5355\u75c7\u72b6AUC\u5747>0.74\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4fbf\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u75c7\u72b6\u4e3a\u7c92\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u5065\u5eb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, its practical use is hindered by the massive memory and computational demands required to store and render millions of Gaussians. These challenges become even more severe in 4D dynamic scenes. To address these issues, the field of Efficient Gaussian Splatting has rapidly evolved, proposing methods that reduce redundancy while preserving reconstruction quality. This survey provides the first unified overview of efficient 3D and 4D Gaussian Splatting techniques.

Sliding Window Attention (SWA) achieves linear-time encoding/decoding by constraining the attention pattern, but under an \\textit{Associative Memory} interpretation, its difference-style update renders the training objective effectively \\emph{unbounded}. In contrast, Softmax attention normalizes updates, leading to \\emph{memory shrinkage and gradient vanishing}.

In essence, GatedFWA accumulate a per-token/head gate into a decay bias added to the attention logits, acting as a learnable contraction in the memory recurrence. We implement a fused one-pass gate preprocessing and a FlashAttention-compatible kernel that injects the gate under a sliding mask, ensuring I/O efficiency and numerical stability.

We introduce MMRPT, a masked multimodal reinforcement pre-training framework that strengthens visual reasoning in MLLMs. We are the first to incorporate reinforcement learning directly into the pre-training of large vision-language models, enabling learning signals that reward visual grounding rather than caption imitation. MMRPT constructs masked multimodal data by estimating sentence-level visual dependency via attention over visual tokens and masking highly vision-dependent segments; the model reconstructs these spans through vision-grounded reasoning guided by a semantic-visual reward. Experiments show consistent zero-shot gains across diverse benchmarks and substantially improved robustness under supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating that reinforcement-driven masked reasoning provides a more reliable and generalizable pre-training objective for multimodal models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMMRPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u9762\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u89c6\u89c9 grounding\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMMRPT\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9token\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63a9\u7801\u9ad8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49-\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9 grounded \u7684\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Methods: The AutoLugano system processes baseline FDG-PET/CT scans through three sequential modules:(1) Anatomy-Informed Lesion Segmentation, a 3D nnU-Net model, trained on multi-channel inputs, performs automated lesion detection (2) Atlas-based Anatomical Localization, which leverages the TotalSegmentator toolkit to map segmented lesions to 21 predefined lymph node regions using deterministic anatomical rules; and (3) Automated Lugano Staging, where the spatial distribution of involved regions is translated into Lugano stages and therapeutic groups (Limited vs. Advanced Stage).The system was trained on the public autoPET dataset (n=1,007) and externally validated on an independent cohort of 67 patients. Performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-scorefor regional involvement detection and staging agreement. Results: On the external validation set, the proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.31%, sensitivity of 74.47%, Specificity of 94.21% and an F1-score of 80.80% for regional involvement detection,outperforming baseline models. Most notably, for the critical clinical task of therapeutic stratification (Limited vs. Advanced Stage), the system achieved a high accuracy of 85.07%, with a specificity of 90.48% and a sensitivity of 82.61%.Conclusion: AutoLugano represents the first fully automated, end-to-end pipeline that translates a single baseline FDG-PET/CT scan into a complete Lugano stage.

Our analysis centers on Comet, an AI-powered browser developed by Perplexity, and its integrated agent, Comet Assistant. Drawing on hundreds of millions of anonymized user interactions, we address three fundamental questions: Who is using AI agents? How intensively are they using them? And what are they using them for? Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task. The two largest topics, Productivity & Workflow and Learning & Research, account for 57% of all agentic queries, while the two largest subtopics, Courses and Shopping for Goods, make up 22%.

However, a single estimate cannot capture pose uncertainty deriving from visual ambiguity, which can lead to unreliable behavior. Existing pose distribution methods rely heavily on color information, often unavailable in industrial settings.\n  We propose a novel neural network-based method for estimating object pose uncertainty using only 3D colorless data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that leverages deep learning for pose distribution estimation without relying on RGB input. We validate our method in a real-world bin picking scenario with objects of varying geometric ambiguity. Our current implementation focuses on symmetries in reflection and revolution, but the framework is extendable to full SE(3) pose distribution estimation.

A common defence embeds invisible perturbations into images, but these are fragile and often destroyed by basic transformations such as compression or resizing. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 30 transformations across six categories and show that protection robustness is highly sensitive to the choice of training transformations, making the standard Expectation over Transformation (EOT) with uniform sampling fundamentally suboptimal. Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice. Specifically, EOLT employs a policy network that learns to automatically prioritize critical transformations and adaptively generate instance-specific perturbations via reinforcement learning, enabling explicit modeling of defensive bottlenecks while maintaining broad transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, with 26% higher average robustness and up to 30% gains on challenging transformation categories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEOLT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347DeepFake\u9632\u5fa1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u53d8\u6362\uff08EOT\uff09\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u6362\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u9700\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u591a\u6837\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faExpectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation\uff08EOLT\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u572830\u79cd\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u516d\u5927\u7c7b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u534726%\uff0c\u5728\u96be\u53d8\u6362\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534730%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u5e03\u8bbe\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u9632\u5fa1\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cEOLT\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684DeepFake\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Previous studies often treat each class independently, neglecting the inherent inter-class relations. Obtaining such inter-class relations directly presents a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose ReLKD, an end-to-end framework that effectively exploits implicit inter-class relations and leverages this knowledge to enhance the classification of novel classes. ReLKD comprises three key modules: a target-grained module for learning discriminative representations, a coarse-grained module for capturing hierarchical class relations, and a distillation module for transferring knowledge from the coarse-grained module to refine the target-grained module's representation learning. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLKD, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.

STRinGS results in a 63.6% relative improvement over 3DGS at just 7K iterations.

Yet, endoscopic videos are often degraded by uneven illumination, tissue scattering, occlusions, and motion blur, which obscure critical anatomical details and complicate surgical manipulation. Although deep learning-based methods have shown promise in image enhancement, most existing approaches remain too computationally demanding for real-time surgical use. To address this challenge, we propose a degradation-aware framework for endoscopic video enhancement, which enables real-time, high-quality enhancement by propagating degradation representations across frames. In our framework, degradation representations are first extracted from images using contrastive learning. We then introduce a fusion mechanism that modulates image features with these representations to guide a single-frame enhancement model, which is trained with a cycle-consistency constraint between degraded and restored images to improve robustness and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing camera encoding methods often rely on simplified pinhole assumptions, restricting generalization across the diverse intrinsics and lens distortions in real-world cameras. We introduce Relative Ray Encoding, a geometry-consistent representation that unifies complete camera information, including 6-DoF poses, intrinsics, and lens distortions. To evaluate its capability under diverse controllability demands, we adopt camera-controlled text-to-video generation as a testbed task. Within this setting, we further identify pitch and roll as two components effective for Absolute Orientation Encoding, enabling full control over the initial camera orientation. Together, these designs form UCPE (Unified Camera Positional Encoding), which integrates into a pretrained video Diffusion Transformer through a lightweight spatial attention adapter, adding less than 1% trainable parameters while achieving state-of-the-art camera controllability and visual fidelity. To facilitate systematic training and evaluation, we construct a large video dataset covering a wide range of camera motions and lens types. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UCPE in camera-controllable video generation and highlight its potential as a general camera representation for Transformers across future multi-view, video, and 3D tasks.

By introducing a Multi-Resolution Multi-Channel Fusion (MRCF) module, our method captures cross-scale features, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the extracted information. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Mix Attention Module (CMAM), which redefines the attention scope and dynamically calculates weights across multiple contexts, thus improving the flexibility and depth of feature capture and enabling deeper exploration of subtle features. To overcome the information loss caused by skip connections in traditional U-Net, an External Attention Bridge (EAB) is introduced, facilitating the effective utilization of information in the decoder and compensating for the loss during upsampling.

Even with the promotion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the process of tumor delineation is difficult and time-consuming, which is prone to inter-observer error. In order to overcome these limitations, this work proposes a hybrid deep learning model based on SqueezeNet v1 which is a lightweight model, and EfficientNet-B0, which is a high-performing model, and is enhanced with handcrafted radiomic descriptors, including Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor filters and Wavelet transforms. The framework was trained and tested only on publicly available Nickparvar Brain Tumor MRI dataset, which consisted of 7,023 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial MRI slices which were categorized into four groups: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The testing accuracy of the model was 98.93% that reached a level of 99.08% with Test Time Augmentation (TTA) showing great generalization and power.

We propose TEXTER, which overcomes this limitation by isolating decision-critical features before alignment.

It then maps these emphasized features into the CLIP feature space to retrieve textual explanations that reflect the model's reasoning.

However, such methods face limitations when applied to UAV imagery, which presents challenges like target confusion, scale variations, and complex backgrounds. These challenges arise because VLMs' understanding of image content depends on the semantic alignment between visual and textual tokens. When the task prompt is simplistic and the image content is complex, achieving effective alignment becomes difficult, limiting the model's ability to focus on task-relevant information. To address this issue, we introduce AerialVP, the first agent framework for task prompt enhancement in UAV image perception. AerialVP proactively extracts multi-dimensional auxiliary information from UAV images to enhance task prompts, overcoming the limitations of traditional VLM-based approaches. Specifically, the enhancement process includes three stages: (1) analyzing the task prompt to identify the task type and enhancement needs, (2) selecting appropriate tools from the tool repository, and (3) generating enhanced task prompts based on the analysis and selected tools. To evaluate AerialVP, we introduce AerialSense, a comprehensive benchmark for UAV image perception that includes Aerial Visual Reasoning, Aerial Visual Question Answering, and Aerial Visual Grounding tasks. AerialSense provides a standardized basis for evaluating model generalization and performance across diverse resolutions, lighting conditions, and both urban and natural scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that AerialVP significantly enhances task prompt guidance, leading to stable and substantial performance improvements in both open-source and proprietary VLMs. Our work will be available at https://github.com/lostwolves/AerialVP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAerialVP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ece\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u7ef4\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5f71\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6AerialSense\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u76ee\u6807\u6df7\u6dc6\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u4e4b\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u63d0\u793a\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAerialVP\u2014\u2014\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a(1)\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u9700\u6c42\uff1b(2)\u4ece\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u5de5\u5177\uff1b(3)\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efaAerialSense\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAerialVP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u5546\u7528VLM\u4e0a\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "AerialVP\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86VLM\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u56e0\u63d0\u793a-\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, it also exposes these assets to serious risks of unauthorized editing and malicious tampering. Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation.

Existing personalization methods often focus on facial identity but fail to preserve broader contextual cues such as hairstyle, outfit, and body shape, which are critical for visual coherence. We propose \\textbf{ContextAnyone}, a context-aware diffusion framework that achieves character-consistent video generation from text and a single reference image. Our method jointly reconstructs the reference image and generates new video frames, enabling the model to fully perceive and utilize reference information. Reference information is effectively integrated into a DiT-based diffusion backbone through a novel Emphasize-Attention module that selectively reinforces reference-aware features and prevents identity drift across frames. A dual-guidance loss combines diffusion and reference reconstruction objectives to enhance appearance fidelity, while the proposed Gap-RoPE positional embedding separates reference and video tokens to stabilize temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that ContextAnyone outperforms existing reference-to-video methods in identity consistency and visual quality, generating coherent and context-preserving character videos across diverse motions and scenes.

In medical imaging, it can support clinical decision-making, but current models often over-edit. This can distort organs, create false findings, and miss small tumors because these models do not understand anatomy or contrast dynamics. We propose SMILE, an anatomy-aware diffusion model that learns how organs are shaped and how they take up contrast. It enhances only clinically relevant regions while leaving all other areas unchanged. SMILE introduces three key ideas: (1) structure-aware supervision that follows true organ boundaries and contrast patterns; (2) registration-free learning that works directly with unaligned multi-phase CT scans; (3) unified inference that provides fast and consistent enhancement across all contrast phases. Across six external datasets, SMILE outperforms existing methods in image quality (14.2% higher SSIM, 20.6% higher PSNR, 50% better FID) and in clinical usefulness by producing anatomically accurate and diagnostically meaningful images.

Mohamed", "Md Rafiqul Islam", "Asif Karim", "Sami Azam"], "title": "DeepAgent: A Dual Stream Multi Agent Fusion for Robust Multimodal Deepfake Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "The increasing use of synthetic media, particularly deepfakes, is an emerging challenge for digital content verification. Although recent studies use both audio and visual information, most integrate these cues within a single model, which remains vulnerable to modality mismatches, noise, and manipulation. To address this gap, we propose DeepAgent, an advanced multi-agent collaboration framework that simultaneously incorporates both visual and audio modalities for the effective detection of deepfakes. DeepAgent consists of two complementary agents. Agent-1 examines each video with a streamlined AlexNet-based CNN to identify the symbols of deepfake manipulation, while Agent-2 detects audio-visual inconsistencies by combining acoustic features, audio transcriptions from Whisper, and frame-reading sequences of images through EasyOCR. Their decisions are fused through a Random Forest meta-classifier that improves final performance by taking advantage of the different decision boundaries learned by each agent. This study evaluates the proposed framework using three benchmark datasets to demonstrate both component-level and fused performance. Agent-1 achieves a test accuracy of 94.35% on the combined Celeb-DF and FakeAVCeleb datasets. On the FakeAVCeleb dataset, Agent-2 and the final meta-classifier attain accuracies of 93.69% and 81.56%, respectively. In addition, cross-dataset validation on DeepFakeTIMIT confirms the robustness of the meta-classifier, which achieves a final accuracy of 97.49%, and indicates a strong capability across diverse datasets.

This more cost-effective approach uses deep learning for object detection and instance segmentation of the objects, and employs user-defined heuristics or rules to infer their relations.

However, due to CLIP's pre-training nature on image-text pairs, it tends to focus on global semantic alignment, resulting in suboptimal performance when associating fine-grained visual regions with text. This leads to noisy and inconsistent predictions, particularly in local areas. We attribute this to a dispersed bias stemming from its contrastive training paradigm, which is difficult to alleviate using CLIP features alone. To address this, we propose a structure-aware feature rectification approach that incorporates instance-specific priors derived directly from the image. Specifically, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on low-level features (e.g., colour and texture) to capture local structural relationships and use it to refine CLIP features by enhancing local discrimination.

To address these issues, we propose a three-stage **r**einforcing **v**ision-**l**anguage **f**ramework (**RVLF**). We build a large vision-language model (LVLM) specifically designed for sign language, and then combine it with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance translation performance. First, for a sufficient representation of sign language, RVLF introduces an effective semantic representation learning mechanism that fuses skeleton-based motion cues with semantically rich visual features extracted via DINOv2, followed by instruction tuning to obtain a strong SLT-SFT baseline. Then, to improve sentence-level semantic misalignment, we introduce a GRPO-based optimization strategy that fine-tunes the SLT-SFT model with a reward function combining translation fidelity (BLEU) and sentence completeness (ROUGE), yielding the optimized model termed SLT-GRPO. Our conceptually simple framework yields substantial gains under the gloss-free SLT setting without pre-training on any external large-scale sign language datasets, improving BLEU-4 scores by +5.1, +1.11, +1.4, and +1.61 on the CSL-Daily, PHOENIX-2014T, How2Sign, and OpenASL datasets, respectively.

Current methodologies depend on costly, specialized sensors (e.g., LiDAR and multispectral), which restrict global accessibility. Existing sensor-based and rule-driven methods further struggle with tasks requiring the integration of multiple 3D cues, handling diverse queries, and providing interpretable reasoning. We hereby present Geo3DVQA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in height-aware, 3D geospatial reasoning using RGB-only remote sensing imagery. Unlike conventional sensor-based frameworks, Geo3DVQA emphasizes realistic scenarios that integrate elevation, sky view factors, and land cover patterns. The benchmark encompasses 110k curated question-answer pairs spanning 16 task categories across three complexity levels: single-feature inference, multi-feature reasoning, and application-level spatial analysis. The evaluation of ten state-of-the-art VLMs highlights the difficulty of RGB-to-3D reasoning. GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash achieved only 28.6% and 33.0% accuracy respectively, while domain-specific fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B achieved 49.6% (+24.8 points). These results reveal both the limitations of current VLMs and the effectiveness of domain adaptation.

Important examples of applications include crowd simulation and emergency management, where the simulation of the mass of people passes through the simulation of the individuals, taking into consideration the others as part of the general context. While existing solutions basically start from some preconceived behavioural model, in this work we propose an approach that starts directly from the data, adopting a data mining perspective. Our method searches the mobility events in the data that might be possible evidences of mutual interactions between individuals, and on top of them looks for complex, persistent patterns and time evolving configurations of events. The study of these patterns can provide new insights on the mechanics of mobility interactions between individuals, which can potentially help in improving existing simulation models.

Increasingly driven by deep learning, these models learn to approximate data distributions from training examples. This often results in outputs that gravitate toward the average, potentially masking diagnostically important features. More critically, they can introduce hallucinated content, artifacts that appear realistic but are not present in the original tissue, posing a serious threat to downstream analysis. These hallucinations are nearly impossible to detect visually, and current evaluation practices often overlook them. In this work, we demonstrate that the risk of hallucinations is real and underappreciated. While many methods perform adequately on public datasets, we observe a concerning frequency of hallucinations when these same models are retrained and evaluated on real-world clinical data. To address this, we propose a novel image comparison measure designed to automatically detect hallucinations in normalized outputs. Using this measure, we systematically evaluate several well-cited normalization methods retrained on real-world data, revealing significant inconsistencies and failures that are not captured by conventional metrics.

Considering aerial imagery (e.g., modern aerial photos collected through drones, historical photos from aerial archives, high-resolution satellite imagery, etc.) presents unique challenges because spatial resolution varies widely across datasets, the use of color is not consistent, targets often shrink to only a few pixels, and scenes contain very high object densities and objects with partial occlusions. This work presents Aerial-D, a new large-scale referring expression segmentation dataset for aerial imagery, comprising 37,288 images with 1,522,523 referring expressions that cover 259,709 annotated targets, spanning across individual object instances, groups of instances, and semantic regions covering 21 distinct classes that range from vehicles and infrastructure to land coverage types. The dataset was constructed through a fully automatic pipeline that combines systematic rule-based expression generation with a Large Language Model (LLM) enhancement procedure that enriched both the linguistic variety and the focus on visual details within the referring expressions. Filters were additionally used to simulate historic imaging conditions for each scene. We adopted the RSRefSeg architecture, and trained models on Aerial-D together with prior aerial datasets, yielding unified instance and semantic segmentation from text for both modern and historical images. Results show that the combined training achieves competitive performance on contemporary benchmarks, while maintaining strong accuracy under monochrome, sepia, and grainy degradations that appear in archival aerial photography.

However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTD-Attn\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D-Aware Attention Guidance\u548cHierarchical Attention Modulation\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u5148\u9a8c\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "T2I\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u540c\u4e00\u7269\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5916\u89c2\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd3D\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTD-Attn\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff093D-Aware Attention Guidance Module\uff083D-AAG\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2\uff09Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module\uff08HAM\uff09\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u6811\uff08SGT\uff09\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u8c03\u5236\u5bf9\u89c6\u89d2\u654f\u611f\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a3D\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u63d2\u4ef6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TD-Attn\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3T2I\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u5148\u9a8c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf3D\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u76843D\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study of MICo, categorizing it into 7 representative tasks and curate a large-scale collection of high-quality source images and construct diverse MICo prompts. Leveraging powerful proprietary models, we synthesize a rich amount of balanced composite images, followed by human-in-the-loop filtering and refinement, resulting in MICo-150K, a comprehensive dataset for MICo with identity consistency. We further build a Decomposition-and-Recomposition (De&Re) subset, where 11K real-world complex images are decomposed into components and recomposed, enabling both real and synthetic compositions. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we construct MICo-Bench with 100 cases per task and 300 challenging De&Re cases, and further introduce a new metric, Weighted-Ref-VIEScore, specifically tailored for MICo evaluation. Finally, we fine-tune multiple models on MICo-150K and evaluate them on MICo-Bench. The results show that MICo-150K effectively equips models without MICo capability and further enhances those with existing skills.

Current approaches for detecting small objects in aerial images often involve image cropping and modifications to detector network architectures. Techniques such as sliding window cropping and architectural enhancements, including higher-resolution feature maps and attention mechanisms, are commonly employed. Given the growing importance of aerial imagery in various critical and industrial applications, the need for robust frameworks for small object detection becomes imperative. To address this need, we adopted the base SW-YOLO approach to enhance speed and accuracy in small object detection by refining cropping dimensions and overlap in sliding window usage and subsequently enhanced it through architectural modifications. we propose a novel model by modifying the base model architecture, including advanced feature extraction modules in the neck for feature map enhancement, integrating CBAM in the backbone to preserve spatial and channel information, and introducing a new head to boost small object detection accuracy. Finally, we compared our method with SAHI, one of the most powerful frameworks for processing large-scale images, and CZDet, which is also based on image cropping, achieving significant improvements in accuracy. The proposed model achieves significant accuracy gains on the VisDrone2019 dataset, outperforming baseline YOLOv5L detection by a substantial margin.

A Million-Scale Benchmark and New Baseline", "comment": "https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking", "summary": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer wide-ranging applications but also pose significant safety and privacy violation risks in areas like airport and infrastructure inspection, spurring the rapid development of Anti-UAV technologies in recent years. However, current Anti-UAV research primarily focuses on RGB, infrared (IR), or RGB-IR videos captured by fixed ground cameras, with little attention to tracking target UAVs from another moving UAV platform. To fill this gap, we propose a new multi-modal visual tracking task termed UAV-Anti-UAV, which involves a pursuer UAV tracking a target adversarial UAV in the video stream. Compared to existing Anti-UAV tasks, UAV-Anti-UAV is more challenging due to severe dual-dynamic disturbances caused by the rapid motion of both the capturing platform and the target. To advance research in this domain, we construct a million-scale dataset consisting of 1,810 videos, each manually annotated with bounding boxes, a language prompt, and 15 tracking attributes. Furthermore, we propose MambaSTS, a Mamba-based baseline method for UAV-Anti-UAV tracking, which enables integrated spatial-temporal-semantic learning. Specifically, we employ Mamba and Transformer models to learn global semantic and spatial features, respectively, and leverage the state space model's strength in long-sequence modeling to establish video-level long-term context via a temporal token propagation mechanism.

While many recent works seek to enhance CNNs with global contextual understanding via self-attention-based Vision Transformers, these approaches often introduce significant computational overhead. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to retain strong global perception without relying on computationally expensive components. We present GlimmerNet, an ultra-lightweight convolutional network built on the principle of separating receptive field diversity from feature recombination. GlimmerNet introduces Grouped Dilated Depthwise Convolutions(GDBlocks), which partition channels into groups with distinct dilation rates, enabling multi-scale feature extraction at no additional parameter cost. To fuse these features efficiently, we design a novel Aggregator module that recombines cross-group representations using grouped pointwise convolution, significantly lowering parameter overhead. With just 31K parameters and 29% fewer FLOPs than the most recent baseline, GlimmerNet achieves a new state-of-the-art weighted F1-score of 0.966 on the UAV-focused AIDERv2 dataset.

We first define the Hand Interaction Timeline (HIT) from a rigid object's perspective. In a HIT, an object is first static relative to the scene, then is held in hand following contact, where its pose changes. This is usually followed by a firm grip during use, before it is released to be static again w.r.t. to the scene. We model these pose constraints over the HIT, and propose to propagate the object's pose along the HIT enabling superior reconstruction using our proposed Constrained Optimisation and Propagation (COP) framework. Importantly, we focus on timelines with stable grasps - i.e. where the hand is stably holding an object, effectively maintaining constant contact during use. This allows us to efficiently annotate, study, and evaluate object reconstruction in videos without 3D ground truth. We evaluate our proposed task, ROHIT, over two egocentric datasets, HOT3D and in-the-wild EPIC-Kitchens. In HOT3D, we curate 1.2K clips of stable grasps. In EPIC-Kitchens, we annotate 2.4K clips of stable grasps including 390 object instances across 9 categories from videos of daily interactions in 141 environments. Without 3D ground truth, we utilise 2D projection error to assess the reconstruction.

However, multimodal representations often suffer from modality dominance, redundant information coupling, and spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal generalization and limited interpretability. In particular, high-variance modalities tend to overshadow weaker but semantically important signals, while na\u00efve fusion strategies entangle modality-shared and modality-specific factors in an uncontrolled manner. This makes it difficult to understand which modality actually drives a prediction and to maintain robustness when some modalities are noisy or missing. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Residual Semantic Decorrelation Network (DSRSD-Net), a simple yet effective framework that disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared information through residual decomposition and explicit semantic decorrelation constraints. DSRSD-Net introduces: (1) a dual-stream representation learning module that separates intra-modal (private) and inter-modal (shared) latent factors via residual projection; (2) a residual semantic alignment head that maps shared factors from different modalities into a common space using a combination of contrastive and regression-style objectives; and (3) a decorrelation and orthogonality loss that regularizes the covariance structure of the shared space while enforcing orthogonality between shared and private streams, thereby suppressing cross-modal redundancy and preventing feature collapse. Experimental results on two large-scale educational benchmarks demonstrate that DSRSD-Net consistently improves next-step prediction and final outcome prediction over strong single-modality, early-fusion, late-fusion, and co-attention baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDSRSD-Net\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6709\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5197\u4f59\u8026\u5408\u53ca\u865a\u5047\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6d41\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bed\u4e49\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DSRSD-Net\uff09\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u53cc\u6d41\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u6295\u5f71\u5206\u79bb\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u79c1\u6709\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u9690\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5934\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0e\u56de\u5f52\u76ee\u6807\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u56e0\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u7edf\u4e00\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u6b63\u4ea4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u5171\u4eab/\u79c1\u6709\u6d41\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u574d\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6559\u80b2\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cDSRSD-Net\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u65e9\u878d\u5408\u3001\u665a\u878d\u5408\u53ca\u534f\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "DSRSD-Net\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u6d01\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u7b49\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To resolve this conflict, we propose VideoCoF, a novel Chain-of-Frames approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VideoCoF enforces a ``see, reason, then edit\" procedure by compelling the video diffusion model to first predict reasoning tokens (edit-region latents) before generating the target video tokens. This explicit reasoning step removes the need for user-provided masks while achieving precise instruction-to-region alignment and fine-grained video editing. Furthermore, we introduce a RoPE alignment strategy that leverages these reasoning tokens to ensure motion alignment and enable length extrapolation beyond the training duration. We demonstrate that with a minimal data cost of only 50k video pairs, VideoCoF achieves state-of-the-art performance on VideoCoF-Bench, validating the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

Some NVCs incorporate perceptual or adversarial objectives but still suffer from artifacts due to limited generation capacity, whereas others leverage pretrained diffusion models to improve quality at the cost of heavy sampling complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose S2VC, a Single-Step diffusion based Video Codec that integrates a conditional coding framework with an efficient single-step diffusion generator, enabling realistic reconstruction at low bitrates with reduced sampling cost. Recognizing the importance of semantic conditioning in single-step diffusion, we introduce Contextual Semantic Guidance to extract frame-adaptive semantics from buffered features.

Most existing detectors implicitly assume temporally consistent and clean facial sequences, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world scenarios where compression artifacts, occlusions, and adversarial attacks destabilize face detection and often lead to invalid or misdetected faces. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-Regularized Graph Convolutional Network (LR-GCN) that robustly detects DeepFakes from noisy or unordered face sequences, while being trained only on clean facial data. Our method constructs an Order-Free Temporal Graph Embedding (OF-TGE) that organizes frame-wise CNN features into an adaptive sparse graph based on semantic affinities. Unlike traditional methods constrained by strict temporal continuity, OF-TGE captures intrinsic feature consistency across frames, making it resilient to shuffled, missing, or heavily corrupted inputs. We further impose a dual-level sparsity mechanism on both graph structure and node features to suppress the influence of invalid faces. Crucially, we introduce an explicit Graph Laplacian Spectral Prior that acts as a high-pass operator in the graph spectral domain, highlighting structural anomalies and forgery artifacts, which are then consolidated by a low-pass GCN aggregation. This sequential design effectively realizes a task-driven spectral band-pass mechanism that suppresses background information and random noise while preserving manipulation cues. Extensive experiments on FF++, Celeb-DFv2, and DFDC demonstrate that LR-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improved robustness under severe global and local disruptions, including missing faces, occlusions, and adversarially perturbed face detections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLaplacian-Regularized Graph Convolutional Network (LR-GCN)\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u5e8f\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\uff08OF-TGE\uff09\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u8bef\u68c0\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86DeepFake\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DeepFake\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u5931\u771f\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u8138\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u6548\u6216\u9519\u68c0\uff0c\u4f7f\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u96be\u4ee5\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLR-GCN\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u5e8f\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\uff08OF-TGE\uff09\uff0c\u5c06CNN\u5e27\u7279\u5f81\u6309\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u673a\u5236\uff08\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u6291\u5236\u65e0\u6548\u4eba\u8138\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7a81\u51fa\u4f2a\u9020\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u518d\u7ecf\u4f4e\u901aGCN\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e26\u901a\u8c31\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728FF++, Celeb-DFv2\u548cDFDC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u5931\u4eba\u8138\u3001\u906e\u6321\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LR-GCN\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u4eba\u8138\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u8c31\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u65e0\u5e8f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684DeepFake\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To accelerate autoregressive text-to-image generation, we propose Speculative Jacobi Decoding++ (SJD++), a training-free probabilistic parallel decoding algorithm. Unlike traditional next-token prediction, SJD++ performs multi-token prediction in each forward pass, drastically reducing generation steps. Specifically, it integrates the iterative multi-token prediction mechanism from Jacobi decoding, with the probabilistic drafting-and-verification mechanism from speculative sampling. More importantly, for further acceleration, SJD++ reuses high-confidence draft tokens after each verification phase instead of resampling them all. We conduct extensive experiments on several representative autoregressive text-to-image generation models and demonstrate that SJD++ achieves $2\\times$ to $3\\times$ inference latency reduction and $2\\times$ to $7\\times$ step compression, while preserving visual quality with no observable degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5SJD++\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4ee4\u724c\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6b65\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u9700\u6570\u767e\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u6b21\u987a\u5e8f\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpeculative Jacobi Decoding++\uff08SJD++\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Jacobi\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63a8\u6d4b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d77\u8349-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u540e\u91cd\u7528\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8349\u7a3f\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSJD++\u5b9e\u73b02\u00d7\u20133\u00d7\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u548c2\u00d7\u20137\u00d7\u6b65\u6570\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4e14\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "SJD++\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

A major barrier is data heterogeneity. This is particularly true in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, where scanner hardware differences, diverse acquisition protocols, and varying sequence parameters introduce substantial domain shifts that obscure underlying biological signals. Data harmonization methods aim to reduce these instrumental and acquisition variability, but existing approaches remain insufficient. When applied to imaging data, image-based harmonization approaches are often restricted by the need for target images, while existing text-guided methods rely on simplistic labels that fail to capture complex acquisition details or are typically restricted to datasets with limited variability, failing to capture the heterogeneity of real-world clinical environments. To address these limitations, we propose DIST-CLIP (Disentangled Style Transfer with CLIP Guidance), a unified framework for MRI harmonization that flexibly uses either target images or DICOM metadata for guidance. Our framework explicitly disentangles anatomical content from image contrast, with the contrast representations being extracted using pre-trained CLIP encoders. These contrast embeddings are then integrated into the anatomical content via a novel Adaptive Style Transfer module. We trained and evaluated DIST-CLIP on diverse real-world clinical datasets, and showed significant improvements in performance when compared against state-of-the-art methods in both style translation fidelity and anatomical preservation, offering a flexible solution for style transfer and standardizing MRI data.

One prominent issue is vanishing point inconsistency, where projections of parallel lines fail to converge correctly in 2D space. This leads to structurally implausible geometry that degrades spatial realism, especially in architectural scenes. We propose ControlVP, a user-guided framework for correcting vanishing point inconsistencies in generated images. Our approach extends a pre-trained diffusion model by incorporating structural guidance derived from building contours. We also introduce geometric constraints that explicitly encourage alignment between image edges and perspective cues. Our method enhances global geometric consistency while maintaining visual fidelity comparable to the baselines.

To address this critical limitation, we introduce MeshRipple, which expands a mesh outward from an active generation frontier, akin to a ripple on a surface.MeshRipple rests on three key innovations: a frontier-aware BFS tokenization that aligns the generation order with surface topology; an expansive prediction strategy that maintains coherent, connected surface growth; and a sparse-attention global memory that provides an effectively unbounded receptive field to resolve long-range topological dependencies.This integrated design enables MeshRipple to generate meshes with high surface fidelity and topological completeness, outperforming strong recent baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMeshRipple\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u6cbf\u611f\u77e5\u7684BFS\u5206\u8bcd\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5168\u5c40\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7834\u574f\u957f\u7a0b\u51e0\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u957f\u7a0b\u51e0\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u51fa\u73b0\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "MeshRipple\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u524d\u6cbf\u611f\u77e5\u7684BFS\u5206\u8bcd\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u66f2\u9762\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u66f2\u9762\u589e\u957f\uff1b3\uff09\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5168\u5c40\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u4e4e\u65e0\u754c\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u7a0b\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "MeshRipple\u5728\u8868\u9762\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MeshRipple\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce Negative Prompting for Image Correction (NPC), an automated pipeline that improves alignment by identifying and applying negative prompts that suppress unintended content. We begin by analyzing cross-attention patterns to explain why both targeted negatives-those directly tied to the prompt's alignment error-and untargeted negatives-tokens unrelated to the prompt but present in the generated image-can enhance alignment. To discover useful negatives, NPC generates candidate prompts using a verifier-captioner-proposer framework and ranks them with a salient text-space score, enabling effective selection without requiring additional image synthesis. On GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench, NPC outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.571 vs. 0.371 on GenEval++ and the best overall performance on Imagine-Bench.

Action information can be extracted from the body pose and movements, as well as from the background scene. However, the extent to which deep neural networks (DNNs) make use of information about the body and information about the background remains unclear. Since these two sources of information may be correlated within a training dataset, DNNs might learn to rely predominantly on one of them, without taking full advantage of the other. Unlike DNNs, humans have domain-specific brain regions selective for perceiving bodies, and regions selective for perceiving scenes. The present work tests whether humans are thus more effective at extracting information from both body and background, and whether building brain-inspired deep network architectures with separate domain-specific streams for body and scene perception endows them with more human-like performance. We first demonstrate that DNNs trained using the HAA500 dataset perform almost as accurately on versions of the stimuli that show both body and background and on versions of the stimuli from which the body was removed, but are at chance-level for versions of the stimuli from which the background was removed. Conversely, human participants (N=28) can recognize the same set of actions accurately with all three versions of the stimuli, and perform significantly better on stimuli that show only the body than on stimuli that show only the background. Finally, we implement and test a novel architecture patterned after domain specificity in the brain with separate streams to process body and background information. We show that 1) this architecture improves action recognition performance, and 2) its accuracy across different versions of the stimuli follows a pattern that matches more closely the pattern of accuracy observed in human participants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNNs\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8eab\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u8111\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u3001\u5177\u6709\u8eab\u4f53\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u53cc\u901a\u8def\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4f7f\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76DNNs\u662f\u5426\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e24\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709DNN\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4fe1\u606f\u504f\u501a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5728HAA500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u51c6DNN\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u4ec5\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u4ec5\u80cc\u666f\u4e09\u7c7b\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u8868\u73b0\uff1b2\uff09\u5f00\u5c55\u4eba\u7c7b\u88ab\u8bd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N=28\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u8eab\u4f53\u6d41\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u53cc\u901a\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u51c6DNN\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u53bb\u80cc\u666f\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u964d\u81f3\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u8eab\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u53cc\u901a\u8def\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e09\u7c7b\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u8eab\u4f53\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6DNN\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53cc\u901a\u8def\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u7c7b\u4eba\u3002"}}

Demystifying Token Pruning in VLLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) incur high computational costs due to their reliance on hundreds of visual tokens to represent images. While token pruning offers a promising solution for accelerating inference, this paper, however, identifies a key observation: in deeper layers (e.g., beyond the 20th), existing training-free pruning methods perform no better than random pruning. We hypothesize that this degradation is caused by \"vanishing token information\", where visual tokens progressively lose their salience with increasing network depth. To validate this hypothesis, we quantify a token's information content by measuring the change in the model output probabilities upon its removal. Using this proposed metric, our analysis of the information of visual tokens across layers reveals three key findings: (1) As layers deepen, the information of visual tokens gradually becomes uniform and eventually vanishes at an intermediate layer, which we term as \"information horizon\", beyond which the visual tokens become redundant; (2) The position of this horizon is not static; it extends deeper for visually intensive tasks, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), compared to more general tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA); (3) This horizon is also strongly correlated with model capacity, as stronger VLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL) employ deeper visual tokens than weaker models (e.g., LLaVA-1.5). Based on our findings, we show that simple random pruning in deep layers efficiently balances performance and efficiency. Moreover, integrating random pruning consistently enhances existing methods. Using DivPrune with random pruning achieves state-of-the-art results, maintaining 96.9% of Qwen-2.5-VL-7B performance while pruning 50% of visual tokens.

To address this, we propose SAVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement), a framework that mitigates hallucination by steering the model along Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) latent features. A binary object-presence question-answering probe identifies the SAE features most indicative of the model's visual information processing, referred to as visual understanding features. Steering the model along these identified features reinforces grounded visual understanding and effectively reduces hallucination. With its simple design, SAVE outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods on standard benchmarks, achieving a 10\\%p improvement in CHAIR\\_S and consistent gains on POPE and MMHal-Bench. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and layers confirm the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering along visual understanding features suppresses the generation of uncertain object tokens and increases attention to image tokens, mitigating hallucination.

This strategy establishes the model as a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), delivering superior text-rendering capabilities and remarkable photorealism, and significantly enhancing aesthetic quality. 2) Notably, it sets a new industry standard for Chinese character rendering. By supporting even complex and rare characters, it outperforms both major open-source and commercial solutions in coverage, while also achieving superior accuracy. 3) The model achieves remarkable efficiency through its compact design. With a core diffusion model of only 6B parameters, it is significantly smaller than the nearly 20B or larger Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures common in the field. This ensures minimal VRAM usage and rapid inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Beyond generation, LongCat-Image also excels in image editing, achieving SOTA results on standard benchmarks with superior editing consistency compared to other open-source works. 4) To fully empower the community, we have established the most comprehensive open-source ecosystem to date. We are releasing not only multiple model versions for text-to-image and image editing, including checkpoints after mid-training and post-training stages, but also the entire toolchain of training procedure.

The proposed approach incorporates physical priors, an edge detector and a mean curvature term, into a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation, aiming to combine the interpretability and boundary-smoothing advantages of variational partial differential equations (PDEs) with the strong representational ability of deep neural networks. The architecture consists of two collaborative modules: an F module, which conducts efficient frequency domain preprocessing to alleviate poor local minima, and a T module, which ensures accurate and stable local computations, backed by a stability estimate. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves a balanced trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, which yields competitive quantitative results and improved visual quality compared to pure convolutional neural network (CNN) based models, while achieving performance close to that of transformer-based method with reasonable computational expense.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6VM_TUNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\u9879\u6539\u8fdbCahn-Hilliard\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u65ad\u88c2\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5206\u5272\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5176\u53cc\u6a21\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\uff08F\u6a21\u5757\u9891\u57df\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001T\u6a21\u5757\u7a33\u5b9a\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eafCNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u65ad\u88c2\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u5272\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u53d8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f3a\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVM_TUNet\uff1a\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\u9879\u5d4c\u5165\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Cahn-Hilliard\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1F\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u9891\u57df\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff09\u548cT\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5e26\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eafCNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "VM_TUNet\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u517c\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent advancements employ predefined object queries to aggregate semantic information from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) outputs that are lifted into 3D point clouds, facilitating spatial information propagation through inter-query interactions. Nevertheless, perception is an inherently dynamic process, rendering temporal understanding a critical yet overlooked dimension within these prevailing query-based pipelines. Therefore, to further unlock the temporal environmental perception capabilities of embodied agents, our work reconceptualizes online 3D segmentation as an instance tracking problem (AutoSeg3D). Our core strategy involves utilizing object queries for temporal information propagation, where long-term instance association promotes the coherence of features and object identities, while short-term instance update enriches instant observations. Given that viewpoint variations in embodied robotics often lead to partial object visibility across frames, this mechanism aids the model in developing a holistic object understanding beyond incomplete instantaneous views. Furthermore, we introduce spatial consistency learning to mitigate the fragmentation problem inherent in VFMs, yielding more comprehensive instance information for enhancing the efficacy of both long-term and short-term temporal learning. The temporal information exchange and consistency learning facilitated by these sparse object queries not only enhance spatial comprehension but also circumvent the computational burden associated with dense temporal point cloud interactions.

Our explicit 4D representation enforces a single underlying scene that persists across viewpoints and dynamic content, yielding videos that remain consistent even under large non-rigid motion and significant camera movement. We train WorldReel by carefully combining synthetic and real data: synthetic data providing precise 4D supervision (geometry, motion, and camera), while real videos contribute visual diversity and realism. This blend allows WorldReel to generalize to in-the-wild footage while preserving strong geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WorldReel sets a new state-of-the-art for consistent video generation with dynamic scenes and moving cameras, improving metrics of geometric consistency, motion coherence, and reducing view-time artifacts over competing methods.

While most prior work has focused on selecting informative images for classification tasks, we investigate the more challenging setting of dense prediction, where annotations are more costly and time-intensive, especially in medical imaging. Region-level annotation has been shown to be more efficient than image-level annotation for these tasks. However, existing methods for representative annotation region selection suffer from high computational and memory costs, irrelevant region choices, and heavy reliance on uncertainty sampling. We propose decomposition sampling (DECOMP), a new active learning sampling strategy that addresses these limitations. It enhances annotation diversity by decomposing images into class-specific components using pseudo-labels and sampling regions from each class. Class-wise predictive confidence further guides the sampling process, ensuring that difficult classes receive additional annotations. Across ROI classification, 2-D segmentation, and 3-D segmentation, DECOMP consistently surpasses baseline methods by better sampling minority-class regions and boosting performance on these challenging classes.

In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFAE\uff08Feature Auto-Encoder\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u5230\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02FID\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1a\u524d\u8005\u9700\u4f4e\u7ef4\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9002\u914d\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u9700\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFAE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5982DINO\u3001SigLIP\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u4f4e\u7ef4\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u8026\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u6df1\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u91cd\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256\u00d7256\u4e0a\uff0cFAE\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5e26CFG\uff09\u8fbeFID 1.29\uff08800 epoch\uff09\u548c1.70\uff0880 epoch\uff09\uff1b\u65e0CFG\u65f6\u8fbeFID 1.48\uff08800 epoch\uff09\u548c2.08\uff0880 epoch\uff09\uff0c\u5747\u4e3a\u5f53\u65f6\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "FAE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

An apple is like a peach because both are reddish fruit, but the Earth is also like a peach: its crust, mantle, and core correspond to the peach's skin, flesh, and pit. This ability to perceive and recognize relational similarity, is arguable by cognitive scientist to be what distinguishes humans from other species. Yet, all widely used visual similarity metrics today (e.g., LPIPS, CLIP, DINO) focus solely on perceptual attribute similarity and fail to capture the rich, often surprising relational similarities that humans perceive. How can we go beyond the visible content of an image to capture its relational properties? How can we bring images with the same relational logic closer together in representation space? To answer these questions, we first formulate relational image similarity as a measurable problem: two images are relationally similar when their internal relations or functions among visual elements correspond, even if their visual attributes differ. We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance.

Training or even finetuning such models demands vast datasets and computational resources, which are often scarce and costly. Adaptation methods provide a computationally efficient solution to address these limitations by allowing such models to be finetuned on small amounts of data and computing power. This is achieved by appending new trainable modules to frozen backbones with only a fraction of the trainable parameters and fitting only these modules on novel tasks. Recently, the VeRA adapter was shown to excel in parameter-efficient adaptations by utilizing a pair of frozen random low-rank matrices shared across all layers. In this paper, we propose PVeRA, a probabilistic version of the VeRA adapter, which modifies the low-rank matrices of VeRA in a probabilistic manner. This modification naturally allows handling inherent ambiguities in the input and allows for different sampling configurations during training and testing. A comprehensive evaluation was performed on the VTAB-1k benchmark and seven adapters, with PVeRA outperforming VeRA and other adapters.

Data-driven scene generation offers a low-cost alternative by synthesizing complex traffic behaviors from existing driving logs. However, existing models often lack controllability or yield samples that violate physical or social constraints, limiting their usability. We present OMEGA, an optimization-guided, training-free framework that enforces structural consistency and interaction awareness during diffusion-based sampling from a scene generation model. OMEGA re-anchors each reverse diffusion step via constrained optimization, steering the generation towards physically plausible and behaviorally coherent trajectories. Building on this framework, we formulate ego-attacker interactions as a game-theoretic optimization in the distribution space, approximating Nash equilibria to generate realistic, safety-critical adversarial scenarios. Experiments on nuPlan and Waymo show that OMEGA improves generation realism, consistency, and controllability, increasing the ratio of physically and behaviorally valid scenes from 32.35% to 72.27% for free exploration capabilities, and from 11% to 80% for controllability-focused generation. Our approach can also generate $5\\times$ more near-collision frames with a time-to-collision under three seconds while maintaining the overall scene realism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOMEGA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u884c\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u64c5\u957f\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6216\u8fdd\u53cd\u7269\u7406/\u793e\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "OMEGA\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u5411\u91c7\u6837\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u91cd\u951a\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u81ea\u8f66-\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuPlan\u548cWaymo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cOMEGA\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u573a\u666f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ece32.35%\u63d0\u5347\u81f372.27%\uff08\u81ea\u7531\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\uff0c\u4ece11%\u63d0\u5347\u81f380%\uff08\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\uff09\uff1b\u8fd1\u78b0\u649e\u5e27\uff08TTC<3s\uff09\u751f\u6210\u91cf\u63d0\u53475\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OMEGA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

We introduce the EgoCampus dataset, which spans 25 unique outdoor paths over 6 km across a university campus with recordings from more than 80 distinct human pedestrians, resulting in a diverse set of gaze-annotated videos. The system used for collection, Meta's Project Aria glasses, integrates eye tracking, front-facing RGB cameras, inertial sensors, and GPS to provide rich data from the human perspective. Unlike many prior egocentric datasets that focus on indoor tasks or exclude eye gaze information, our work emphasizes visual attention while subjects walk in outdoor campus paths. Using this data, we develop EgoCampusNet, a novel method to predict eye gaze of navigating pedestrians as they move through outdoor environments.

Our Gabor-enhanced segmentation model leverages orientation-aware features with 72 directional kernels to accurately identify and segment cage structures that severely impair the performance of existing methods.

Current 3D avatar generation methods, which rely on large reconstruction models, are fast and capable of producing stable body structures, but they often suffer from artifacts such as blurry textures and stiff, unnatural motion. In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

While DiffusionDrive employs predefined anchors representing different driving intentions to partition the action space and generate diverse trajectories, its reliance on imitation learning lacks sufficient constraints, resulting in a dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality. In this work, we propose DiffusionDriveV2, which leverages reinforcement learning to both constrain low-quality modes and explore for superior trajectories. This significantly enhances the overall output quality while preserving the inherent multimodality of its core Gaussian Mixture Model. First, we use scale-adaptive multiplicative noise, ideal for trajectory planning, to promote broad exploration. Second, we employ intra-anchor GRPO to manage advantage estimation among samples generated from a single anchor, and inter-anchor truncated GRPO to incorporate a global perspective across different anchors, preventing improper advantage comparisons between distinct intentions (e.g., turning vs. going straight), which can lead to further mode collapse. DiffusionDriveV2 achieves 91.2 PDMS on the NAVSIM v1 dataset and 85.5 EPDMS on the NAVSIM v2 dataset in closed-loop evaluation with an aligned ResNet-34 backbone, setting a new record. Further experiments validate that our approach resolves the dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality for truncated diffusion models, achieving the best trade-off.

There exist two approaches: one trains a transformer via an auto-regressive paradigm, and the other adopts a two-stage scheme connecting pre-trained understanding and generative models for alignment fine-tuning. The former demands massive data and computing resources unaffordable for ordinary researchers. Though the latter requires a lower training cost, existing works often suffer from limited task coverage or poor generation quality. Both approaches lack the ability to parse input meta-information (such as task type, image resolution, video duration, etc.) and require manual parameter configuration that is tedious and non-intelligent. In this paper, we propose Unison which adopts the two-stage scheme while preserving the capabilities of the pre-trained models well. With an extremely low training cost, we cover a variety of multimodal understanding tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as diverse generation tasks, such as text-to-visual content generation, editing, controllable generation, and IP-based reference generation. We also equip our model with the ability to automatically parse user intentions, determine the target task type, and accurately extract the meta-information required for the corresponding task. This enables full automation of various multimodal tasks without human intervention. Experiments demonstrate that, under a low-cost setting of only 500k training samples and 50 GPU hours, our model can accurately and automatically identify tasks and extract relevant parameters, and achieve superior performance across a variety of understanding and generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUnison\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u5143\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u8f93\u5165\u5143\u4fe1\u606f\u53ca\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Unison\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u5143\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u957f\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec550\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u548c50 GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Unison\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

By mining and attending to the visible-infrared modality bias, this paper focuses on addressing cross-modality learning from two aspects: bias-mitigated global association and modality-invariant representation learning. Motivated by the camera-aware distance rectification in single-modality re-ID, we propose modality-aware Jaccard distance to mitigate the distance bias caused by modality discrepancy, so that more reliable cross-modality associations can be estimated through global clustering. To further improve cross-modality representation learning, a `split-and-contrast' strategy is designed to obtain modality-specific global prototypes. By explicitly aligning these prototypes under global association guidance, modality-invariant yet ID-discriminative representation learning can be achieved. While conceptually simple, our method obtains state-of-the-art performance on benchmark VI-ReID datasets and outperforms existing methods by a significant margin, validating its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u89c1\u5149-\u7ea2\u5916\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\uff08USVI-ReID\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5Jaccard\u8ddd\u79bb\u7f13\u89e3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u2018\u5206\u5272-\u5bf9\u6bd4\u2019\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e14\u8eab\u4efd\u5224\u522b\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e0e\u7ea2\u5916\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u8054\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u8fdb\u884c\u7c07\u7ea7\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6613\u4f20\u64ad\u5c40\u90e8\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5Jaccard\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ee5\u6821\u6b63\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u2018split-and-contrast\u2019\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u5168\u5c40\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8054\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e14\u8eab\u4efd\u5224\u522b\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6VI-ReID\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5173\u8054\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, \"in-the-wild\" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation.

Yet, existing approaches such as VAEs and foundation model aligned encoders implicitly constrain the latent space without explicitly shaping its distribution, making it unclear which types of distributions are optimal for modeling. We introduce \\textbf{Distribution-Matching VAE} (\\textbf{DMVAE}), which explicitly aligns the encoder's latent distribution with an arbitrary reference distribution via a distribution matching constraint. This generalizes beyond the Gaussian prior of conventional VAEs, enabling alignment with distributions derived from self-supervised features, diffusion noise, or other prior distributions. With DMVAE, we can systematically investigate which latent distributions are more conducive to modeling, and we find that SSL-derived distributions provide an excellent balance between reconstruction fidelity and modeling efficiency, reaching gFID equals 3.2 on ImageNet with only 64 training epochs. Our results suggest that choosing a suitable latent distribution structure (achieved via distribution-level alignment), rather than relying on fixed priors, is key to bridging the gap between easy-to-model latents and high-fidelity image synthesis.

However, existing multi-shot video generation (MSV) methods struggle to effectively model long-range cross-shot context, as they rely on limited temporal windows or single keyframe conditioning, leading to degraded performance under complex narratives. In this work, we propose OneStory, enabling global yet compact cross-shot context modeling for consistent and scalable narrative generation. OneStory reformulates MSV as a next-shot generation task, enabling autoregressive shot synthesis while leveraging pretrained image-to-video (I2V) models for strong visual conditioning.

This dual hierarchy achieves both computational efficiency and representational richness, enabling fast reconstruction of large and complex scenes.

Our approach features two core components: (1) dynamic noising to unify heterogeneous training paradigms, and (2) a modality switcher with an in-context learner that enables unified processing via modular parameters and contextual learning. We contribute a large-scale unified dataset with 1.3M samples. Through joint optimization, UnityVideo accelerates convergence and significantly enhances zero-shot generalization to unseen data.

Existing methods either over-simplify geometry or fail to achieve the pixel-precise, palette-constrained aesthetics of voxel art. We introduce Voxify3D, a differentiable two-stage framework bridging 3D mesh optimization with 2D pixel art supervision. Our core innovation lies in the synergistic integration of three components: (1) orthographic pixel art supervision that eliminates perspective distortion for precise voxel-pixel alignment; (2) patch-based CLIP alignment that preserves semantics across discretization levels; (3) palette-constrained Gumbel-Softmax quantization enabling differentiable optimization over discrete color spaces with controllable palette strategies. This integration addresses fundamental challenges: semantic preservation under extreme discretization, pixel-art aesthetics through volumetric rendering, and end-to-end discrete optimization. Experiments show superior performance (37.12 CLIP-IQA, 77.90\\% user preference) across diverse characters and controllable abstraction (2-8 colors, 20x-50x resolutions).
