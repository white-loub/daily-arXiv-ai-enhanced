TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于TerraMind的地理基础模型在洪水范围制图中的表现，使用FloodsNet多模态数据集对85个全球洪灾事件进行微调和测试，发现结合光学与SAR数据并微调GFM可提升近实时洪水制图能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有洪水制图方法依赖标注数据且泛化能力有限，而新兴的地理基础模型（如TerraMind）虽具潜力，但其在全球不同洪灾事件中的表现尚不明确，需系统评估其适用性。

Method: 采用FloodsNet数据集（包含Sentinel-1 SAR与Sentinel-2光学影像）对TerraMind模型进行微调，测试四种配置（base/large、冻结/非冻结主干），并与基于FloodsNet和Sen1Floods11训练的U-Net模型对比性能。

Result: Base-unfrozen配置在精度、召回率和准确率间取得最佳平衡且计算成本较低；large-unfrozen模型召回率最高；FloodsNet训练的模型召回率优于仅用Sen1Floods11的TerraMind示例，整体准确率相当；U-Net召回率最高但准确率和精度略低。

Conclusion: 融合多模态遥感数据并微调地理基础模型可有效提升全球尺度洪水制图性能，该研究为GFM在气候适应与灾害韧性中的应用提供了实证支持与边界认知。

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

### [2] [Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152)
*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种上下文增强的对比损失函数，通过引入两个收敛目标来缓解对比学习中因数据增强导致的信息失真问题：一是增强类间区分能力，二是拉近同源图像增强样本的特征距离。实验在8个大型基准数据集上验证了其在泛化性能和收敛速度上的优越性，尤其在系统性偏差数据集BiasedMNIST上提升达22.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法易因数据增强引入信息失真，模型过度依赖同标签样本而忽略同源图像的正样本对，尤其在大规模数据集中更为显著。

Method: 提出一种上下文增强的对比损失函数，包含两个组件：1）标签对比敏感组件，强化同类与异类特征区分；2）同源增强一致性组件，拉近同一原始图像的不同增强样本特征，推远其他样本。

Result: 在CIFAR10/100、Caltech-101/256、ImageNet、BiasedMNIST、UTKFace、CelebA共8个基准数据集上，性能优于16种SOTA对比学习方法；在BiasedMNIST上相较原始对比损失提升22.9%。

Conclusion: 所提损失函数能有效缓解对比学习中的信息失真问题，提升模型泛化能力与收敛速度，尤其适用于存在系统性偏差的下游任务，具有更强的公平性与实用性。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

### [3] [SplatSuRe: Selective Super-Resolution for Multi-view Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02172)
*Pranav Asthana,Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Tom Goldstein,Matthias Zwicker,Amitabh Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SplatSuRe方法，通过根据相机姿态与场景几何关系，选择性地在低采样区域添加超分辨率内容，以解决3D高斯泼溅中多视角超分辨率不一致问题，显著提升渲染清晰度与一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）虽能实现高质量新视角合成，但直接对低分辨率输入视图统一应用超分辨率会导致多视角不一致和模糊渲染，现有方法未能差异化处理不同区域的超分需求。

Method: 提出SplatSuRe，利用相机位姿与场景几何关系识别高频信息缺失的欠采样区域，并仅在这些区域选择性注入超分辨率内容，避免全图统一超分带来的不一致性。

Result: 在Tanks & Temples、Deep Blending和Mip-NeRF 360数据集上，SplatSuRe在保真度和感知质量上均超越基线方法，尤其在需高细节的局部前景区域提升最显著。

Conclusion: 选择性超分辨率策略比全局统一超分更有效，SplatSuRe通过几何引导的区域自适应增强，实现了更锐利、更一致的新视角渲染结果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

### [4] [FineGRAIN: Evaluating Failure Modes of Text-to-Image Models with Vision Language Model Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02161)
*Kevin David Hayes,Micah Goldblum,Vikash Sehwag,Gowthami Somepalli,Ashwinee Panda,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估文本到图像模型和视觉语言模型的联合方法，通过检测27种特定失败模式来揭示生成模型在属性保真度和对象表示上的系统性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型常无法准确捕捉提示中的具体属性（如物体数量、颜色），且缺乏分层评估框架；同时，视觉语言模型的基准未能跟上复杂场景标注的需求。

Method: 构建了一个包含5个T2I模型和3个VLM的评测体系，使用LLM标注的挑战性提示与生成图像数据集，测试VLM识别T2I生成图像中27种失败模式的能力。

Result: 发现了T2I模型在属性保真度和对象表示方面的系统性错误，表明当前指标不足以捕捉这些细微错误。

Conclusion: 需要针对性的基准测试来提升生成模型的可靠性与可解释性，所提方法为联合评估T2I和VLM提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

### [5] [Attention-guided reference point shifting for Gaussian-mixture-based partial point set registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02496)
*Mizuki Kikkawa,Tatsuya Yatagawa,Yutaka Ohtake,Hiromasa Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于深度学习和高斯混合模型（GMM）的部分到部分点集配准中特征向量对平移与旋转的不变性问题，指出DeepGMR等方法的理论与实践缺陷，并提出一种注意力驱动的参考点偏移（ARPS）层以提升配准鲁棒性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前基于深度学习与GMM的部分到部分点集配准方法（尤其是DeepGMR）在特征不变性方面的理论与实践局限，理解其失效原因并寻求可解释的改进方案。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的参考点偏移（ARPS）层，利用注意力机制定位两个部分点集的共同参考点（而非重叠区域），从而获得对平移和旋转不变的特征表示，并将其嵌入DeepGMR和UGMMReg中进行验证。

Result: ARPS显著提升了DeepGMR和UGMMReg的配准性能，且改进后的模型优于其他使用注意力块或Transformer提取重叠区域/参考点的前沿深度学习方法。

Conclusion: ARPS通过显式建模公共参考点，增强了GMM-based深度配准方法的几何不变性与鲁棒性，为基于深度学习与GMM的点集配准提供了新思路与更深层理解。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

### [6] [Mapping of Lesion Images to Somatic Mutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02162)
*Rahul Mehta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LLOST的深度潜变量模型，通过病变点云表示和双变分自编码器耦合共享潜空间，从医学影像预测患者体细胞突变谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症治疗效果依赖于早期诊断和干预，而医学影像和基因信息分别在诊断初期和后续治疗选择中起关键作用，因此需要建立二者之间的关联模型。

Method: 引入病变图像的点云表示以实现模态不变性；提出LLOST模型，包含两个由共享潜空间耦合的变分自编码器，并为三个潜空间各自配备条件归一化流先验以适应不同域的数据分布。

Result: 在TCIA医学影像与PCAWG体细胞突变数据上实验表明，模型能有效预测特定突变数量及发生情况，并揭示影像与突变域间反映癌症类型的共享模式。

Conclusion: 该模型为影像到基因预测提供了新范式，未来可扩展至整合其他遗传学数据域，并需进一步提升模型鲁棒性与可解释性。

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

### [7] [WorldMM: Dynamic Multimodal Memory Agent for Long Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02425)
*Woongyeong Yeo,Kangsan Kim,Jaehong Yoon,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了WorldMM，一种用于长视频理解的多模态记忆代理，通过结合文本和视觉记忆，并支持多时间尺度自适应检索，在长视频问答任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频大语言模型在处理长时间视频时受限于上下文容量和细节丢失，且现有记忆增强方法过于依赖文本，缺乏对视觉证据的有效利用，难以灵活捕捉跨不同时间跨度的事件。

Method: 提出WorldMM，包含三种互补记忆：情节记忆（多时间尺度的事实事件）、语义记忆（持续更新的高层概念）和视觉记忆（保留场景细节）；设计自适应检索代理，根据问题动态选择最相关的记忆源和时间粒度进行迭代检索。

Result: 在五个长视频问答基准上显著超越现有方法，平均性能提升8.4%。

Conclusion: WorldMM通过融合多模态、多层次的记忆结构与自适应检索机制，有效提升了长视频复杂场景下的推理能力，为长视频理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

### [8] [Content-Aware Texturing for Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02621)
*Panagiotis Papantonakis,Georgios Kopanas,Fredo Durand,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合纹理映射的高斯点绘（Gaussian Splatting）新方法，通过自适应调整每高斯元的纹理分辨率，在保持高质量渲染的同时显著减少参数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯点绘虽在3D重建与实时渲染中表现优异，但为表达精细外观需大量小高斯元，造成几何与外观频率特性不匹配时的冗余。

Method: 引入每高斯元的自适应纹理图，将纹素大小约束于图像采样频率，并在优化过程中动态缩放纹理分辨率；同时依据纹理分辨率调控高斯元数量。

Result: 在图像质量与总参数量两方面均优于现有带纹理的高斯点绘方法。

Conclusion: 纹理驱动的自适应高斯点绘能更高效地表征外观细节，实现几何与外观的解耦建模与优化。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

### [9] [LumiX: Structured and Coherent Text-to-Intrinsic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02781)
*Xu Han,Biao Zhang,Xiangjun Tang,Xianzhi Li,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumiX是一个结构化扩散框架，用于根据文本提示联合生成多种内在图像（如反照率、辐照度、法线、深度和最终颜色），通过Query-Broadcast Attention和Tensor LoRA实现结构一致性和跨图关系建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在文本到内在图像生成中保证多图之间的结构一致性和物理合理性，需要一种能联合建模多种内在属性的统一框架。

Method: 提出Query-Broadcast Attention机制以在自注意力中共享查询确保各内在图结构一致性；设计Tensor LoRA进行参数高效的跨图关系建模，支持稳定联合扩散训练。

Result: LumiX在对齐度上比SOTA高23%，偏好评分显著提升（0.19 vs. -0.41），并支持文本驱动与图像条件下的内在分解。

Conclusion: LumiX实现了高质量、物理一致的多内在图联合生成，为文本到内在图像生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

### [10] [RobustSurg: Tackling domain generalisation for out-of-distribution surgical scene segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02188)
*Mansoor Ali,Maksim Richards,Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RobustSurg的手术场景分割方法，通过实例归一化和特征协方差映射技术结合恢复模块，提升了在未见分布数据和跨模态情况下的泛化能力，并在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在单中心和单成像模态数据上表现良好，但在未见分布（如其他中心）和不同成像模态下泛化能力差，且现有针对自然场景的方法不适用于视觉线索有限、场景复杂的手术环境。

Method: 利用实例归一化和特征协方差映射分离并利用风格与内容信息，减少外观变化的影响；在ResNet骨干网络中引入恢复模块以保留与任务相关的关键特征；使用新构建的多中心、多类别数据集进行训练以提升泛化性。

Result: 在HeiCholSeg数据集上，相比DeepLabv3+基线平均IoU提升近23%，相比SOTA方法提升10-32%；在EndoUDA息肉数据集上，相比基线提升约22%，相比近期SOTA提升约11%。

Conclusion: 通过解耦风格与内容特征并保留关键语义信息，RobustSurg显著提高了手术场景分割模型在跨中心和跨模态场景下的鲁棒性与泛化性能，为解决OOD问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

### [11] [Spatially-Grounded Document Retrieval via Patch-to-Region Relevance Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02660)
*Agathoklis Georgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合视觉语言模型（如ColPali）与OCR技术的混合架构，用于实现文档检索中细粒度区域级定位，提升RAG任务中的上下文精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs（如ColPali）虽能实现高精度文档页级检索，但无法定位具体区域；OCR系统可提供带坐标的结构化文本，却缺乏语义相关性评估能力。二者互补性未被有效利用，制约了RAG等需精准上下文场景的应用效果。

Method: 将ColPali输出的patch-level相似度分数作为空间相关性滤波器，作用于OCR提取的文本区域；形式化建模ViT patch网格与OCR边界框之间的坐标映射关系；设计交集度量以传播相关性得分；并推导检索精度的理论界。整个方法纯推理阶段完成，无需额外训练。

Result: 实现了无需再训练的、支持区域级定位的文档检索方法；提出了可解释的空间相关性融合机制；建立了理论精度界；开源了实现工具Snappy，并正在进行实证评估。

Conclusion: 该混合范式成功桥接了视觉语义匹配与结构化文本空间定位，为RAG等下游任务提供了更精准、可解释、即插即用的文档检索能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

### [12] [SurfFill: Completion of LiDAR Point Clouds via Gaussian Surfel Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03010)
*Svenja Strobel,Matthias Innmann,Bernhard Egger,Marc Stamminger,Linus Franke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SurfFill的高斯面元（surfel）基础的LiDAR点云补全方法，结合了LiDAR和基于相机的捕捉优势，通过分析LiDAR捕获中的光束发散问题，引入模糊性启发式算法识别缺失区域附近的点，并利用这些点生长出额外的点来完成扫描。该方法在合成和真实场景中均优于先前的重建方法，并扩展了分治策略以应对大规模重建挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR在平坦区域精度高，但容易遗漏细小几何结构，尤其对暗色或吸光材料效果差；而摄影测量虽能捕捉细节，但在无特征区域精度不足。因此需要融合两者优势以提升3D重建质量。

Method: 分析LiDAR光束发散导致的伪影，提出基于点云密度变化的模糊性启发式方法识别潜在缺失区域；使用受限的高斯surfel重建（Huang et al. 2024）专注于优化和稠密化这些模糊区域；从模糊区域提取并采样高斯基元生成新点以补全点云；引入分治策略支持建筑规模的大规模点云补全。

Result: 在合成与真实世界场景的LiDAR点云补全任务中，本方法优于以往的重建方法，有效恢复了细小结构和边缘，提升了整体完整性与精度。

Conclusion: SurfFill通过融合LiDAR与视觉信息，利用高斯surfel模型和模糊性引导的局部稠密化策略，实现了高质量的点云补全，尤其适用于存在细小结构和复杂材质的场景，并可扩展至大规模环境。

Abstract: LiDAR-captured point clouds are often considered the gold standard in active 3D reconstruction. While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.

*Miguel L. Martins,Miguel T. Coimbra,Francesco Renna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种基于多重分形分析的通道注意力机制（Monofractal和Multifractal Recalibration），用于增强卷积神经网络（特别是U-Net）在医学图像分割任务中的性能，克服了现有端到端多重分形方法因过度降维而限制语义分割能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端多重分形方法依赖强池化或特征空间大幅降维，难以适用于语义分割等细粒度任务；同时，多重分形分析在刻画病理性规律方面具有潜力，但尚未被有效融入现代深度学习架构。

Method: 提出两种归纳先验：Monofractal与Multifractal Recalibration，将多重分形谱与概率质量指数关系建模为统计描述，并实现为卷积网络中的通道注意力函数；集成于U-Net框架中。

Result: 在ISIC18、Kvasir-SEG和BUSI三个公开医学影像数据集上，所提方法显著优于其他基于高阶统计量的通道注意力机制；实验还发现跳连结构抑制了注意力响应随编码器深度的特化趋势，其有效性更依赖于实例间全局变异性统计。

Conclusion: 多重分形可作为有效的归纳偏置引入深度学习，尤其适用于需建模复杂尺度不变结构的医学图像分析任务；所提注意力机制兼具理论依据与实际性能优势。

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

### [14] [In-Context Sync-LoRA for Portrait Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03013)
*Sagi Polaczek,Or Patashnik,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Sync-LoRA方法，利用图像到视频扩散模型与基于同步的LoRA微调，实现对人像视频的高质量编辑，同时保持帧级时间同步与身份一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编辑人像视频需兼顾灵活修改（如外观、表情、添加物体）与严格保持原始时序行为（即每帧与源帧精确同步），现有方法难以兼顾编辑质量与时间一致性。

Method: 基于图像到视频扩散模型，以编辑后的首帧为引导，通过在配对同步视频（相同运动轨迹、不同外观）上训练上下文内LoRA实现传播；配对数据由基于同步性的自动筛选流程生成，使模型学会融合源视频运动线索与首帧视觉编辑。

Result: 在紧凑且高度同步的人像数据集上训练后，Sync-LoRA可泛化至未见身份与多种编辑类型（外观修改、物体添加、背景更换等），鲁棒处理姿态与表情变化，展现出高视觉保真度与强时间连贯性。

Conclusion: Sync-LoRA有效解决了人像视频编辑中编辑质量与帧级时间同步之间的权衡问题，为可控、一致的视频编辑提供了新范式。

Abstract: Editing portrait videos is a challenging task that requires flexible yet precise control over a wide range of modifications, such as appearance changes, expression edits, or the addition of objects. The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.

### [15] [Towards Unified Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02224)
*Chen Feng,Tianhao Peng,Fan Zhang,David Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Unified-VQA框架，将通用视频质量评估（VQA）建模为诊断型混合专家（MoE）问题，通过多个感知专家与多代理训练策略，实现跨格式、跨失真类型的统一质量评估，并输出全局质量分与可解释的多维失真向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA方法多为单一模型，缺乏可解释性与诊断能力，且多为格式特化，难以泛化到多样失真和视频格式。

Method: 提出Unified-VQA框架，包含多个专注不同感知域的‘感知专家’，采用多代理专家训练策略（基于排序损失与领域适配代理指标），并集成诊断多任务头以联合输出质量分与多维失真向量，使用弱监督学习优化。

Result: 在17个涵盖HD/UHD/HDR/HFR格式及多种流媒体失真的数据库上，Unified-VQA在通用VQA与诊断失真检测任务中均超越18种基准方法，且无需微调即可保持稳定高性能。

Conclusion: Unified-VQA实现了通用、可解释、可操作的视频质量评估，是迈向实用化VQA的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

*Le Thien Phuc Nguyen,Zhuoran Yu,Samuel Low Yu Hang,Subin An,Jeongik Lee,Yohan Ban,SeungEun Chung,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,JuWan Maeng,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AV-SpeakerBench，一个专注于真实视频中说话人中心音视频推理的3212道多选题基准，强调说话人身份、语义内容与时间点的细粒度对齐，并评估了主流多模态大模型在该任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准难以评估模型对人类语音的细粒度理解能力，尤其在‘谁说、说什么、何时说’三者的跨模态对齐上缺乏严谨测试。

Method: 构建了AV-SpeakerBench基准，包含说话人中心建模、融合感知的问题设计及专家标注保障时序精度与跨模态有效性。

Result: Gemini系列（尤其是Gemini 2.5 Pro）显著优于开源模型；Qwen3-Omni-30B接近Gemini 2.0 Flash，但落后于Gemini 2.5 Pro，主因是音视频融合能力不足而非视觉感知缺陷。

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench为推动多模态系统在细粒度音视频推理方面的发展提供了严格、可靠的评估基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

*Shuang Chen,Tomas Krajnik,Farshad Arvin,Amir Atapour-Abarghouei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络（SNN）的新型图像去雨方法，设计了视觉LIF（VLIF）神经元和脉冲分解增强模块，实现了高效能、低能耗的多尺度特征学习，在五个基准数据集上显著优于现有SNN方法，仅消耗13%的能量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络（SNN）虽具生物可解释性和能效优势，但在低层视觉任务如图像去雨中探索不足，传统脉冲神经元缺乏空间上下文理解能力和易受频率饱和限制，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出视觉LIF（VLIF）神经元以更好表征高通特性，并构建脉冲分解与增强模块（Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module）及轻量级多尺度单元（Spiking Multi-scale Unit），实现分层多尺度表示学习，提升对雨纹等高频成分的建模能力。

Result: 在五个主流去雨数据集上实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的SNN基线方法，同时能耗仅为对比方法的13%，展现出卓越的性能与能效优势。

Conclusion: 本研究推动了SNN在低层视觉中的应用，验证了VLIF神经元与脉冲模块在图像恢复任务中的有效性，为高性能、低功耗的视觉系统部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

*Jeremy Andrew Irvin,Jiaqi Han,Zikui Wang,Abdulaziz Alharbi,Yufei Zhao,Nomin-Erdene Bayarsaikhan,Daniele Visioni,Andrew Y. Ng,Duncan Watson-Parris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF)，一种新型分层流匹配生成模型，用于高效、多尺度、条件驱动的气候模拟；在ClimateBench上优于现有方法，并配合新构建的大规模气候模拟数据集ClimateSuite（含33,000+模拟年、10个气候模型及气候干预情景），验证了其跨模型与场景的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式气候模拟方法依赖天气尺度的自回归建模，存在长时序推演慢、非平稳外强迫下不稳定等问题，亟需更高效、稳定、多尺度的生成范式。

Method: 提出Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows（SPF）：基于时空金字塔结构，分阶段逐步提升空间分辨率并耦合对应时间尺度，支持任意层级的并行直接采样；各阶段均以物理强迫（如温室气体、气溶胶）为条件，实现多尺度气候模拟。

Result: SPF在ClimateBench上于年、月尺度均超越强流匹配基线和预训练模型，采样速度快（尤其粗粒度时间尺度）；结合自建大规模数据集ClimateSuite（33,000+模拟年、10模型、首含气候干预），验证了其跨模型与未见情景的良好泛化性。

Conclusion: SPF与ClimateSuite共同构成了一个准确、高效、概率化、可扩展的多尺度气候模拟新范式，为评估现实未来情景与气候干预策略提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios. Data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/spf .

### [19] [Progressive Image Restoration via Text-Conditioned Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02273)
*Peng Kang,Xijun Wang,Yu Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探索了将文本到视频模型CogVideo用于图像恢复任务，通过微调使其生成从退化到清晰的渐进式恢复轨迹，并在超分辨率、去模糊和低光增强等任务上取得良好效果，且具备零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型在时序生成方面表现优异，但其在图像恢复领域的潜力尚未被充分挖掘。

Method: 对CogVideo模型进行微调，使其生成图像恢复的渐进轨迹而非自然视频运动；构建包含超分辨率、去模糊和低光增强的合成数据集；比较统一文本提示与基于LLaVA和ChatGPT生成的场景特定提示两种策略。

Result: 微调后的模型在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS等感知指标上随帧数提升而改善；在ReLoBlur真实数据集上实现零样本泛化，保持时空一致性与可解释性。

Conclusion: CogVideo可通过适当微调有效用于图像恢复任务，展现出强零样本鲁棒性、时空一致性及可解释的渐进恢复能力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

*Andre Juarez,Luis Salsavilca,Frida Coaquira,Celso Gonzales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MORP--Synth合成增强框架，通过形态学区域扰动与条件生成模型，提升SAR图像油污分割模型从地中海到秘鲁海岸的跨域泛化能力，并在稀缺标注数据下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在SAR油污分割任务中跨区域泛化能力差，尤其在秘鲁海岸因海况、后向散射统计和油膜形态差异大且标注数据稀缺，导致模型性能严重下降。

Method: 提出两阶段合成增强框架MORP--Synth：第一阶段（Stage A）采用曲率引导的形态学区域扰动（Morphological Region Perturbation）生成油污及类油污区域的几何变体；第二阶段（Stage B）利用条件生成INADE模型将编辑后的掩码渲染为SAR样纹理。同时构建了含2112个标注块的秘鲁Sentinel-1数据集，并与地中海CleanSeaNet基准对齐。

Result: 在秘鲁域上，原地中海预训练模型mIoU从67.8%降至51.8%；引入MORP--Synth后，mIoU最高提升+6，油污类IoU提升+10.8，类油污类IoU提升+14.6。

Conclusion: MORP--Synth有效缓解了跨海区SAR油污分割的域偏移问题，尤其在标注稀缺场景下显著提升小样本目标和干扰类的分割精度，验证了合成数据驱动域适应的可行性。

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于预训练视频扩散模型的自监督跟踪方法，利用其去噪过程早期阶段提取运动表征，显著提升了对视觉相似物体的区分与跟踪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督跟踪器在视觉线索模糊时表现不佳，难以区分外观高度相似的物体，限制了其泛化性和可扩展性。

Method: 利用预训练视频扩散模型在高噪声阶段的去噪过程天然分离运动信息的特性，从中提取运动表征用于跟踪，无需任务特定训练。

Result: 在标准基准及新构建的视觉相似物体跟踪测试集上，性能较最新自监督方法提升最高达6个点；可视化验证了该方法在视角变化和形变等挑战下仍能稳健跟踪相同外观物体。

Conclusion: 预训练视频扩散模型蕴含强泛化性的运动表征能力，可被直接用于高性能、免微调的自监督目标跟踪，尤其适用于外观高度相似物体的区分与跟踪。

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

Method: 提出基于薄板样条的对齐框架TALO，利用全局传播的控制点校正空间变化的不一致性，并采用点无关的子图注册设计以增强对噪声几何的鲁棒性，支持多种3D基础模型和相机配置。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集、主干网络和相机设置下均能显著降低轨迹误差，生成更连贯的几何结果。

Conclusion: TALO是一种通用、鲁棒且即插即用的时间对齐框架，有效提升了3D视觉基础模型在时序应用中的性能与稳定性。

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为多权重自匹配类激活映射（MS-CAM）的可视化解释方法，用于提升CNN在SAR图像任务中的可解释性，通过融合通道和元素级权重，更准确地定位目标区域并支持弱监督目标定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在SAR任务中因结构复杂、机制不透明而难以满足高可靠性要求，亟需提升其可解释性。

Method: 提出多权重自匹配类激活映射（MS-CAM），将SAR图像与CNN提取的特征图及对应梯度进行匹配，并融合通道级和元素级权重生成可视化热图。

Result: 在自建SAR目标分类数据集上验证了MS-CAM能更准确突出网络关注区域、捕获细节特征；同时验证其在弱监督目标定位中的可行性，并分析了像素阈值等关键影响因素。

Conclusion: MS-CAM有效提升了CNN在SAR图像分析中的可解释性与定位能力，为高可靠性SAR智能解译提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对统一多模态模型中推理效率低下的新方法：通过训练无关的剪枝分析发现理解组件可压缩性强，而生成组件对压缩敏感；进而提出基于稀疏激活的MoE自适应机制，在保持性能的同时仅激活约一半参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型虽支持理解和生成，但存在推理效率低下问题——不同任务或样本未必需要全部模型容量，且目前缺乏对各组件压缩特性的系统性理解。

Method: 采用训练无关剪枝（深度与宽度维度）分析各组件压缩性；据此提出MoE Adaptation，将生成模块划分为多个专家并实现稀疏激活，并结合专家冻结微调与全参数微调进行验证。

Result: 在BAGEL模型上验证了所提方法：稀疏激活下仅使用约50%参数即达到与全模型相当的性能；代码已开源。

Conclusion: 理解组件具有较高压缩潜力，而生成组件需谨慎压缩；MoE Adaptation通过动态稀疏激活有效平衡了效率与性能，为高效统一多模态建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/Shwai-He/SparseUnifiedModel}{this link}.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种弱监督、无需相机标定的多视角人群计数方法（WSCF-MVCC），仅用图像级人数标签而非密度图监督单视角计数模块，并引入自监督排序损失和语义信息提升视图匹配与整体计数精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无标定多视角人群计数方法仍需昂贵的图像级人群标注；同时，标定方法依赖大量场景级密度标注和相机参数，成本高、实用性差。

Method: 提出弱监督无标定多视角计数框架WSCF-MVCC：1）以图像级总人数为监督信号训练单视角计数模块；2）设计基于多尺度先验的自监督排序损失；3）融合语义信息优化跨视角匹配。

Result: 在三个主流多视角计数数据集上，该方法在弱监督设定下超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: WSCF-MVCC降低了对标注和标定的依赖，提升了实用性与部署可行性，为真实场景中多视角人群计数提供了更高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods. Code is released in https://github.com/zqyq/Weakly-MVCC.

Motivation: 探究不同LiDAR-to-image投影方式如何影响基于视觉基础模型的度量式地点识别性能，尤其关注其在真实自主系统中的鲁棒性与实时性。

Method: 提出一个模块化检索流程，控制主干网络、特征聚合和评估协议等变量，仅改变2D投影方式；在多个数据集和部署场景中，统一使用几何与结构通道进行对比分析。

Result: 识别出决定判别力、环境变化鲁棒性及实时适用性的关键投影特性；实验表明，优化的2D投影可在实际地点识别策略中有效替代端到端3D学习。

Conclusion: LiDAR-to-image投影的设计对视觉基础模型驱动的地点识别至关重要，合理选择或设计投影方式可显著提升性能，无需复杂3D建模。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model. We introduce a modular retrieval pipeline that controls for backbone, aggregation, and evaluation protocol, thereby isolating the influence of the 2-D projection itself. Using consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios, we identify the projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy. Experiments with different datasets, including integration into an operational place recognition policy, validate the practical relevance of these findings and demonstrate that carefully designed projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.

TL;DR: 本文提出VACoT框架，在视觉语言模型（VLM）推理阶段动态调用图像增强操作（如去噪），以提升其在OCR等对抗性场景下的鲁棒性和泛化能力，无需额外训练，显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）严重依赖大规模真实或合成数据，缺乏对视觉数据增强的利用，导致其在基础感知任务上表现不如传统视觉模型；而重新训练VLM成本高昂、增益有限。

Method: 提出Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought（VACoT）框架，在推理阶段通过智能体强化学习动态选择并应用通用图像增强（如去噪、裁剪等），辅以条件奖励机制，鼓励必要且简洁的增强与推理。

Result: 在13个感知基准测试中显著优于基线方法，并在新构建的AdvOCR数据集上验证了后验视觉增强在对抗场景中的泛化优势。

Conclusion: 后验、动态、可学习的视觉增强是提升VLM感知鲁棒性的高效新范式，无需重训练，兼顾效果与效率。

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出BEVDilation，一种以LiDAR为中心的鸟瞰图（BEV）融合框架，通过将图像特征作为隐式引导而非简单拼接，缓解因深度估计误差导致的空间错位，并利用图像先验缓解点云稀疏性和语义局限性；在nuScenes上达到SOTA性能且对深度噪声更鲁棒。

Motivation: LiDAR与相机在几何精度上存在本质差异，盲目融合常导致性能下降，需设计更鲁棒、更有效的跨模态BEV融合策略。

Method: 提出BEVDilation框架：1）以LiDAR特征为主干，图像BEV特征作为隐式引导；2）设计稀疏体素扩张模块（Sparse Voxel Dilation Block），利用图像先验稠密化前景体素；3）引入语义引导的BEV扩张模块（Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block），结合图像语义与长程上下文增强LiDAR特征扩散。

Conclusion: 以LiDAR为中心、图像为辅助引导的融合范式优于传统平等融合方式，能更好兼顾精度、鲁棒性与效率。

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Motivation: 由于传统结核病诊断方法在资源有限地区效率低下，研究探索基于深度学习的替代方案以提高诊断速度和可及性。

Method: 采用Kaggle的4200张胸部X光图像数据集，对ResNet-50和SqueezeNet模型进行训练；数据经过分割、增强和调整大小等预处理，并使用准确率、精确率、召回率和混淆矩阵等指标评估模型性能。

Result: SqueezeNet模型损失为32%，准确率为89%，精确率为98%，召回率为80%，F1分数为87%；ResNet-50模型损失为54%，准确率为73%，精确率为88%，召回率为52%，F1分数为65%。

Conclusion: SqueezeNet在TB检测任务中优于ResNet-50，显示出机器学习在资源匮乏地区辅助早期诊断的潜力，未来需进一步开发更小、更快、更准确的模型以支持全球结核病防控。

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

Motivation: 现有生成式方法对所有空间区域一视同仁，忽视真实场景中不同区域的不确定性差异，导致复杂或模糊区域出现伪影，影响建模的真实性和时序稳定性。

Method: U4D首先利用预训练分割模型估计空间不确定性图以定位语义困难区域；然后分两阶段生成：(1) 不确定性区域建模，高保真重建高熵区域；(2) 不确定性条件下的补全，在结构先验指导下合成其余区域；并引入时空混合（MoST）块在扩散过程中自适应融合时空表征。

Result: 实验表明U4D能生成几何保真度高、时间一致性好的LiDAR序列，在4D世界建模的可靠性上取得进展。

Conclusion: U4D通过显式建模和利用空间不确定性，显著提升了动态3D环境建模的质量与稳定性，为自动驾驶感知与仿真提供了更可靠的4D世界建模基础。

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Conclusion: 所提地图无关、跨时-空-频域建模的轨迹预测方法，有效缓解了冗余信息干扰问题，增强了模型对动态交互关系的建模能力，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠、高效的预测支持。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

Motivation: 现实场景中常因隐私和安全限制无法访问模型参数和结构，传统微调方法受限，需输入级策略增强泛化能力。

Method: SAGE通过风格迁移构建源域多样化风格表征，学习风格特征；再根据输入图像视觉上下文自适应融合风格线索，生成动态视觉提示，隐式对齐跨风格特征分布。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，SAGE在隐私约束下性能优于或媲美现有最优方法，并全面超越全量微调基线。

Conclusion: SAGE是一种有效的输入级域泛化方法，能在不接触模型内部的情况下显著提升冻结模型在未知域上的语义分割性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

Conclusion: On-the-fly Feedback SfM推动了从传统被动式作业向智能自适应探索工作流的转变，为实时地理信息获取提供了新范式。

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow. Code is now available at https://github.com/IRIS-LAB-whu/OntheflySfMFeedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端MOT方法虽检测性能强，但因DETR共享架构导致对象嵌入帧内类别区分强、帧间实例区分弱，难以满足跟踪所需的时空连续性与个体可分性。

Method: 提出FDTA框架，包含：1）空间适配器（SA），引入深度感知线索建模空间连续性；2）时间适配器（TA），聚合历史信息建模时间依赖；3）身份适配器（IA），采用质量感知对比学习增强实例级可分性。

Conclusion: 显式优化对象嵌入的判别性（尤其在时空与身份维度）对提升端到端MOT的关联准确率至关重要，FDTA验证了该思路的有效性与泛化性。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

Conclusion: 精心设计的监督学习足以实现复杂的多模态智能体行为，无需强化学习。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Result: 在SMART-840、VisualPuzzles、EvoChart-QA及新构建的SMART-840++数据集上，WISE相较当前最优MAD方法和聚合策略，准确率稳定提升2–7%。

Conclusion: WISE是一种通用、模块化的多智能体辩论框架，有效提升了多模态视觉-语言推理性能，验证了异构专家协作与加权聚合策略在该领域的可行性与优势。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有墙体分割方法在标准指标下表现良好，但难以检测细长结构、边界不规则，无法满足3D重建所需的几何精度。

Method: 提出MitUNet：采用分层Mix-Transformer编码器捕获全局上下文，U-Net解码器集成scSE注意力模块提升边界恢复能力；引入可调Tversky损失，侧重抑制墙边界假阳性噪声，同时保持对薄墙体的高敏感性。

Conclusion: MitUNet为自动化3D重建流程中的数据预处理提供了鲁棒、高精度的墙体分割工具。

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models. MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

Method: 提出两步GuiDG框架：第一步用提示调优（prompt tuning）为各源域训练参数高效的专家模型；第二步引入跨模态注意力模块，自适应集成多个专家以指导视觉编码器微调；同时构建ImageNet-DG基准用于少样本域泛化评估。

Conclusion: 分域训练参数高效专家模型并自适应融合，可有效提升VLM在下游任务中的域泛化能力，尤其适用于少样本场景。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在GUI导航中具有优势，该研究为构建更强大、泛化性更强的GUI代理提供了实用指导。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI驱动的青光眼检测方法存在可靠性低、参数冗余、易产生虚假相关、难以支持干预分析和临床模拟等问题。

Method: 提出LightHCG模型：基于轻量级卷积变分自编码器构建潜空间表征；采用HSIC进行潜空间解耦以增强因子独立性；利用图自编码器实现无监督因果表征学习，建模视神经区域中青光眼相关物理因素的真实因果关系。

Conclusion: LightHCG通过引入因果表征学习与轻量化设计，为可解释、可靠、可干预的青光眼AI诊断提供了新范式。

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

Motivation: 医疗领域难以获取细粒度标注，且对比学习依赖大批次、高算力，而小数据场景下需更充分挖掘数据与模型知识。

Method: 提出动量自蒸馏（MSD）框架，将动量机制与知识蒸馏结合，并耦合梯度累积以扩大有效批大小而不增加硬件资源消耗。

Result: 在零样本分类中达到SOTA水平；少样本适配AUC-ROC超90%，检索任务提升2–3%；单GPU即可高效训练。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低资源需求的同时提升了多模态模型在医疗小数据场景下的性能与训练效率，推动了轻量、高效的VLM发展。

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/phphuc612/MSD .

Method: BOLT框架分两阶段：离线阶段从多个任务向量中提取每层主导奇异方向并正交化构建可复用基；在线阶段冻结基，仅训练少量对角系数实现低秩更新，并支持无训练初始化（聚合源任务系数）与轻量微调。

Result: BOLT在实验中相比主流参数高效微调（PEFT）方法及典型元学习初始化展现出更鲁棒的性能，验证了任务感知正交子空间约束的有效性。

Conclusion: 将模型适应限制在任务感知的正交子空间中，是一种无需元训练、高效稳定的新任务迁移有效范式。

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) 的新方法，用于增强脉冲神经网络（SNN）对时间信息的建模能力，包含Spiking Encoder（SE）和Attention Gating Module（AGM），并进一步引入Spike-Driven Attention（SDA）降低能耗；在多个目标检测数据集上显著提升性能，同时大幅减少能量消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN通常直接复制输入或以固定间隔帧化处理，导致各时间步刺激高度相似，限制了其在复杂任务（如目标检测）中的表达能力。

Method: 提出TDE框架，包括生成多样化时序刺激的Spiking Encoder（SE）和基于时序依赖引导SE的Attention Gating Module（AGM）；为降低AGM能耗，设计Spike-Driven Attention（SDA）。

Result: TDE可无缝集成到现有SNN检测器中，在PASCAL VOC上达mAP50-95=57.7%，EvDET200K上达47.6%；SDA能耗仅为传统注意力模块的0.240倍。

Conclusion: TDE有效提升了SNN的时间建模能力与检测性能，同时通过SDA显著降低能耗，为高效、高性能SNN目标检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Motivation: 现有3D布局估计模型主要在单层合成数据上训练，无法处理多楼层建筑，且分割楼层会丢失楼梯等跨层结构所需的全局空间上下文。

Method: 构建了面向真实世界多楼层建筑的HouseLayout3D基准；提出无需训练的MultiFloor3D基线方法，利用最新场景理解技术直接处理多楼层布局。

Result: MultiFloor3D在HouseLayout3D基准及先前数据集上均优于现有3D布局估计模型。

Conclusion: 多楼层3D布局估计亟需新方法和真实基准支持，HouseLayout3D和MultiFloor3D为该方向提供了重要基础与启示。

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风格化动作生成模型难以捕捉同一风格下的动作多样性（即 intra-style diversity），包括跨样本的全局差异和单一样本内的时序动态局部差异。

Method: 提出基于聚类的ClusterStyle框架：1）构建全局和局部两个结构化风格嵌入空间，分别对应风格类别间和时序内的多样性；2）使用非可学习原型锚点对齐优化；3）在预训练文本到动作模型中引入Stylistic Modulation Adapter（SMA）融合风格特征。

Result: 在风格化动作生成与动作风格迁移任务上，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 结构化建模风格内多样性（通过原型聚类与双层级嵌入空间）是提升风格化动作生成质量与泛化能力的关键，SMA适配器可有效桥接风格表征与生成主干网络。

Abstract: Existing stylized motion generation models have shown their remarkable ability to understand specific style information from the style motion, and insert it into the content motion. However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer.

Method: 提出STL自训练框架：1）设计结构化推理模板，强制模型先‘看’（提取视觉属性文本），再‘想’（基于属性推理）；2）通过自生成结构化理由进行联合感知与推理优化；3）引入负向理由（解释错误选项原因）以提升判别能力。

Result: 在多个领域实验中，STL持续优于仅用答案或自生成推理训练的基线；定性分析证实其生成理由质量高。

Conclusion: STL是一种低成本、有效提升VLMs多模态推理能力的通用自训练方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

*Fengli Ran,Xiao Pu,Bo Liu,Xiuli Bi,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为轨迹引导数据蒸馏（TGDD）的新方法，通过在模型训练过程中动态对齐特征分布，提升了合成数据的质量和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于分布匹配的数据蒸馏方法忽略了训练过程中特征表示的演化，限制了合成数据的表达能力和下游性能。

Method: TGDD将分布匹配重构为沿模型训练轨迹的动态对齐过程，在每个训练阶段对齐合成数据与原始数据的特征分布，并引入分布约束正则化以减少类别重叠。

Result: 在十个数据集上的实验表明，TGDD实现了最先进的性能，在高分辨率基准上准确率提升了5.0%。

Conclusion: TGDD有效保留了合成数据的语义多样性和代表性，在不增加优化开销的情况下实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了WorldPack，一种具有高效压缩记忆的视频世界模型，通过轨迹打包和记忆检索技术，在较短上下文长度下显著提升了长期生成的空间一致性、保真度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频世界模型在长期时空一致性建模中因长上下文输入导致计算成本过高而难以实现的问题。

Method: 提出WorldPack模型，包含轨迹打包（提升上下文效率）和记忆检索（维持rollout一致性并支持需空间推理的长期生成）两个核心组件。

Result: 在专用于评估长期一致性的Minecraft基准LoopNav上，WorldPack显著优于当前最先进的模型。

Conclusion: WorldPack通过压缩记忆机制有效缓解了长时建模的计算瓶颈，在保持低上下文长度的同时实现了更优的长期生成性能。

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法依赖非商用衍生版本，限制了临床部署；亟需一种商业友好、实时、高保真且能处理形变与遮挡的手术重建方案。

Method: 基于开源GSplat（Apache-2.0）构建端到端可微高斯光栅化流程，集成形变建模、鲁棒遮挡处理，并适配EndoNeRF基准；开发Holoscan SDK应用，部署于NVIDIA IGX Orin/Thor边缘平台。

Conclusion: G-SHARP是首个原生兼容商用生态的手术高斯重建框架，兼具理论严谨性与临床实用性，推动实时术中3D重建走向落地。

Abstract: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue. While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability. G-SHARP overcomes these constraints by being the first surgical pipeline built natively on the GSplat (Apache-2.0) differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, enabling principled deformation modeling, robust occlusion handling, and high-fidelity reconstructions on the EndoNeRF pulling benchmark. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use. Finally, we provide a Holoscan SDK application that deploys G-SHARP on NVIDIA IGX Orin and Thor edge hardware, enabling real-time surgical visualization in practical operating-room settings.

*Qianhan Feng,Zhongzhen Huang,Yakun Zhu,Xiaofan Zhang,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出UCAgents，一种受临床流程启发的分层多智能体框架，通过结构化证据审核实现单向收敛，有效缓解视觉-语言模型在医学诊断中因推理脱离图像证据而导致的可信度问题，在多个医学VQA基准上显著提升准确率并大幅降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在医学诊断中存在推理与图像证据脱节的问题，导致解释虽语言流畅但不可验证；而现有多智能体框架虽模拟多学科会诊，却因开放讨论加剧文本噪声与计算成本，且未能锚定视觉证据。

Method: 提出UCAgents框架：采用分层多智能体架构，强制单向收敛；借鉴临床流程，禁止立场变更，限制交互仅用于目标证据验证；引入单轮问询讨论以识别视觉-文本错配风险；从信息论角度形式化视觉模糊性与文本噪声构成的双重噪声瓶颈。

Result: 在四个医学VQA基准（如PathVQA达71.3%，+6.0% SOTA）上显著提升准确性，同时token消耗降低87.7%；实证表明其能更好提取视觉证据并抑制文本干扰。

Conclusion: UCAgents在保证诊断可靠性的同时大幅提升计算效率，具备面向真实临床部署的实用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出ReVSeg，一种面向推理的视频目标分割方法，通过在预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）上显式分解语义理解、时序证据选择和空间定位三步操作，并利用强化学习优化多步推理链，提升性能与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将复杂的动态、因果与时序交互推理简化为隐式嵌入表示，导致推理过程不透明且难以追踪。

Method: 提出ReVSeg框架，将推理显式分解为语义解释、时序证据选择和空间定位三步操作，并在预训练VLM上执行；引入强化学习优化整个多步推理链。

Result: 在标准视频目标分割基准上达到SOTA性能，并生成可解释的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 显式分解推理步骤并结合强化学习优化，能有效提升视频目标分割的性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为3D-SLIM的新型注意力掩码策略，用于改进大语言模型在3D场景-语言理解任务中的解码器设计，通过几何自适应和指令感知的掩码机制，缓解了传统因果掩码带来的顺序偏差与对象-指令交互受限问题，显著提升了多任务性能，且无需修改模型结构或增加参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的3D场景语言理解方法沿用标准语言建模的因果注意力掩码，导致对无序3D对象引入顺序偏差，且限制对象与指令间的直接注意力交互，阻碍任务特异性推理。

Method: 提出3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask（3D-SLIM），包含两个核心组件：1）Geometry-adaptive Mask——依据3D空间密度而非token顺序约束注意力；2）Instruction-aware Mask——允许对象token直接访问指令上下文；该策略无需架构改动或额外参数。

Result: 在多个3D场景语言理解基准和不同LLM基线上验证了3D-SLIM的有效性，显著提升各项任务性能，证明了解码器设计对3D多模态推理的关键作用。

Conclusion: 3D-SLIM是一种轻量、通用且高效的解码器优化策略，凸显了适配3D空间特性的注意力机制设计对提升LLM多模态推理能力的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Motivation: 现有MLLM越狱攻击过度依赖文本-图像交互，将图像视为次要提示，忽视了图像本身承载复杂上下文信息的潜力。

Method: 提出Contextual Image Attack（CIA），采用多智能体系统，通过四种可视化策略将有害查询嵌入良性图像上下文，并引入上下文元素增强和自动毒性混淆技术提升攻击效果。

Result: 在MMSafetyBench-tiny上，CIA对GPT-4o和Qwen2.5-VL-72B的毒性得分达4.73和4.83，攻击成功率分别为86.31%和91.07%，显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 图像模态本身是攻击先进多模态大模型的有效且强大载体，CIA验证了图像中心化越狱策略的可行性与高效性。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割中的测试时自适应方法在模态覆盖、任务多样性和方法一致性方面评估不足，缺乏统一的基准来衡量其在真实临床场景中的可靠性。

Method: 构建了一个统一数据预处理、骨干网络配置和测试协议的综合性基准MedSeg-TTA，系统评估了20种代表性的TTA方法，在7种成像模态（如MRI、CT、超声等）下覆盖四种主要适应范式：输入级变换、特征级对齐、输出级正则化和先验估计。

Result: 结果显示没有单一范式在所有条件下表现最佳：输入级方法在轻微外观变化下更稳定；特征级和输出级方法在边界相关指标上更具优势；基于先验的方法表现出强模态依赖性；部分方法在大尺度中心间或设备间差异下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: MedSeg-TTA为测试时自适应提供了标准化数据集、验证过的实现代码和公开排行榜，强调应根据具体临床场景进行有原则的方法选择，为开发鲁棒且可靠的医学图像分割TTA方法奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Test time Adaptation is a promising approach for mitigating domain shift in medical image segmentation; however, current evaluations remain limited in terms of modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency. We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation. All source codes and open-source datasets are available at https://github.com/wenjing-gg/MedSeg-TTA.

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

Result: 在需结构化、以对象为中心输出的基准测试中达到新SOTA，在图像描述、视觉定位和多目标检测任务上显著优于自回归模型。

Conclusion: 生成过程与数据内在结构对齐是提升复杂地理空间分析性能的关键。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

Conclusion: 两阶段训练策略及自监督预训练对图像重建任务具有显著增益，更大ViT架构或不同代理任务有望进一步提升性能。

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究零样本异常分类与分割问题，提出了一种基于图的框架CoDeGraph来解决一致异常导致的距离方法偏差问题，并扩展至3D医学影像和跨模态提示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本异常分类与分割在工业检测和医学影像中至关重要，但现有距离法在面对重复出现的相似异常时存在系统性偏差（即一致异常问题）。

Method: 1）形式化一致异常问题并分析ViT特征的统计与几何特性；2）提出CoDeGraph图框架，结合多阶段图构建、社区检测与结构化优化；3）设计无训练、高效的MRI体素分词策略以支持3D零样本检测；4）利用CoDeGraph生成伪掩码监督视觉语言模型。

Result: CoDeGraph有效抑制一致异常影响；实现了真正零样本的3D异常检测与分割；验证了伪掩码可提升提示驱动的跨模态模型性能。

Conclusion: 本文从理论建模到算法设计，系统解决了零样本AC/AS中的关键挑战，为无监督工业质检与医学影像分析提供了可扩展、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Noisy Query Tokens方法，通过端到端优化在视觉语言模型（VLM）与扩散模型之间学习分布式表征空间，并引入带线性投影的VAE分支以恢复图像细节，从而缓解任务泛化崩溃问题，提升持续学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用固定数量可学习查询标记的方法虽计算高效，但存在任务泛化崩溃问题，难以适应远离预训练任务的新任务。

Method: 提出Noisy Query Tokens，实现VLM与扩散模型间的端到端联合优化；引入带线性投影的VAE分支以重建细粒度图像细节。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效缓解了泛化崩溃问题，并在多种任务上实现了稳定的持续学习性能。

Conclusion: Noisy Query Tokens与VAE分支的结合为VLM与扩散模型的高效协同提供了新范式，显著提升了跨任务泛化与持续学习能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

*Xianbing Sun,Zhikai Zhu,Zhengyu Lou,Bo Yang,Jinyang Tang,Liqing Zhang,He Wang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的两步加速方案，通过将早期全局注意力转换为帧内注意力并稀疏化K/V，在保持甚至略微提升精度的同时实现8-10倍的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于全局自注意力的多视角3D模型计算成本高，且缺乏对全局注意力在多视角推理中作用的系统性分析。

Method: 首先分析VGGT和$π^3$中全局注意力的作用，发现其在不同阶段的角色分工；据此提出两步加速策略：1）将早期全局层转为帧注意力；2）通过保留对角线和均值填充的方式对K/V进行子采样。

Result: 在标准姿态和点图基准上验证了方法的有效性，实现了8-10倍的推理速度提升，且精度相当或略有提高，在极密集多视角设置下仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的训练-free加速方案有效减少了冗余计算，揭示了全局注意力在多视角任务中的实际作用，为高效多视角建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行人重识别（ReID）面临高质量大规模训练数据稀缺的问题，主要受限于数据隐私和标注成本；现有行人生成方法在身份一致性和可控性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出OmniPerson统一生成模型，支持RGB/IR模态图像/视频生成、多参考图像输入、姿态与文本控制、RGB-to-IR迁移及超分辨率；设计Multi-Refer Fuser模块以实现鲁棒身份保持；构建首个大规模多参考可控行人生成数据集PersonSyn及其自动化标注流程。

Conclusion: OmniPerson为ReID数据增强提供了高效、可控、身份一致的生成解决方案，并开源代码、预训练模型与PersonSyn数据集，推动领域发展。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

TL;DR: Panel2Patch是一种新的数据管道，用于从生物医学文献中挖掘多层次结构，将多面板、标记丰富的图像和文本转化为多粒度监督信号，提升视觉-语言预训练的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生物医学视觉-语言预训练方法通常将复杂的科学图表压缩为粗粒度的图级配对，丢失了临床医生依赖的细粒度对应关系。

Method: 提出Panel2Patch数据管道，解析科学图表的布局、面板和视觉标记，构建图、面板、图像块三个层级的层次化对齐视觉-语言样本，并设计粒度感知的预训练策略，统一不同粒度的监督目标。

Result: 在仅使用少量文献图表的情况下，Panel2Patch提取出比以往方法更有效的监督信号，在更少预训练数据下实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Panel2Patch通过保留局部语义和多层次对齐，显著提升了生物医学视觉-语言模型的表征能力，为高效利用科学文献提供了新范式。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

Method: 1) 利用扩散模型生成初始手势动作序列，隐式学习音频-动作联合分布；2) 提取音频的低层（如梅尔频谱）和高层（如语义）特征以增强扩散模型训练；3) 设计基于运动相似性的检索算法，在运动图中搜索兼顾全局结构与局部细节的最优路径；4) 对非连续节点路径进行时空对齐与视频级无缝拼接。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，本方法在同步精度（如SyncScore）与自然度（如FID、用户研究评分）指标上均显著优于先前SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型能更有效地建模音频-手势的多对多关系，结合分层音频表征与精细化运动图检索，可生成高质量、高保真度的协同手势视频，为语音驱动动画提供了新范式。

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了RULER-Bench，首个专注于评估视频生成模型规则推理能力的基准，涵盖40项任务、六大规则类别，发现当前SOTA模型在规则一致性上仅达48.87%，揭示其推理能力严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成评测基准聚焦于视觉感知（如美学、时序一致性、指令遵循），但忽视了模型的规则推理能力；已有零样本推理探索缺乏细粒度分解与系统性评估协议。

Method: 构建RULER-Bench基准，基于text-to-video和image-to-video两类范式，设计40个覆盖6类认知规则的任务（共622个高质量标注样本）；采用含4项指标的检查表，并利用GPT-4o自动评分（与人工评分85%一致）。

Result: SOTA视频生成模型在规则一致性（rule coherence）指标上仅得48.87%，显著低于人类水平；各任务表现差异大，暴露模型在逻辑、因果、约束等推理维度上的系统性短板。

Conclusion: 视频生成模型当前推理能力薄弱，RULER-Bench为推动‘推理感知’视频生成与迈向视觉基础智能提供了关键评估工具和改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅关注狭窄子任务，忽视了真实幻灯片制作与编辑中核心的布局理解挑战，亟需一个全面评估多模态大模型在PPT场景下视觉-结构推理能力的基准。

Method: 基于958个PPTX文件构建PPTBench基准，涵盖Detection、Understanding、Modification、Generation四类共4439个样本；通过系统性实验、消融分析与可视化案例研究评估主流MLLMs的布局理解与生成能力。

Result: 当前MLLMs能较好理解幻灯片语义内容，但难以生成空间协调的布局；模型难以融合视觉线索与JSON格式的布局结构，且无法将视觉信息有效融入API规划过程；案例显示普遍存在错位、重叠等系统性布局错误。

Conclusion: PPTBench揭示了视觉-结构推理是当前VLLM的关键短板，为未来研究提供了新视角与明确方向，并开源全部数据与代码以促进可复现研究。

Abstract: PowerPoint presentations combine rich textual content with structured visual layouts, making them a natural testbed for evaluating the multimodal reasoning and layout understanding abilities of modern MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks focus solely on narrow subtasks while overlooking layout-centric challenges, which are central to real-world slide creation and editing. To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频到音频生成方法通常生成混合声音，难以满足多媒体制作中对单个音轨精确编辑的需求。由于视觉特征纠缠及区域线索或提示无法准确指定声源，现有方法在选择性生成方面存在局限。

Method: 提出SelVA模型，将文本提示作为显式选择器来调制视频编码器，以提取与提示相关的视频特征。引入辅助标记抑制无关文本激活，增强跨注意力效果，并采用自增强策略缓解单声道音频监督数据不足的问题。

Result: 在VGG-MONOAUDIO基准上进行实验，结果表明SelVA在音频质量、语义对齐和时序同步方面均表现出色，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: SelVA能够有效实现文本引导的选择性音频生成，为多媒体生产中的精细化音频处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Code and demo are available at https://jnwnlee.github.io/selva-demo/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PolarGuide-GSDR，首个将偏振先验嵌入3D高斯点阵化的框架，实现无需环境图、无强材质假设的高质量反射分离与实时全场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏振NeRF方法训练慢、渲染效率低且依赖材质或视角假设；3DGS虽支持实时渲染，但难以准确重建反射，引入延迟反射模块又依赖环境图。需一种兼顾高效、准确且无需额外假设的反射场景建模方法。

Method: 提出PolarGuide-GSDR，构建偏振与3DGS之间的双向耦合机制：利用3DGS的几何先验消除偏振歧义，再用优化后的偏振信息引导3DGS的法线和球谐表示，实现反射分离与全场景重建。

Result: 在公开和自建数据集上均达到SOTA性能，显著提升镜面反射重建、法线估计和新视角合成质量，同时保持实时渲染能力。

Conclusion: PolarGuide-GSDR首次将偏振先验直接嵌入3DGS优化过程，在复杂反射场景中实现了高保真、可解释且实时的重建，突破了对环境图和材质假设的依赖。

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

Conclusion: UAUTrack为反无人机跟踪提供了高效、统一、可扩展的跨模态解决方案，推动了该领域向实用化迈进。

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

Abstract: One of the deadliest pandemics is now happening in the current world due to COVID-19. This contagious virus is spreading like wildfire around the whole world. To minimize the spreading of this virus, World Health Organization (WHO) has made protocols mandatory for wearing face masks and maintaining 6 feet physical distance. In this paper, we have developed a system that can detect the proper maintenance of that distance and people are properly using masks or not. We have used the customized attention-inceptionv3 model in this system for the identification of those two components. We have used two different datasets along with 10,800 images including both with and without Face Mask images. The training accuracy has been achieved 98% and validation accuracy 99.5%. The system can conduct a precision value of around 98.2% and the frame rate per second (FPS) was 25.0. So, with this system, we can identify high-risk areas with the highest possibility of the virus spreading zone. This may help authorities to take necessary steps to locate those risky areas and alert the local people to ensure proper precautions in no time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为前景感知槽注意力（FASA）的两阶段框架，通过显式分离前景与背景来提升无监督场景分解和对象发现性能，结合伪掩码引导有效抑制过分割，在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有基于槽注意力的方法在处理视觉场景时未区分前景与背景，导致背景干扰严重，实例发现性能不佳，尤其在复杂真实场景中表现受限。

Method: FASA采用两阶段设计：第一阶段通过聚类初始化双槽竞争机制粗略分离前景与背景；第二阶段引入掩码槽注意力，用一个槽表示背景，其余槽竞争表示前景对象，并利用基于自监督特征构建的补丁亲和图生成伪掩码来指导前景槽学习，缓解过分割问题。

Conclusion: 显式区分前景与背景并引入结构化引导信号有助于提升无监督对象表示学习的鲁棒性与准确性，FASA为实现更精确的实例发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: ClimaOoD提供了高质量、多样化的异常训练数据，有效缓解数据稀缺问题，增强模型在开放世界异常检测中的鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

Abstract: Domain adaptation in object detection is critical for real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance. Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes. Our findings establish ALDI++ as an efficient solution for domain-adaptive object detection, setting a new benchmark for performance stability and cross-domain generalization in security X-ray imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了GeoBridge，一种用于跨视角地理定位的基础模型，通过语义锚机制实现多视角（如无人机、街景、卫星）和多模态（如文本与图像）的双向匹配，并构建了首个大规模跨模态多视角对齐数据集GeoLoc。

Motivation: 传统以卫星为中心的跨视角地理定位方法在高分辨率或最新卫星图像不可用时鲁棒性差，且未充分利用多视角与多模态间的互补信息。

Method: 提出GeoBridge基础模型，引入语义锚机制桥接多视角特征；构建大规模多视角-多模态对齐数据集GeoLoc（含5万+样本，覆盖36国）。

Conclusion: GeoBridge突破了传统卫星中心范式，实现了更鲁棒、灵活的跨视角与跨模态地理定位，配套数据集与代码已开源。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The dataset, source code, and pretrained models were released at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoBridge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法忽略标记间的冗余性和空间关系，导致保留过多重复标记或稀疏选择，影响目标区域覆盖。

Method: 提出离心式剪枝范式和空间稀疏缓冲（BSS）准则，结合并行贪婪策略进行高效标记选择，并融合丢弃标记的重要信息到保留标记中。

Result: 在五种VLM上以88.9%剪枝率显著优于强基线，实现端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: VLM-Pruner有效平衡了冗余与空间稀疏性，提升了剪枝效率和模型推理速度，适用于移动端部署。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于性别的全身体MRI图像配准方法，利用VIBESegmentator生成的皮下脂肪和肌肉掩模增强图割配准，在UK Biobank数据上显著提升了配准精度与下游分析（如年龄相关性分析）的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UK Biobank拥有大量全身MR影像及非影像健康数据，需高精度跨被试图像配准以实现体素级关联分析；但现有强度驱动配准方法在解剖结构复杂、个体差异大的全身图像中表现受限。

Method: 提出性别分层的全身体MRI配准方法，将VIBESegmentator生成的皮下脂肪与肌肉掩模融入强度驱动的图割（graph-cut）配准框架；在4000名受试者子集上对比强度仅配准、uniGradICON和MIRTK三种方法；评估指标包括71个组织掩模的Dice分数、体素级标签误差频率，以及年龄与脂肪含量/组织体积的体素级相关性图。

Result: 所提方法在男性/女性中平均Dice分数达0.77/0.75，较强度仅配准提升6个百分点，较uniGradICON和MIRTK分别提升9/8和12/13个百分点；标签误差频率普遍降低；年龄相关性图噪声更小、解剖对齐更优。

Conclusion: 融合双组织掩模的配准方法显著提升了UK Biobank全身体MRI图像的跨被试配准质量，有利于后续精准的体素级医学研究。

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content). We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment. In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

Conclusion: GeoViS有效解决了遥感图像中小目标定位与复杂空间关系理解难题，为多模态模型在地理空间智能任务中的应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: DF-Mamba验证了状态空间模型通过可变形全局建模能力可有效替代传统CNN主干，显著提升遮挡鲁棒性与3D手部姿态估计精度，为相关任务提供了高效新范式。

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

Result: 在真实卫星影像上实验表明，AttMetNet相较最新方法显著降低误报率，提升精确率-召回率平衡性及交并比（IoU）。

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

### [91] [Rethinking Surgical Smoke: A Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Method and Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02780)
*Qifan Liang,Junlin Li,Zhen Han,Xihao Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Bin Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种烟雾类型感知的腹腔镜视频去烟网络（STANet），通过区分扩散烟和环境烟两种烟雾类型，结合烟雾掩码分割与重建子网络，实现更精确的去烟效果，并构建了首个带烟雾类型标注的大规模合成数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去烟方法未考虑不同运动模式导致的烟雾类型差异及其时空特性，导致去烟效果受限。

Method: 设计了烟雾掩码分割子网络（含粗到精解耦模块）进行烟雾类型识别与掩码预测，并结合烟雾类型引导的重建子网络进行去烟；引入注意力加权掩码聚合与跨注意力机制提升解耦精度。

Result: 在合成与真实数据上优于现有最先进方法，且在多个下游手术任务中表现出更强泛化能力。

Conclusion: STANet通过显式建模烟雾类型显著提升了腹腔镜视频去烟性能，为临床视觉引导提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

*Tang Haonan,Chen Yanjun,Jiang Lezhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TrackNetV5，通过Motion Direction Decoupling和Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement模块，显著提升运动小目标在遮挡情况下的跟踪性能，达到新的SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TrackNet系列在处理遮挡和运动方向模糊问题上存在不足，尤其是V4因丢失运动极性导致方向歧义。

Method: 引入MDD模块以保留运动极性，显式编码运动方向；设计基于Transformer的R-STR头，通过时空上下文预测残差来恢复被遮挡目标。

Result: 在TrackNetV2数据集上F1-score达0.9859，准确率0.9733，优于之前版本，仅增加3.7% FLOPs但仍保持实时性。

Conclusion: TrackNetV5有效解决了遮挡与方向歧义问题，在精度和效率之间实现了更好平衡，推动了体育场景中小目标跟踪的发展。

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

Conclusion: 该工作缓解了图像编辑领域数据与评测瓶颈，为模型能力诊断与后续研究提供了可扩展的数据基础、通用评测框架与细粒度分析工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

### [94] [HUD: Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Disambiguation Network for Composed Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02792)
*Zhiwei Chen,Yupeng Hu,Zixu Li,Zhiheng Fu,Haokun Wen,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的分层不确定性感知消歧网络（HUD），用于解决组合视频检索（CVR）中因视频与文本模态信息密度差异导致的指代模糊和细粒度语义关注不足问题，并在CVR与CIR任务上均达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了视频与文本模态间信息密度的差异，导致修改主体指代模糊和细粒度语义聚焦受限，从而影响CVR性能。

Method: 提出HUD框架，包含整体代词消歧、原子级不确定性建模和整体到原子对齐三个模块，利用跨模态整体交互与细粒度对齐来提升多模态查询理解与组合特征学习。

Result: HUD在CVR和CIR任务的三个基准数据集上均达到当前最优性能，并可泛化至CIR任务。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模视频与文本模态的信息密度差异，HUD有效提升了组合检索中的指代消歧能力与细粒度语义建模能力，为多模态组合理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了IC-World框架，利用大视频模型的上下文生成能力并结合强化学习（Group Relative Policy Optimization）与两个新设计的奖励模型，实现多视角输入图像下共享世界建模，显著提升生成视频在场景几何与物体运动上的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频世界模型中多视角输入下共享同一底层世界的建模问题，即共享世界建模（shared world modeling），此前尚未被系统探索。

Method: 提出IC-World框架，通过激活大视频模型的固有上下文生成能力实现多图并行视频生成，并采用强化学习方法Group Relative Policy Optimization及两个新奖励模型（分别约束场景级几何一致性和物体级运动一致性）进行微调。

Result: 在几何一致性和运动一致性两方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: IC-World是首个系统探索基于视频的世界模型中共享世界建模问题的工作，验证了上下文生成与强化学习协同优化在多视角一致生成中的有效性。

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

*Fan Wu,Cheng Chen,Zhoujie Fu,Jiacheng Wei,Yi Xu,Deheng Ye,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PhyCustom框架，通过两种新型正则化损失（等距损失和解耦损失）增强扩散模型对物理概念的定制能力，解决了现有方法缺乏显式物理知识引入的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本到图像定制中虽能较好处理风格、形状等具体概念，但难以准确建模和生成符合物理规律的图像，因其训练过程未显式引入物理知识。

Method: 提出PhyCustom微调框架，包含两个新正则化损失：等距损失用于激活模型学习物理概念，解耦损失用于分离独立概念的混合学习。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，PhyCustom在物理定制任务上定量与定性均优于现有SOTA及主流方法。

Conclusion: 显式引入物理知识并通过正则化机制引导扩散模型学习物理概念是提升物理定制效果的有效途径，PhyCustom为该方向提供了可行框架。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

TL;DR: 本文研究了对抗训练是否无意中增加了对抗样本的可迁移性，发现对抗训练模型产生的扰动比标准模型更具可迁移性，揭示了一个新的生态风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练虽提升了模型鲁棒性，但其对攻击可迁移性的影响尚未被充分探索；作者关注其是否无意中增强了对抗样本在不同模型间的迁移能力。

Method: 训练了包含CNN和ViT在内的36个多样化模型，并进行了全面的可迁移性实验。

Result: 对抗训练（AT）模型生成的扰动比标准模型更具可迁移性，构成新的生态系统风险。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性评估不仅应考察模型对迁移攻击的抵抗能力，还应评估其生成可迁移对抗样本的倾向；作者开源了所有模型、代码与实验脚本以促进复现与后续研究。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出AAG方法，利用单帧RGB与深度特征结合文本或动作识别提供的上下文，实现无需视频时序聚合的动作预测，在多个数据集上达到与先进时序方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类常能仅凭单帧画面结合上下文预测动作，而传统方法依赖视频时序信息聚合；本文探索能否用单帧多模态方法替代视频聚合以实现高效动作预测。

Method: 提出AAG（Action Anticipation at a Glimpse）方法：融合单帧RGB与深度特征增强空间推理，并引入文本摘要（来自VLM）或单帧动作识别结果作为长期上下文。

Result: 在IKEA-ASM、Meccano和Assembly101三个 instructional activity 数据集上，AAG在单帧多模态动作预测任务中性能媲美基于视频时序聚合的基线及当前最优方法。

Conclusion: 视频时序聚合并非动作预测的必要条件；合理利用单帧多模态信息（视觉+深度+语言/动作先验）可实现高效且具竞争力的早期动作预测。

Abstract: Anticipating actions before they occur is a core challenge in action understanding research. While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.

*Vishal Dubey,Pallavi Tyagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了针对印度及南亚面孔的身份保持型AIGC（IP-AIGC）检测问题，发现现有检测器在跨生成器泛化上表现脆弱，尤其在细调后对未见IP-AIGC样本性能显著下降，揭示了其对训练生成器线索的过拟合；研究强调需发展兼顾表征保护与地域适配的检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AIGC检测器在身份保持型编辑（IP-AIGC）场景下的鲁棒性与公平性尚不明确，尤其对印度及南亚等代表性不足人群缺乏系统评估。

Method: 构建面向印度人群的训练集（来自FairFD和HAV-DF），并创建两个基于商业生成器（Gemini、ChatGPT）的IP-AIGC测试集（HIDF-img-ip-genai和HIDF-vid-ip-genai）；在预训练与微调两种模式下评估AIDE和Effort两个SOTA检测器，使用AUC、AP、EER和准确率等指标。

Result: 微调带来域内性能显著提升（如Effort AUC从0.739升至0.944），但一致导致对新IP-AIGC测试集性能大幅下降（如AIDE AUC从0.923降至0.563），而对非IP图像仍保持高精度，表明模型对IP编辑特异性脆弱。

Conclusion: IP-AIGC-Indian是一个具有挑战性且实际重要的新基准场景；现有方法存在严重跨生成器泛化缺陷，亟需引入表征保护的自适应策略和本土化基准建设。

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels. All data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/ricoleehduu/STS-Challenge-2025 to ensure reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型多依赖监督微调（SFT），而在线强化学习（RL）后训练在相机控制视频生成中尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出基于3D相机轨迹估计与分段相对姿态比对的可验证几何奖励函数，并结合在线RL进行后训练；同时构建涵盖大振幅相机运动与多样主体动态的专用数据集。

Result: 在线RL后训练在相机控制精度、几何一致性与视觉质量上均明显优于SFT基线方法。

Conclusion: 在线强化学习是提升相机控制视频生成性能的有效新范式，尤其在缓解奖励稀疏性与提高优化效率方面具有优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Abstract: We present MindGPT-4ov, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that introduces a general post-training paradigm spanning data production, model training, and efficient deployment. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment. MindGPT-4ov provides a general post-training paradigm applicable to a wide range of MLLMs. The model weights, datasets, and code for the Qwen3-VL-based variants will be recently open-sourced to support the community's development of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于LoRA适配器的相位感知加速策略，通过Slow-LoRA和Fast-LoRA在不同去噪阶段实现差异化加速，在极低训练成本下实现高达5倍的推理加速，同时保持良好的生成质量与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理步数多、计算开销大，现有少步蒸馏方法存在重训练成本高和泛化性差的问题，需寻找更高效且通用的加速方案。

Method: 提出相位感知加速策略，将去噪过程分为语义关键的早期阶段和冗余的后期阶段，分别用Slow-LoRA（慢速）和Fast-LoRA（快速）适配器进行差异化加速，仅微调轻量级LoRA模块而非重新训练整个学生模型。

Conclusion: 相位感知的LoRA适配器策略是一种高效、低成本且泛化的扩散模型加速方法，无需复杂蒸馏即可实现出色的推理加速与性能平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

Conclusion: MRD通过多分辨率融合与全局检测策略，有效解决了分块处理带来的语义碎片问题，提升了高分辨率图像的理解精度。

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Method: 提出DiverseAR：1）自适应logits分布缩放机制，动态调整二元输出分布的尖锐度；2）基于能量的生成路径搜索算法，避免采样低置信度token以维持图像保真度。

Result: 大量实验表明DiverseAR显著提升了比特级自回归图像生成的样本多样性，且未牺牲视觉质量。

Conclusion: DiverseAR是一种原理清晰、效果显著的方法，可在不损害视觉质量的前提下有效提升比特级AR模型的生成多样性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Motivation: 3D高斯点绘（3DGS）虽能实现实时高保真渲染，但存在多视角几何不一致问题；而2D高斯点绘（2DGS）虽保证多视角一致性，却牺牲纹理细节。本文旨在兼顾两者优势。

Method: 提出EGGS混合表示框架，包含三部分：1）混合高斯光栅化实现统一渲染；2）自适应类型交换机制动态切换2D/3D高斯；3）频域解耦优化策略分别发挥两类高斯的优势，并采用CUDA加速实现高效训练与推理。

Result: 在多个基准上，EGGS在渲染质量、几何精度和运行效率方面均优于现有方法，实现了高质量新型视图合成。

Conclusion: EGGS成功平衡了外观保真度与几何一致性，为实用化高质量新型视图合成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

Abstract: Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.

Abstract: The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

Abstract: We present Layout Anything, a transformer-based framework for indoor layout estimation that adapts the OneFormer's universal segmentation architecture to geometric structure prediction. Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets. The framework's combination of geometric awareness and computational efficiency makes it particularly suitable for augmented reality applications and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: In low-light environments like nighttime driving, image degradation severely challenges in-vehicle camera safety. Since existing enhancement algorithms are often too computationally intensive for vehicular applications, we propose UltraFast-LieNET, a lightweight multi-scale shifted convolutional network for real-time low-light image enhancement. We introduce a Dynamic Shifted Convolution (DSConv) kernel with only 12 learnable parameters for efficient feature extraction. By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field. To mitigate lightweight network instability, a residual structure and a novel multi-level gradient-aware loss function are incorporated. UltraFast-LieNET allows flexible parameter configuration, with a minimum size of only 36 parameters. Results on the LOLI-Street dataset show a PSNR of 26.51 dB, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.6 dB while utilizing only 180 parameters. Experiments across four benchmark datasets validate its superior balance of real-time performance and enhancement quality under limited resources.

Conclusion: InEx是一种高效、无需训练的多智能体幻觉缓解方案，为构建更可靠的多模态大语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D object detection, point clouds remain challenging due to sparse data, incomplete structures, and limited semantic information. Capturing contextual relationships between distant objects presents additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose GraphFusion3D, a unified framework combining multi-modal fusion with advanced feature learning. Our approach introduces the Adaptive Cross-Modal Transformer (ACMT), which adaptively integrates image features into point representations to enrich both geometric and semantic information. For proposal refinement, we introduce the Graph Reasoning Module (GRM), a novel mechanism that models neighborhood relationships to simultaneously capture local geometric structures and global semantic context. The module employs multi-scale graph attention to dynamically weight both spatial proximity and feature similarity between proposals. We further employ a cascade decoder that progressively refines detections through multi-stage predictions. Extensive experiments on SUN RGB-D (70.6\% AP$_{25}$ and 51.2\% AP$_{50}$) and ScanNetV2 (75.1\% AP$_{25}$ and 60.8\% AP$_{50}$) demonstrate a substantial performance improvement over existing approaches.

Conclusion: TEXTRIX overcomes limitations of multi-view fusion by enabling native 3D attribute generation, offering a unified, effective solution for texture synthesis and semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Prevailing 3D texture generation methods, which often rely on multi-view fusion, are frequently hindered by inter-view inconsistencies and incomplete coverage of complex surfaces, limiting the fidelity and completeness of the generated content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TEXTRIX, a native 3D attribute generation framework for high-fidelity texture synthesis and downstream applications such as precise 3D part segmentation. Our approach constructs a latent 3D attribute grid and leverages a Diffusion Transformer equipped with sparse attention, enabling direct coloring of 3D models in volumetric space and fundamentally avoiding the limitations of multi-view fusion.

Conclusion: DynamicVerse显著提升了从互联网单目视频中建模真实世界动态的能力，为具身智能体提供了更准确、更丰富的4D环境理解支持。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic physical world, characterized by its evolving 3D structure, real-world motion, and semantic content with textual descriptions, is crucial for human-agent interaction and enables embodied agents to perceive and act within real environments with human-like capabilities. However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.

Result: 在Waymo、nuScenes、Argoverse2等大规模驾驶基准上，DGGT在单数据集训练和跨数据集零样本迁移下均超越先前方法；推理为单次前馈，速度快、可扩展性强（随输入帧数增加仍保持良好扩展性）；显著提升稀疏视角下的新视角合成质量。

Conclusion: DGGT首次实现了真正意义上的位姿无关、前馈式、可扩展4D动态驾驶场景重建，为自动驾驶仿真与评估提供了高效、鲁棒的新范式。

Abstract: Autonomous driving needs fast, scalable 4D reconstruction and re-simulation for training and evaluation, yet most methods for dynamic driving scenes still rely on per-scene optimization, known camera calibration, or short frame windows, making them slow and impractical. We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed. Trained and evaluated on large-scale driving benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse2), our method outperforms prior work both when trained on each dataset and in zero-shot transfer across datasets, and it scales well as the number of input frames increases.

*Mengchen Zhang,Qi Chen,Tong Wu,Zihan Liu,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了端到端的双耳空间音频生成任务，直接从无声视频生成具有空间沉浸感的双耳音频，并发布了包含约97K个视频-双耳音频对的BiAudio数据集。作者还提出了ViSAudio框架，采用基于条件流匹配和双分支生成结构的方法，在时空一致性与空间特征保持之间实现平衡，实验表明其在客观指标和主观评价上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法主要集中于单声道输出，缺乏空间沉浸感；而现有的双耳音频生成多采用两阶段方法（先生成单声道再空间化），易导致误差累积和时空不一致问题。因此需要一种端到端的双耳音频生成方法以提升空间感知与同步性。

Method: 提出ViSAudio框架，采用条件流匹配（conditional flow matching）与双分支音频生成架构，两个分支分别建模左右耳音频潜在流，并引入条件时空模块来协调通道间一致性并保留空间特性，实现音频与视频在时空上的精准对齐。

Result: 在客观指标和主观评测中均优于现有最先进方法，能够生成高质量、具空间沉浸感的双耳音频，有效适应视角变化、声源运动和不同声学环境。

Conclusion: 本文首次提出端到端的视频到双耳音频生成任务，通过构建大规模BiAudio数据集和设计ViSAudio框架，显著提升了生成音频的空间真实感与时空一致性，为未来视听生成研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite progress in video-to-audio generation, the field focuses predominantly on mono output, lacking spatial immersion. Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的稳定性适配器方法，用于提升帧级网络在视频处理中的时间稳定性与对时变图像退化（如噪声、压缩伪影、恶劣天气）的鲁棒性，无需微调主干网络，且在多个视觉任务上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帧级网络在视频序列中易出现时间不一致（如输出闪烁），尤其在输入含时变退化时更严重，亟需一种轻量、通用、可插拔的稳定性增强方案。

Method: 提出一类可插入任意架构的稳定性适配器，设计统一的准确性-稳定性-鲁棒性联合损失函数，并基于其理论性质指导稳定器训练；采用冻结主干网络、资源高效的方式进行训练。

Result: 在NAFNet（去噪）、HDRNet（增强）、Depth Anything v2（单目深度）、DeepLabv3+（语义分割）等多个任务上显著提升了时间稳定性与对多种图像退化（压缩、噪声、恶劣天气）的鲁棒性，同时保持或提升预测质量。

Conclusion: 所提稳定性适配器是一种通用、即插即用、训练高效的视频推理增强方法，为帧级模型向稳定鲁棒视频应用迁移提供了实用可行的路径。

Abstract: When applied sequentially to video, frame-based networks often exhibit temporal inconsistency - for example, outputs that flicker between frames. This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视频生成模型是否能仅通过视觉数据展现人类认知核心能力——视觉空间智能。

Method: 提出Video4Spatial框架，基于纯视频输入（无深度、位姿等辅助模态）训练视频扩散模型，完成场景导航（遵循相机位姿指令并保持3D几何一致性）和物体定位（语义定位、指令跟随与规划）两项空间任务。

Result: Video4Spatial在两项任务中均表现出强空间理解能力：端到端规划导航路径、准确定位目标物体、遵循相机指令并维持空间一致性，并具备长上下文建模与跨域环境泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作推动视频生成模型向通用视觉空间推理能力迈进，表明纯视频数据足以支撑复杂空间智能。

Abstract: We investigate whether video generative models can exhibit visuospatial intelligence, a capability central to human cognition, using only visual data. To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AutoBrep，一种基于Transformer的自回归模型，用于高质量、拓扑封闭的边界表示（B-Rep）生成，通过统一的几何-拓扑离散化编码与广度优先序列建模实现端到端B-Rep生成，并支持自动补全与用户可控CAD建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有进展，但端到端生成具有精确几何和封闭拓扑的B-Rep仍具挑战性；现有方法难以兼顾质量、有效性与可扩展性。

Method: 提出AutoBrep模型：采用统一tokenization方案，将几何原语（曲面/曲线）编码为latent geometry tokens，结构关系编码为topological reference tokens；序列顺序遵循B-Rep面邻接图的广度优先遍历；推理时逐步生成邻接面、边及其拓扑结构。

Result: AutoBrep在生成质量、watertightness、复杂模型扩展性、保真度及推理速度上均优于基线方法；天然支持B-Rep自动补全，实现用户可控CAD生成。

Conclusion: AutoBrep验证了统一几何-拓扑序列建模与自回归生成范式在B-Rep生成任务中的有效性与实用性，为AI驱动的CAD建模提供了新路径。

Abstract: The boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard data structure used in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for defining solid models. Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes. Code is available at https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/AutoBrep.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PPTArena基准测试和PPTPilot编辑代理，旨在提升PowerPoint幻灯片在自然语言指令下的可靠编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多基于图像-PDF渲染或文本生成幻灯片，缺乏对真实PPT文件的原位、结构化编辑能力评估，尤其难以保证跨幻灯片、布局敏感及长周期编辑的可靠性。

Method: 构建了包含100个演示文稿、2125张幻灯片、800+目标编辑任务的PPTArena基准；设计了双VLM裁判流水线进行指令遵循与视觉质量评估；提出结构感知的PPTPilot代理，结合语义编辑规划、程序化工具与XML底层操作，并通过‘计划-编辑-校验’循环迭代验证。

Result: PPTPilot在复合编辑、布局敏感编辑和跨幻灯片编辑上较前沿专有代理和VLM系统提升超10个百分点，视觉保真度与整套文档一致性显著增强。

Conclusion: PPTArena揭示了当前智能代理在长周期、文档级PPT编辑任务中仍存在明显不足，亟需更鲁棒的结构理解与执行机制。

Abstract: We introduce PPTArena, a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that measures reliable modifications to real slides under natural-language instructions. In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.

TL;DR: 本文提出Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT)方法，将MRI重建中的展开网络与条件概率流常微分方程（ODE）建立理论联系，并据此设计参数更新和中间状态对齐策略，显著提升重建稳定性与收敛速度，同时降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI加速重建方法中，展开网络虽高效但因自由学习的中间参数导致演化不稳定；扩散模型虽理论稳定但计算昂贵。亟需兼顾稳定性、效率与重建质量的新方法。

Method: 理论证明展开网络是条件概率流ODE的离散实现，据此提出Flow-Aligned Training（FLAT），通过ODE离散化导出网络参数，并强制中间重建结果对齐理想ODE轨迹。

Result: 在三个MRI数据集上，FLAT相比扩散模型减少最多3倍迭代次数，且比传统展开网络更稳定、收敛更快、重建质量更高。

Conclusion: 将展开网络置于概率流ODE框架下可兼顾理论稳定性与实际效率，FLAT为加速MRI重建提供了一种兼具可解释性、稳定性与高性能的新范式。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers excellent soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation, but its long acquisition time limits clinical utility. Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.

Abstract: We propose MAViD, a novel Multimodal framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue understanding and generation. Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.

Abstract: Current video generation techniques excel at single-shot clips but struggle to produce narrative multi-shot videos, which require flexible shot arrangement, coherent narrative, and controllability beyond text prompts. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in eliciting visual reasoning within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist. All code, model, and data are released.

Motivation: 尽管多视角扩散模型在新视角合成方面表现出色，但其保持视图一致性的内在机制尚不明确，尤其在大视角变化下几何对应性退化严重。

Method: 作者分析了注意力图在训练过程中获取几何对应的能力，并引入CAMEO方法，通过对单个注意力层施加几何对应的直接监督来增强模型学习精确对应关系的能力。

Conclusion: CAMEO是一种简单而有效的方法，能够显著提升多视角扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，同时具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet the underlying mechanism that enables their view-consistency remains unclear. In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型使用单一整体提示，难以解耦用户对内容、位置和外观等不同方面的意图，导致控制粒度不足。

Method: 将创意意图分解为内容层、空间层、结构层和色彩层；设计上下文感知的内容集成数据生成流程、统一视觉线索处理控制模块，以及用于精确局部编辑（包括对象移除）的微调空间分支。

Conclusion: MagicQuill V2 成功融合了扩散模型的语义生成能力与传统图形工具的细粒度控制，为生成式图像编辑提供了更可控、更符合用户意图的新范式。

Abstract: We propose MagicQuill V2, a novel system that introduces a \textbf{layered composition} paradigm to generative image editing, bridging the gap between the semantic power of diffusion models and the granular control of traditional graphics software. While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.

Motivation: 为系统、细粒度地评估大语言模型在临床处方审核中的能力，需构建一个权威、全面且由专业药师验证的基准测试集。

Method: 构建了RxBench基准，包含1150道单选、230道多选和879道简答题，全部由资深临床药师审核；对18个前沿大语言模型进行评测，并对一个中等性能模型开展针对性微调。

Conclusion: RxBench建立了首个以错误类型为导向、标准化的处方审核评估框架，揭示了当前LLM的能力边界，并为开发更可靠、专业的临床AI工具提供了基础支撑。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their integration into clinical decision support, particularly in prescription review. To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text generators into powerful problem solvers. Yet, many open tasks demand critical thinking, multi-source, and verifiable outputs, which are beyond single-shot prompting or standard retrieval-augmented generation. Recently, numerous studies have explored Deep Research (DR), which aims to combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external tools, such as search engines, thereby empowering LLMs to act as research agents capable of completing complex, open-ended tasks. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of deep research systems, including a clear roadmap, foundational components, practical implementation techniques, important challenges, and future directions. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows: (i) we formalize a three-stage roadmap and distinguish deep research from related paradigms; (ii) we introduce four key components: query planning, information acquisition, memory management, and answer generation, each paired with fine-grained sub-taxonomies; (iii) we summarize optimization techniques, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning; and (iv) we consolidate evaluation criteria and open challenges, aiming to guide and facilitate future development. As the field of deep research continues to evolve rapidly, we are committed to continuously updating this survey to reflect the latest progress in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become one of the most transformative tools across many applications, as they have significantly boosted productivity and achieved impressive results in various domains such as finance, healthcare, education, telecommunications, and law, among others. Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension. Finally, we propose a Model Selection Methodology (MSM), a systematic approach designed to guide the navigation, prioritization, and selection of the model that best aligns with a given use case.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Coherent Contextual Decoding（CCD）的新推理框架，通过轨迹校正机制和自适应采样策略，提升扩散语言模型（DLMs）生成质量与推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DLMs推理方法依赖局部即时指标（如置信度、熵），缺乏对整体生成轨迹一致性的可靠评估，导致采样不稳定、生成质量欠佳。

Method: 提出CCD框架：1）轨迹校正机制，利用历史上下文增强序列连贯性，并基于条件互信息建模历史一致性；2）自适应采样策略，依据一致性指标动态分配每步的unmasking预算，替代固定步数预算。

Result: 在Dream和LLaDA多个基准上实现推理速度最高提升3.48倍、性能提升3.91%，同时提升生成轨迹质量与采样效率。

Conclusion: CCD通过引入历史一致性建模与动态预算分配，有效克服了DLMs传统推理中局部性与低效性问题，为高质量、高效率扩散语言生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型（LLMs）训练昂贵、耗时且内存占用高的问题，尤其是微调阶段对显存的高需求。

Method: 设计基于对称与辛微分方程的可逆网络架构，避免存储中间激活值；提出将现有非可逆LLM通过微调转换为可逆架构的方法。

Result: 在多个数据集和基准上，可逆LLM实现了与基线模型相当甚至更优的性能，同时大幅降低内存占用、提升批处理规模与训练吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该方法为降低LLM从头训练和微调的内存与计算开销提供了可扩展、实用的新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

Motivation: 方言识别（DI）对提升下游语音任务性能很重要，但传统微调计算和内存开销大；现有参数高效微调（PEFT）虽节省参数，但在内存效率和训练速度上提升有限。

Method: 将面向自然语言处理提出的内存高效微调（MEFT）方法迁移至通用预训练语音模型（如Whisper），并在KeSpeech数据集上针对六种汉语方言进行实验验证，系统评估不同MEFT方法的GPU内存占用与训练速度。

Result: 在KeSpeech数据集上微调Whisper模型识别六种汉语方言，GPU内存使用最多降低73.25%，训练速度提升2.1倍，准确率与全参数微调及PEFT方法相当。

Conclusion: MEFT方法可有效提升语音模型微调的内存效率与训练速度，为资源受限场景下的方言识别等语音任务提供了可行且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dialect Identification (DI) is a task to recognize different dialects within the same language from a speech signal. DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出RESP框架，通过自生成校准、解码时梯度重要性估计和渐进式再生，解决现有剪枝方法在推理大模型（RLMs）上导致性能崩溃的问题，在Qwen3-8B上显著提升剪枝后的数学推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法在推理大模型（RLMs）上效果差，即使20%稀疏度也会严重损害准确率和推理连贯性，主因是校准数据、剪枝目标与模型解码时推理行为不匹配。

Method: 提出RESP：基于模型自生成推理轨迹进行校准；采用仅解码阶段的梯度估计参数重要性；引入渐进式再生机制以维持高稀疏度下的校准保真度。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上，20–30%稀疏度下接近稠密模型精度；40%稀疏度时GSM8K达81.3%，MathQA达59.6%，分别超越最强基线66.87%和47%。

Conclusion: RESP首次将剪枝与RLM的动态推理行为对齐，显著缓解性能崩溃，为轻量化部署高性能推理模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs (RLMs) such as OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3 deliver strong multi-step reasoning through chain-of-thought generation, but their large model sizes and lengthy decode-time outputs make them costly to deploy and unsuitable for resource-constrained settings. To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.

Abstract: This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

Abstract: Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

Motivation: 传统基于强化学习的潜推理方法计算开销大，尤其在叙事类任务中需处理大量token，亟需更高效的推理机制。

Method: 提出LiteReason方法，包含一个轻量级的Reasoning Projector模块，用于生成连续潜token以跳过部分推理步骤；在RL训练中由策略模型动态决定何时启用该模块，实现潜推理与离散token采样的灵活交替。

Result: 在情节漏洞检测和书籍章节生成任务上，LiteReason优于现有潜推理基线，性能接近非潜式RL训练，同时将最终推理长度减少77-92%。

Conclusion: LiteReason有效引导RL训练进入性能与计算成本更优的权衡区域，为复杂任务下的高效推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.

### [143] [CAIRNS: Balancing Readability and Scientific Accuracy in Climate Adaptation Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02251)
*Liangji Kong,Aditya Joshi,Sarvnaz Karimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出CAIRNS框架，用于提升农业气候适应策略问答的可读性与可信度，无需微调或强化学习即可实现专家级、可验证的领域问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业中气候适应策略信息分散于非结构化文献和结构化政府数据中，现有工具难以兼顾可读性、溯源性和领域适配性。

Method: 提出CAIRNS框架，包含结构化ScholarGuide提示以增强可读性与引用可靠性，以及一致性加权混合评估器，利用多模型间共识与专家判断进行鲁棒评估。

Result: 在专家标注数据集上，CAIRNS在多数指标上优于基线方法；消融实验全面验证各组件有效性；LLM评估结果与人工判断呈显著相关性。

Conclusion: CAIRNS实现了无需微调或强化学习的高可读性、可验证、领域扎根的问答能力，为农业气候适应决策支持提供了实用新范式。

Abstract: Climate adaptation strategies are proposed in response to climate change. They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics. Our thorough ablation study confirms the results on all metrics. To validate our LLM-based evaluation, we also report an analysis of correlations against human judgment.

*Boya Zhang,Alban Bornet,Rui Yang,Nan Liu,Douglas Teodoro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出HealthContradict数据集，用于评估语言模型在存在冲突的长 biomedical 文本背景下回答健康问题的能力，发现微调后的生物医学语言模型不仅能利用参数化知识，还能有效利用正确上下文并抵抗错误上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型如何利用上下文信息回答健康问题，以及冲突上下文对其回答的影响。

Method: 构建专家验证的HealthContradict数据集（含920个实例，每个包含健康问题、科学支持的答案及两份立场矛盾的文档），并在多种提示设置（正确/错误/矛盾上下文）下评估模型表现。

Result: 实验表明，微调后的生物医学语言模型不仅依赖预训练获得的参数化知识，还能有效利用正确上下文并抵抗错误上下文。

Conclusion: HealthContradict能更细致地区分语言模型的上下文推理能力，优于现有医学问答评估基准。

Abstract: How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

### [145] [When Does Verification Pay Off? A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02304)
*Jack Lu,Ryan Teehan,Jinran Jin,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了大语言模型（LLMs）中求解器（solver）与验证器（verifier）之间的交互机制，涵盖37个跨家族、尺寸及训练阶段的模型，在9类任务上评估自验证、同族验证与跨族验证效果，并提出‘验证器增益’（verifier gain）指标预测拒绝采样带来的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对solver-verifier交互理解有限，尤其缺乏对跨模型家族验证、以及后训练对验证能力影响的系统分析。

Method: 在37个模型（覆盖多个家族、参数量、base/post-trained变体）和9个多样化基准上，对比自验证、同族验证与跨族验证效果；提出并验证‘verifier gain’指标；分析其与模型规模、后训练及数据集可验证性的关系。

Result: 跨家族验证效果最优；后训练削弱自验证能力但增强跨家族验证能力；数学与逻辑任务具有最高内在可验证性；verifier gain可有效预测拒绝采样收益。

Conclusion: 验证器的效果高度依赖于模型家族归属与训练方式，跨家族协同验证是一种更鲁棒、更有效的推理增强范式，且任务本身的可验证性是关键决定因素。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在医疗政策、政府福利等敏感领域面临事实一致性差、上下文对齐难的问题，难以兼顾准确性和安全性。

Method: 提出KARMA框架，包含：1）双编码器架构融合异构知识；2）门控记忆单元动态调节外部知识整合；3）安全感知可控解码器，结合安全分类与引导生成抑制不安全输出。

Result: 在专有QA数据集上实验表明，KARMA在答案质量与安全性两方面均优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: KARMA为服务场景下构建可信、自适应的问答系统提供了综合解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering (QA) systems for services face unique challenges in integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources while ensuring both accuracy and safety. Existing large language models often struggle with factual consistency and context alignment in sensitive domains such as healthcare policies and government welfare. In this work, we introduce Knowledge-Aware Reasoning and Memory-Augmented Adaptation (KARMA), a novel framework designed to enhance QA performance in care scenarios. KARMA incorporates a dual-encoder architecture to fuse structured and unstructured knowledge sources, a gated memory unit to dynamically regulate external knowledge integration, and a safety-aware controllable decoder that mitigates unsafe outputs using safety classification and guided generation techniques. Extensive experiments on a proprietary QA dataset demonstrate that KARMA outperforms strong baselines in both answer quality and safety. This study offers a comprehensive solution for building trustworthy and adaptive QA systems in service contexts.

### [147] [TaleFrame: An Interactive Story Generation System with Fine-Grained Control and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02402)
*Yunchao Wang,Guodao Sun,Zihang Fu,Zhehao Liu,Kaixing Du,Haidong Gao,Ronghua Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出TaleFrame系统，通过结合大语言模型与人机交互技术，利用结构化数据（实体、事件、关系、故事大纲）实现对故事生成的精细控制，并通过JSON2Story方法将结构化数据转化为连贯故事，支持用户直观编辑与迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前故事生成系统难以准确将用户意图转化为满意的故事输出，主要由于缺乏细粒度控制和输入规范不明确。

Method: 提出TaleFrame系统，将故事结构分解为实体、事件、关系和故事大纲四个基本单元；基于Tinystories数据集构建9851条JSON格式偏好数据集，微调本地Llama模型；采用JSON2Story方法将结构化数据转为自然语言故事；设计支持拖拽、连接等操作的直观界面；支持七维自动评估与反馈驱动的迭代优化。

Result: 定量评估与用户研究表明TaleFrame有效提升了用户对故事生成过程的控制力与最终输出满意度；配套数据集已开源。

Conclusion: TaleFrame通过结构化建模与人机协同机制，显著增强了故事生成系统的可控性、可解释性与实用性，为创意NLG系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: With the advancement of natural language generation (NLG) technologies, creative story generation systems have gained increasing attention. However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

*Francesco Paolo Savatteri,Chahan Vidal-Gorène,Florian Cafiero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过评估驱动的研究，比较了文本嵌入（RoBERTa、Mistral）、轻量数值特征（如时间、粉丝数）和序列模型（GRU、Transformer等）在假新闻检测与传播性预测两个任务上的表现；发现文本内容对假新闻检测效果显著，而数值特征在资源受限时仍具可行性；传播性预测更难且对标签定义敏感，需谨慎设计评估方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对在线虚假信息治理中需快速响应的实际需求，开展假新闻检测与传播性预测的实用化评估研究，弥补现有工作在操作性、可复现性与评估设计上的不足。

Method: 基于EVONS和FakeNewsNet数据集，对比分析文本嵌入（RoBERTa/Mistral）、轻量数值特征及多种序列模型（GRU、门控架构、Transformer编码器）；结合t-SNE/PCA降维分析、不同标签构造（如中位数划分“病毒性”）与时间截断策略进行系统评估。

Result: 文本嵌入在假新闻检测中性能突出；数值特征管道在无语言模型时仍有效；传播性预测难度更高，对标签定义和时间敏感；t-SNE在数值特征上优于PCA；Mistral替换RoBERTa仅带来微小变化；API限制使真实场景下的时间截断难以实施。

Conclusion: 假新闻检测可依赖强文本信号，而传播性预测需更鲁棒的标签与特征工程；评估设计应贴近实际部署约束；研究强调可复现性挑战并开源部分代码与划分，提供指标选择指南。

Abstract: We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

(3) Large-Scale Agentic Task Synthesis Pipeline: To integrate reasoning into tool-use scenarios, we developed a novel synthesis pipeline that systematically generates training data at scale. This methodology facilitates scalable agentic post-training, yielding substantial improvements in generalization and instruction-following robustness within complex, interactive environments.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在后训练大语言模型时， indiscriminately 混合正负优势信号，尤其在早期阶段易导致指导模糊、增益有限。

Method: 提出CAPO（课程优势策略优化），一种基于优势信号的自适应课程机制：初期仅使用正优势样本进行模仿学习以构建稳健基础，后期逐步引入负优势信号以培养判别能力。兼容GRPO、PPO、RLOO、Reinforce++等多种优化方法。

Result: 在数学推理任务中实现稳定且显著的性能提升，并有效泛化至多模态GUI推理场景。

Conclusion: CAPO是一种通用、鲁棒的优化框架，能通过课程式优势信号调度提升大语言模型的推理泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a paradigm for post-training large language models, boosting their reasoning capabilities. Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.

*Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）在生成多文档摘要时存在显著的首因效应（primacy effect），即更倾向于与最先输入的文档在语义上保持一致，而对后续文档权重较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型（如Gemini 2.5 Flash）在处理多个长文档输入时是否平等加权各输入，尤其在敏感议题（如堕胎新闻）的摘要生成中是否存在顺序偏差。

Method: 构建40组立场互为支持-中立-反对的新闻文章三元组，每组进行6种输入顺序排列，用Gemini 2.5 Flash生成中立摘要；采用ROUGE-L、BERTScore和SummaC三项指标评估摘要质量，并通过单因素方差分析（ANOVA）及事后两两比较检验位置效应。

Result: BERTScore显示显著首因效应：位置1摘要语义相似度显著高于位置2和3，而位置2与3之间无显著差异；ROUGE-L和SummaC未呈现一致显著趋势。

Conclusion: LLM摘要生成存在系统性输入顺序偏差，尤其表现为对首个文档的语义偏好，这对依赖LLM摘要的实际应用（如AI概览、智能体决策链）构成事实一致性与公平性风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in settings such as Google's AI Overviews, where it summarizes multiple long documents. However, it remains unclear whether they weight all inputs equally. Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document. The findings present risks for applications that rely on LLM-generated overviews and for agentic AI systems, where the steps involving LLMs can disproportionately influence downstream actions.

TL;DR: 本文对七种模型融合算法在大型语言模型（LLM）偏见缓解中的效果进行了实证评估，发现存在偏见降低与下游任务性能下降之间的权衡；其中SLERP在中等插值权重下表现最平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型继承并可能放大训练数据中的社会偏见，威胁公平性与社会信任；现有基于参数编辑的去偏方法缺乏系统性实证比较。

Method: 对Linear、Karcher Mean、SLERP、NuSLERP、TIES、DELLA和Nearswap七种模型融合算法，在GPT、LLaMA和Qwen系列共13个开源模型上进行实证评测；使用BBQ、BOLD和HONEST三个偏见数据集评估偏见缓解效果，并通过SuperGLUE基准测试衡量下游任务性能影响。

Result: 发现偏见缓解与下游性能存在明显权衡：强去偏方法显著降低阅读理解、常识与因果推理类任务准确率；Linear、SLERP和Nearswap在保持整体性能的同时稳定减偏，其中SLERP在中等插值权重下最为均衡。

Conclusion: 模型融合是可行的偏见缓解路径，但过度去偏或选用不当方法会损害关键语言能力，需在公平性与能力间寻求平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

TL;DR: CREST是一个支持100种语言的高效跨语言安全分类模型，仅用13种高资源语言训练即可在低资源语言中实现良好泛化，以0.5B参数量在多个安全基准上优于同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM内容安全机制主要面向高资源语言，忽视了使用低资源语言的大量用户，导致全球覆盖不均。需要一种可扩展、跨语言的安全解决方案。

Method: 提出CREST模型，采用基于聚类的跨语言迁移策略，在13种高资源语言上训练一个0.5B参数的多语言安全分类器，通过参数高效方式扩展至100种语言。

Result: 在六个安全基准上评估显示，CREST优于同规模最先进模型，并与更大规模模型（2.5B以上）表现相当，尤其在低资源语言上展现更强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语言特定的安全机制存在局限，应发展通用、语言无关的安全系统；CREST验证了跨语言迁移在构建全球适用安全护栏中的有效性。

Abstract: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

### [155] [Emergent Bayesian Behaviour and Optimal Cue Combination in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719)
*Julian Ma,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过借鉴心理物理学范式，提出BayesBench基准和贝叶斯一致性评分，系统评估大语言模型在多模态感知任务中是否表现出类似人类的贝叶斯推理行为，发现尽管某些模型准确率高，但其不确定性处理策略可能并不稳健，揭示了性能与策略之间的分离现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在未经显式训练的情况下是否能像人类一样采用近似最优的贝叶斯策略进行多模态信息整合，揭示其隐含的计算机制。

Method: 构建受经典心理物理学启发的四类幅度估计任务（长度、位置、距离、持续时间），涵盖文本与图像模态，形成BayesBench基准；对九个LLM进行行为实验，并引入贝叶斯一致性评分来检测模型在不同噪声、上下文和提示条件下的行为变化。

Result: 发现高性能模型常表现出符合贝叶斯预期的行为调整，但准确性不能保证鲁棒性；GPT-5 Mini虽在文本任务上达到完美准确率，却无法有效整合视觉线索，显示出能力与策略的分离；准确性与贝叶斯倾向存在相关性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型展现出类似人类的原则性不确定性处理能力，但仅依赖准确性评估会忽略其脆弱的策略表现，需引入如贝叶斯一致性等新指标以更全面评估模型行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

Result: 实验表明，通用长文本或论文写作系统生成的综述质量较低，而专用综述生成系统表现显著更优。

Conclusion: SurveyEval可作为可扩展的测试平台，助力理解与提升跨学科、多标准的自动综述生成系统。

Abstract: LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

As a result, PEFT-Factory provides a ready-to-use, controlled, and stable environment, improving replicability and benchmarking of PEFT methods. PEFT-Factory is a downstream framework that originates from the popular LLaMA-Factory, and is publicly available at https://github.com/kinit-sk/PEFT-Factory

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在训练与评估域分布不一致时表现不佳，且缺乏足够的对话指代标注数据。

Method: 提出一种三层次数据合成方法，在真实性和可控性之间取得平衡，以生成可扩展的对话条件下的指代定位监督数据。

Result: 在合成数据上微调后，模型在标准评估指标上持续、显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该数据合成方法有效缓解了分布偏移和数据稀缺问题，为对话式指代理解提供了更鲁棒和可扩展的训练范式。

Abstract: Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC) requires models to ground the expression and unlimited targets in complex visual scenes while resolving coreference across a long dialogue context. However, existing systems struggle under distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a gap exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data. We address this challenge with a three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding. Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出TriLex框架，通过三阶段检索增强方法扩展低资源非洲语言的情感词典，并验证其在AfroXLMR和AfriBERTa模型上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源非洲语言在情感分析中代表性不足，导致词汇覆盖有限及多语言NLP系统性能受限。

Method: 提出TriLex三阶段检索增强框架，整合语料库抽取、跨语言映射和检索增强生成（RAG）驱动的词典精炼。

Result: AfroXLMR在isiXhosa和isiZulu上F1得分超80%，AfriBERTa达约64%；两者均优于传统机器学习基线，集成分析进一步提升精度与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TriLex是可扩展且有效的多语言情感词典扩展与低资源南非语言情感建模框架。

Abstract: Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

### [160] [SR-GRPO: Stable Rank as an Intrinsic Geometric Reward for Large Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02807)
*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需外部标注的内在质量信号——稳定秩（stable rank），用于大语言模型对齐，通过模型隐状态的有效维度度量信息分布，并基于此提出了无监督强化学习算法SR-GRPO，在多个任务上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法依赖外部监督（如人工标注、奖励模型或自评），存在稀缺性、主观性、奖励黑客及提示敏感等问题，亟需一种内在、鲁棒、无需标注的质量评估方式。

Method: 提出稳定秩作为内在质量信号，定义为隐状态总方差与主方向方差之比；基于该信号设计无监督强化学习算法SR-GRPO（Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization），用于优化策略。

Result: 稳定秩在RewardBench上达84.04%准确率，Best-of-N采样中平均提升任务准确率11.3个百分点；SR-GRPO使Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct在STEM和数学推理任务上分别提升10%和19%，优于有监督奖励模型与自评基线。

Conclusion: 模型内部表征几何结构可提供可靠质量信号，稳定秩为实现可扩展、无外部监督的大模型对齐提供了新范式。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

Conclusion: TCM-BEST4SDT是首个面向中医辨证论治全流程的综合性评估基准，兼顾临床真实性与可计算性，已开源以推动智能中医研究发展。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

Conclusion: BOOM为多语言教育提供了一种完整、可访问、模态一致的本地化解决方案，推动多模态机器翻译在教育场景中的实际应用。

Abstract: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering. We release our Slide Translation code at https://github.com/saikoneru/image-translator and integrate it in Lecture Translator at https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/isl-ai4lt/lt-middleware/ltpipeline}\footnote{All released code and models are licensed under the MIT License.

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

TL;DR: 本文研究了低资源语言Bangla中的仇恨言论识别问题，通过对比多种基线方法和基于Transformer的预训练模型（如BanglaBERT、m-BERT、XLM-RoBERTa等），发现针对Bangla语言专门预训练的BanglaBERT在仇恨言论检测子任务中表现最优，验证了语言特定预训练对低资源语言的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla作为使用人数超2.3亿的低资源语言，在计算资源和标注数据方面严重不足，而社交媒体平台对其自动内容审核的需求日益增长，亟需高效可靠的仇恨言论识别方法。

Method: 复现BLP 2025共享任务Subtask 1A和1B的官方基线（如多数类、随机、SVM），并新增Logistic Regression、Random Forest、Decision Tree等传统机器学习基线；同时采用DistilBERT、BanglaBERT、m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa等Transformer模型进行微调与比较。

Result: 所有Transformer模型均优于传统基线（DistilBERT除外）；其中BanglaBERT在两个子任务上性能最佳，甚至超越参数量更大的m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa。

Conclusion: 语言特定的预训练对提升低资源语言（如Bangla）的仇恨言论识别性能至关重要，应加强针对此类语言的预训练模型研发与应用。

Abstract: Hate speech recognition in low-resource languages remains a difficult problem due to insufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the growing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under-represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official baselines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vector Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. We also utilized transformer-based models such as DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods for the subtasks, except for DistilBERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language-specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre-trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language.

TL;DR: 本文提出ThinkMerge，一种无需训练、即插即用的解码策略，通过在同步点平均K条并行推理路径的下一个词logits来生成单一连贯输出，显著提升开放性推理任务（如代码生成和基于网页的深度研究）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多数投票在封闭式问答中有效，但在开放式推理（如代码生成、网页深度研究）中因无法定义完整解的‘多数’而难以直接应用。

Method: ThinkMerge运行K条并行推理路径，并在同步点对它们的下一个token logits进行平均，生成单一输出；兼容vLLM/SGLang及Top-p/Top-k等标准解码技术。

Result: 在AIME和GPQA上媲美或超越多数投票；在LiveCodeBench（hard）上，DeepCoder-14B-Preview和Qwen3-8B的pass@1分别提升+8.28%和+7.58%；在GAIA、BrowseComp-en/zh、XbenchDeepSearch等网页深度研究基准上也取得提升。

Conclusion: ThinkMerge证明了并行测试时扩展可在不依赖完整输出投票的前提下，有效提升开放性推理性能。

Abstract: Majority voting has proven effective for close-ended question answering by aggregating parallel reasoning traces. However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k. Empirically, it matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, while delivering consistent gains on open-ended coding tasks: on LiveCodeBench (hard), pass@1 improves by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B. Beyond code, we further show that ThinkMerge improves web-based deep-research agents (e.g., WebSailor-7B/32B) across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch. These results demonstrate that parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SchED是一种无需训练、模型无关的早期退出算法，用于加速扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）的解码过程，在保持几乎全部性能的同时实现显著的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然有潜力，但因迭代采样缓慢而限制了实际应用，需要一种高效且通用的加速方法。

Method: 提出SchED算法，通过聚合全跨度logit margin，并在达到平滑的、进度依赖的置信度阈值时提前终止解码；无需训练且适用于不同模型。

Result: 在Dream和LLaDA两类dLLM上验证，指令调优模型实现3.8-4.0倍加速并保留99.8%-100%性能，基础模型最高达2.34倍加速且性能保留99.1%-100%；在QPS指标下优于现有方法，尤其在长文本生成中更稳定。

Conclusion: SchED通过将真实的置信度稳定转化为计算节省，显著提升了dLLM解码效率，是当前最先进的训练-free早期退出方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

Method: 提出NPU原生VLM架构AutoNeural：1）采用MobileNetV5风格深度可分离卷积主干替代ViT，保障INT4/8/16量化下的激活分布有界；2）语言主干融合SSM思想与Transformer，使用门控卷积实现线性时间复杂度，消除KV缓存带来的内存I/O开销。

Result: 相比基线，视觉编码器量化误差降低最多7倍，端到端延迟降低14倍，解码速度提升3倍，上下文窗口长度提升4倍；在高通SA8295P芯片上验证了座舱应用的实时性能。

Conclusion: 针对NPU硬件约束重新设计模型拓扑结构，是实现鲁棒多模态边缘智能的先决条件；整数原生、低I/O、高计算密度的架构设计比单纯模型压缩更有效。

Abstract: While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence.

*Muyu Pan,Dheeraj Kodakandla,Mahfuza Farooque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合经典NLP技术、自定义语法、符号计算库与微调语言模型的新框架，用于将自然语言句子准确翻译为逻辑表达式并转为CNF，以降低LLM在逻辑翻译中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在将自然语言自动翻译为形式逻辑时易产生幻觉，而逻辑翻译任务对精度要求极高，亟需提升可靠性。

Method: 采用自定义语法的古典NLP技术、符号计算库（如SymPy）以及针对不同语法设置微调的语言模型，将英文句子→逻辑表达式→CNF，并利用微调模型主动修正原始模型的特定幻觉类型。

Result: 初步实验表明，微调模型能稳定识别并纠正原始LLM在逻辑翻译中反复出现的同类幻觉，显著提升CNF生成的可靠性。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效缓解了LLM在形式化逻辑翻译中的幻觉问题，为自动化推理、程序验证与规约一致性检查提供了更可信的端到端逻辑生成路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

*Saeid Jamshidi,Kawser Wazed Nafi,Arghavan Moradi Dakhel,Negar Shahabi,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需数据集、闭环式的道德一致性评估框架MoCoP，用于持续评估大语言模型（LLMs）在不同语境下的伦理稳定性；该框架包含词汇完整性分析、语义风险估计和基于推理的判断建模三层，实证表明其能有效捕捉LLM长期伦理行为，并揭示伦理性与毒性呈强负相关，而与响应延迟几乎无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大语言模型（LLMs）的对齐方法多依赖静态数据集和事后评估，难以反映伦理推理在不同上下文或时间尺度上的演化，因此亟需一种能动态、连续评估模型道德一致性的新范式。

Method: 提出道德一致性管道（MoCoP），一种数据集无关、闭环自维持框架，整合三层：（i）词汇完整性分析，（ii）语义风险估计，（iii）基于推理的判断建模；框架可自主生成、评估并优化伦理场景，无需人工监督。

Result: 在GPT-4-Turbo和DeepSeek上验证显示：伦理维度与毒性维度呈强负相关（rET = -0.81, p < 0.001），与响应延迟几乎无关（rEL ≈ 0）；表明道德一致性与语言安全性是模型稳定、可解释的行为特征。

Conclusion: MoCoP将伦理评估重构为一种动态、模型无关的道德内省过程，为可扩展、可持续的AI系统审计提供了可复现基础，并推动了计算道德学在自主AI中的研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: Diabetes is a serious worldwide health issue, and successful intervention depends on early detection. However, overlapping risk factors and data asymmetry make prediction difficult. To use extensive health survey data to create a machine learning framework for diabetes classification that is both accurate and comprehensible, to produce results that will aid in clinical decision-making. Using the BRFSS dataset, we assessed a number of supervised learning techniques. SMOTE and Tomek Links were used to correct class imbalance.

The 2015 BRFSS dataset, which includes roughly 253,680 records with 22 numerical features, is used in this study. Strong ROC-AUC performance of approximately 0.96 was attained by the individual models Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.The stacking ensemble with XGBoost and KNN yielded the best overall results with 94.82\% accuracy, ROC-AUC of 0.989, and PR-AUC of 0.991, indicating a favourable balance between recall and precision. In our study, we proposed and developed a React Native-based application with a Python Flask backend to support early diabetes prediction, providing users with an accessible and efficient health monitoring tool.

Motivation: 传统基于药效团的虚拟筛选方法在面对大规模分子库时计算成本高、扩展性差，且只能从已有库中筛选分子，无法生成全新结构。

Method: 提出VoxCap——一种将体素化分子表示映射为SMILES字符串的体素标注方法，并构建两种工作流：基于药效团的从头分子生成和结合2D子结构相似性搜索的快速筛选流程。

Result: VoxCap在生成多样化的从头命中分子方面显著优于先前方法；结合快速搜索流程后，计算时间降低数个数量级，且对所有查询分子均能返回有效命中，可处理传统暴力搜索无法应对的大规模库。

Conclusion: VoxCap通过生成式建模突破了传统药效团筛选的瓶颈，在保持高药效团-形状匹配度的同时，提升了多样性、效率与可扩展性，为配体导向药物发现提供了新范式。

Abstract: Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.

TL;DR: 本文提出PIBNet，一种基于物理启发的图神经网络，用于高效近似边界元法中多散射问题的边界解迹，显著提升计算效率与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边界元法（BEM）在求解无界域多散射问题时虽高效，但求解边界积分方程是主要计算瓶颈；现有学习方法泛化性不足，尤其在障碍物数量增加时性能下降。

Method: 提出PIBNet：1）采用物理启发的图建模策略表征障碍物及其长程相互作用；2）设计新型多尺度图神经网络架构模拟多散射过程；3）构建包含多种多散射问题的数据集用于训练与评估。

Result: PIBNet在多个任务上超越现有最先进学习方法，并在障碍物数量增加的新场景中展现出更强泛化能力。

Conclusion: PIBNet为BEM中的边界解迹预测提供了一种高效、可扩展且泛化性强的学习替代方案，推动了物理信息机器学习在波动问题中的应用。

Abstract: The boundary element method (BEM) provides an efficient numerical framework for solving multiple scattering problems in unbounded homogeneous domains, since it reduces the discretization to the domain boundaries, thereby condensing the computational complexity. The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems. The results indicate that our approach not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods on the considered tasks but also exhibits superior generalization to settings with an increased number of obstacles. github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/pibnet

Method: 提出SFL Transformer模型，设计Contextual Gating机制，在BERT中间层调制隐藏状态序列，用低维结构特征（Fstruct）动态调节深度语义特征（Hseq）。

Result: 在UMAP降维的歌词嵌入二分类任务上，准确率和宏F1均达0.9910，超越先前SFL模型（0.9894）；同时具备优异校准性（ECE=0.0081，Log Loss=0.0489）。

Conclusion: 在Transformer中间层注入辅助结构信息是最有效的特征协同方式，可兼顾高判别性能与高保真概率估计。

Abstract: This study introduces a significant architectural advancement in feature fusion for lyrical content classification by integrating auxiliary structural features directly into the self-attention mechanism of a pre-trained Transformer. I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489). This work validates the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack is the most effective means of synergistically combining structural and semantic information, creating a model with both superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.

Abstract: The industrial adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Engineering (AI4E) faces two fundamental bottlenecks: scarce high-quality data and the lack of interpretability in black-box models-particularly critical in safety-sensitive sectors like aerospace. We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models. Our approach provides a general blueprint for developing trustworthy AI systems that embed engineering domain knowledge directly into their architecture, enabling reliable adoption in high-stakes industrial applications where data is limited but physical understanding is available.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了四种自主定价算法（Q-Learning、PSO、Double DQN、DDPG）在三种双头垄断市场模型（Logit、Hotelling、Linear）及不同需求冲击下的竞争行为，发现强化学习算法在稳定需求下易维持超竞争价格，且市场结构和需求不确定性显著影响算法表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对自主定价算法在现实需求条件下行为的系统分析，尤其是在不同市场结构和需求波动环境下的竞争影响。

Method: 采用四种定价算法在Logit、Hotelling和Linear三类经典双寡头市场模型中进行模拟，结合基于利润和价格的共谋指数，并引入自回归过程生成多种需求冲击情景，评估算法间的交互影响。

Result: 强化学习算法（尤其是DDPG）在需求稳定时倾向于维持超竞争价格，表现出共谋倾向；需求冲击下各市场反应不同：Logit市场表现显著下降，Hotelling市场保持稳定，Linear市场出现利润上升；尽管绝对表现变化大，算法间的相对性能排名保持一致。

Conclusion: 市场结构与需求不确定性在塑造算法竞争行为中起关键作用，研究结果对数字市场中的自主定价政策制定具有重要启示。

Abstract: Autonomous pricing algorithms are increasingly influencing competition in digital markets; however, their behavior under realistic demand conditions remains largely unexamined. This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.

Result: 在六个公开基准数据集上实现了最先进性能，仅使用0.2百万参数。

Conclusion: Ada-MoGE能有效匹配输入数据的频率分布，平衡信息保留与噪声抑制，显著提升多变量时间序列预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasts are widely used, such as industrial, transportation and financial forecasts. However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.

Result: 在八个公开基准数据集上，DPWMixer一致优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: DPWMixer通过无损多尺度分解与双路径建模，在保证计算效率的同时提升了长期时间序列预测的准确性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task in computational intelligence. While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/hit636/DPWMixer.

Abstract: Graph-based Anomaly Detection models have gained widespread adoption in recent years, identifying suspicious nodes by aggregating neighborhood information. However, most existing studies overlook the pervasive issues of missing and adversarially obscured node attributes, which can undermine aggregation stability and prediction reliability. To mitigate this, we propose FGC-Comp, a lightweight, classifier-agnostic, and deployment-friendly attribute completion module-designed to enhance neighborhood aggregation under incomplete attributes. We partition each node's neighbors into three label-based groups, apply group-specific transforms to the labeled groups while a node-conditioned gate handles unknowns, fuse messages via residual connections, and train end-to-end with a binary classification objective to improve aggregation stability and prediction reliability under missing attributes. Experiments on two real-world fraud datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to learn discriminative semantic invariance by contrasting different views of the same graph that share critical topological patterns. However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向回归任务的监督式多模态联邦特征提取方法，通过多约束对比学习框架解决非独立同分布（non-IID）、小样本及灾难性遗忘问题，提升下游回归性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现实场景中多模态数据回归面临的三大挑战：数据量少且非独立同分布（non-IID）、多模态信息有效提取与融合困难、模型学习易发生灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出任务驱动的监督式多模态联邦特征提取方法，融合多模态信息提取与对比学习机制；支持各客户端独立学习低维表征，并通过参数调节控制响应变量相关信息在低维特征中的保留程度；构建含互信息保持、对称KL散度约束和跨模态对比约束的多约束学习框架。

Result: 在仿真与真实数据实验中，该方法在下游回归任务上显著优于经典特征提取技术。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升多模态联邦学习下的回归性能，兼顾特征可解释性、任务导向性与非IID鲁棒性，为小样本多模态回归提供新范式。

Abstract: This study focuses on the feature extraction problem in multi-modal data regression. To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.

TL;DR: GraphMatch 是一种结合预训练语言模型与图神经网络的大规模推荐框架，用于解决文本丰富、动态双面市场中的匹配推荐挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在内容和交互图不断演变的文本丰富的动态双边市场中，现有推荐方法难以有效捕捉语义和时序结构，因此需要一种能同时利用文本语义和图结构的综合框架。

Method: 提出 GraphMatch 框架，将预训练语言模型与图神经网络结合，采用对抗性负采样和点时刻子图训练，联合学习文本语义和时间敏感的图结构表示。

Result: 在 Upwork 大规模数据上的实验表明，GraphMatch 在匹配任务上优于纯语言或纯图模型基线，且具有高效的运行时性能。

Conclusion: 融合语言和图表示的方法在实际应用中能有效弥合大规模预训练语言模型与大图之间的差距，为动态双边市场推荐提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recommending matches in a text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplace presents unique challenges due to evolving content and interaction graphs. We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）擅长捕捉局部结构模式，但常忽略对表示学习至关重要的全局拓扑特征，因此需要融合拓扑信息以增强图表示。

Method: 提出GraphTCL框架，通过持久同调提取拓扑嵌入，并与GNN生成的结构嵌入结合，采用跨视图对比损失对齐两个互补视角。

Result: 在TU和OGB等基准数据集上的实验表明，GraphTCL持续优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明了引入拓扑感知的对比学习对提升图表示学习的重要性。

Abstract: Graph classification has gained significant attention due to its applications in chemistry, social networks, and bioinformatics. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they often overlook global topological features that are critical for robust representation learning. In this work, we propose GraphTCL, a dual-view contrastive learning framework that integrates structural embeddings from GNNs with topological embeddings derived from persistent homology. By aligning these complementary views through a cross-view contrastive loss, our method enhances representation quality and improves classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including TU and OGB molecular graphs, demonstrate that GraphTCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This study highlights the importance of topology-aware contrastive learning for advancing graph representation methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种临床引导的对比学习方法（CLEF），利用临床风险评分自适应加权负样本对，结合常规收集的临床元数据进行无监督预训练，显著提升了单导联心电图（ECG）基础模型在多种临床任务上的性能，尤其在AUROC和MAE指标上优于现有自监督与监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ECG自监督预训练方法未有效融合临床元数据等先验知识，限制了模型在真实临床场景中的泛化能力与可解释性。

Method: 提出临床引导的对比学习（Clinically-Guided Contrastive Learning），以临床风险分数为依据动态调整负样本对的权重，并设计机制处理缺失元数据；在MIMIC-IV的161K患者12导联ECG数据上，仅用常规元数据预训练三种规模的单导联ECG基础模型（CLEF）。

Result: CLEF在7个独立测试集、18项临床任务中全面超越5个基础模型基线和3种自监督算法：在12导预训练+导联I测试下，中型CLEF平均AUROC提升≥2.6%，MAE降低≥3.2%；相比自监督算法平均AUROC提升≥1.8%；仅用导联I预训练时，性能媲美监督式SOTA模型ECGFounder。

Conclusion: CLEF通过将临床知识嵌入对比学习框架，实现了更准确、可扩展的单导联ECG分析，推动远程健康监测发展。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool in cardiovascular health. Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring. Code and pretrained CLEF models are available at: github.com/Nokia-Bell-Labs/ecg-foundation-model.

TL;DR: 本文提出有序稀疏自编码器（OSAE），通过严格排序潜在特征和确定性使用每个特征维度，解决了传统稀疏自编码器在可解释性中因随机性导致的特征不一致问题，并在理论和实验上验证了其提升特征一致性的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在神经网络可解释性中广泛应用，但其学习到的特征常因随机种子和超参数设置不同而变化，缺乏稳定性。

Method: 提出有序稀疏自编码器（OSAE），扩展Matryoshka SAE：（1）对潜在特征施加严格顺序；（2）确定性地使用所有特征维度，避免先前嵌套SAE方法中的采样近似；并从稀疏字典学习角度证明其能解决排列非唯一性问题。

Result: 在Gemma2-2B和Pythia-70M模型上的实验表明，OSAE相比Matryoshka基线显著提升了特征一致性。

Conclusion: OSAE通过结构化设计增强了稀疏自编码器的稳定性和可解释性，在理论唯一性条件和实际模型中均展现出更优的一致性表现。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been widely used for interpretability of neural networks, but their learned features often vary across seeds and hyperparameter settings. We introduce Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE), which extend Matryoshka SAEs by (1) establishing a strict ordering of latent features and (2) deterministically using every feature dimension, avoiding the sampling-based approximations of prior nested SAE methods. Theoretically, we show that OSAEs resolve permutation non-identifiability in settings of sparse dictionary learning where solutions are unique (up to natural symmetries). Empirically on Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M, we show that OSAEs can help improve consistency compared to Matryoshka baselines.

Method: 采用简单的宏观经济‘甜甜圈’模型，结合随机森林分类器识别符合‘生活在甜甜圈内’的政策参数，并使用Q学习强化学习算法寻找向理想政策演进的最优轨迹。

Result: 证明了轻量级机器学习方法（如随机森林和Q学习）能够有效识别满足双重可持续性目标的政策参数组合，并能在参数空间中找到通向这些政策的最优路径。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法可有效支持‘甜甜圈’框架下的政策分析，未来工作将把该方法应用于更复杂的生态宏观经济模型中。

Abstract: The 'Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries has emerged as a popular framework for assessing environmental and social sustainability. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability. The next step is the application of these methods to a more complex ecological macroeconomic model.

Motivation: 抹香鲸通过咔哒声进行交流，但高质量、多样化的咔哒声数据稀缺，限制了对其语言结构和社交行为的研究；亟需能生成逼真、可控制的合成咔哒声的模型以支持生物声学分析。

Method: 基于VampNet（一个在音乐音频上预训练的掩码声学标记模型），使用过去二十年收集的10,000条咔哒声录音进行微调，构建WhAM模型；采用迭代掩码标记预测策略生成合成codas。

Result: WhAM生成的合成codas具有高保真度，保留原始录音的关键声学特征；在Fréchet Audio Distance评估和专家生物学家感知研究中表现优异；其学习到的表征在节奏、社会单元和元音分类等下游任务中达到强性能。

Conclusion: WhAM是首个能从任意音频提示生成抹香鲸咔哒声的Transformer模型，证明了跨领域（音乐→鲸类声学）模型迁移的有效性，为非人类动物通信研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Sperm whales communicate in short sequences of clicks known as codas. We present WhAM (Whale Acoustics Model), the first transformer-based model capable of generating synthetic sperm whale codas from any audio prompt. WhAM is built by finetuning VampNet, a masked acoustic token model pretrained on musical audio, using 10k coda recordings collected over the past two decades. Through iterative masked token prediction, WhAM generates high-fidelity synthetic codas that preserve key acoustic features of the source recordings. We evaluate WhAM's synthetic codas using Fréchet Audio Distance and through perceptual studies with expert marine biologists. On downstream classification tasks including rhythm, social unit, and vowel classification, WhAM's learned representations achieve strong performance, despite being trained for generation rather than classification.

Result: 构建了ZarmaInstruct-50k、BambaraInstruct-50k和FulfuldeInstruct-50k三个多领域、各含5万条指令的低资源语言基准数据集。

Conclusion: InstructLR能有效提升低资源语言指令数据质量，为相关语言的文本生成与对话系统提供可靠数据基础。

Abstract: Effective text generation and chat interfaces for low-resource languages (LRLs) remain a challenge for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to support. This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer. Drawing inspiration from benchmarks such as MMLU in task definition, InstructLR has facilitated the creation of three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k.

Abstract: We study the problem of online model selection in reinforcement learning, where the selector has access to a class of reinforcement learning agents and learns to adaptively select the agent with the right configuration. Our goal is to establish the improved efficiency and performance gains achieved by integrating online model selection methods into reinforcement learning training procedures. We examine the theoretical characterizations that are effective for identifying the right configuration in practice, and address three practical criteria from a theoretical perspective: 1) Efficient resource allocation, 2) Adaptation under non-stationary dynamics, and 3) Training stability across different seeds. Our theoretical results are accompanied by empirical evidence from various model selection tasks in reinforcement learning, including neural architecture selection, step-size selection, and self model selection.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly influence safety-critical aspects of society, from medical diagnosis to autonomous mobility, making uncertainty awareness a central requirement for trustworthy AI. We present a photonic Bayesian machine that leverages the inherent randomness of chaotic light sources to enable uncertainty reasoning within the framework of Bayesian Neural Networks.

We use the system for simultaneous classification and out-of-domain detection of blood cell microscope images and demonstrate reasoning between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The photonic Bayesian machine removes the bottleneck of pseudo random number generation in digital systems, minimizes the cost of sampling for probabilistic models, and thus enables high-speed trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Inferring the phylogenetic relationships among a sample of organisms is a fundamental problem in modern biology. While distance-based hierarchical clustering algorithms achieved early success on this task, these have been supplanted by Bayesian and maximum likelihood search procedures based on complex models of molecular evolution. In this work we describe minimal neural network architectures that can approximate classic phylogenetic distance functions and the properties required to learn distances under a variety of molecular evolutionary models. In contrast to model-based inference (and recently proposed model-free convolutional and transformer networks), these architectures have a small computational footprint and are scalable to large numbers of taxa and molecular characters. The learned distance functions generalize well and, given an appropriate training dataset, achieve results comparable to state-of-the art inference methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在医疗健康领域中，通过偏差缓解技术提升模型公平性如何影响基于Shapley值的特征重要性排序，发现公平性增强可能导致不同种族子组间特征重要性排序发生显著且不一致的变化，提示需联合评估准确性、公平性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床信任依赖于模型的预测性能、公平性和可解释性；然而，目前尚不清楚提升公平性会对可解释性（尤其是特征重要性排序）产生何种影响，而这一变化可能影响临床医生对模型的信任与采用。

Method: 采用多种偏差缓解技术提升模型公平性，使用Shapley值计算特征重要性，并在三个真实医疗/社会风险数据集（儿童尿路感染风险、直接抗凝剂出血风险、再犯风险）上量化公平性约束前后特征排名的变化；同时评估多种模型类别下Shapley排序的稳定性。

Result: 提升模型在种族亚组间的公平性会显著改变Shapley-based特征重要性排序，且这种变化在不同亚组间可能方向不一致；不同模型类别的排序稳定性也存在差异。

Conclusion: 准确性、公平性与可解释性不可孤立评估，必须协同考量，尤其在高风险医疗决策场景中，公平性调整可能隐性削弱临床可解释性与信任基础。

Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning in healthcare requires strong predictive performance, fairness, and explanations. While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. These results highlight the need to jointly consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability in model assessment rather than in isolation.

*Jane Lange,Mingda Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在可测试学习（testable learning）模型中成员查询（MQ）的作用，证明了MQ无法显著降低时间复杂度，并通过归约方法将可测试学习与统计查询（SQ）和反证（refutation）联系起来，指出许多基于MQ的高效学习器无法满足可测试性要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解成员查询（MQ）在可测试学习模型中是否能带来实质性的效率提升，以及其与样本学习、统计查询和反证之间的理论关系。

Method: 通过构造从样本式布尔概念类反证到带查询的可测试学习（TL-Q）的通用归约；结合已知的从学习到反证的归约；定义并分析一类‘统计型’MQ算法，并将其与统计查询反证和学习关联。

Result: 1) 在可测试学习模型中，MQ不能使时间复杂度优于分布特异性PAC学习；2) TL-Q算法若属于统计型MQ类，则可导出高效的SQ反证与学习算法；3) 结合SQ维下界，表明许多高效MQ学习器不可测试。

Conclusion: 成员查询在可测试学习中不提供超越样本学习的时间优势；统计型MQ学习器与SQ能力紧密耦合，因而受限于SQ下界，无法实现可测试性。

Abstract: Membership queries (MQ) often yield speedups for learning tasks, particularly in the distribution-specific setting. We show that in the \emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.
  We give a general reduction from sample-based \emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.
  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种衡量模型学习对称性（特别是3D旋转等变性）效果的原理性指标——等变误差，并在分子建模任务中验证：模型可在1k–10k步内快速将等变误差降至测试损失的≤2%；且学习等变性本身比主预测任务更简单（损失曲面更平滑、条件更好）；但非等变模型因无等变约束，初期训练效率可能更高，需缩小‘等变效率差距’才能体现优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据增强被广泛用于训练对称性无关的模型，但尚不清楚它们学习并尊重对称性（如3D旋转等变性）的速度与效果。

Method: 推导了基于凸损失的等变误差度量，量化模型损失中由对称性缺陷所导致的比例；在多个高维分子任务（流匹配、力场预测、体素去噪）上实证分析3D旋转等变性的学习动态，并结合理论分析梯度、参数与等变误差的关系。

Result: 模型在1k–10k训练步内即可将等变误差控制在≤2%的预留损失内；该快速收敛源于等变性学习任务具有更平滑、病态性更低的损失景观；而非等变模型在整个训练过程中损失惩罚较小，单位GPU小时的测试损失可能更低。

Conclusion: 学习3D旋转等变性是一个相对容易的子任务，但当前等变模型存在‘效率差距’；未来需优化等变架构或训练策略以提升其实际训练效率。

Abstract: While data augmentation is widely used to train symmetry-agnostic models, it remains unclear how quickly and effectively they learn to respect symmetries. We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\leq$2\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的Boltzmann机学习框架SAL，结合了受模拟分岔启发的并行化采样器Langevin SB（LSB）与逆温度估计方法条件期望匹配（CEM），在保持高精度的同时显著提升训练效率，适用于一般耦合结构的Boltzmann机而不仅限于RBM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Boltzmann机因MCMC采样难以并行、训练开销大而受限；受限Boltzmann机虽可用对比散度高效训练，但表达能力有限。亟需一种兼顾并行性、准确性与通用性的新学习方法。

Method: 提出Langevin SB（LSB）采样器——受量子启发的模拟分岔算法改进版，支持并行采样且适用于一般Boltzmann机；为解决LSB无法控制逆温度的问题，进一步提出条件期望匹配（CEM）方法实时估计逆温度；二者结合构成sampler-adaptive learning（SAL）框架。

Result: SAL在保持与MCMC相当采样精度的同时实现高效并行化，成功应用于一般耦合Boltzmann机训练，实验验证其优于传统RBM训练方法，在生成建模任务中展现出更强表达能力。

Conclusion: SAL为超越RBM的能量基生成模型提供了实用、高效且通用的新学习范式，推动Boltzmann机在实际场景中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.

*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向概念漂移在线学习的检索增强记忆方法RAM-OL，通过在隐空间中检索近邻样本来联合更新模型，在多个真实数据流上验证了其有效性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强模型在流式监督学习和概念漂移场景下的应用尚不明确，需探索如何有效利用历史信息应对非平稳环境。

Method: 提出RAM-OL方法：在SGD基础上维护一个小规模经验缓冲区，每步在隐空间中检索若干最近邻样本，并与当前样本联合更新模型；对比朴素重放与带时间窗、相似度阈值和梯度重加权的门控重放变体。

Result: 在电力价格、电力负荷和航空延误三个真实数据流上，RAM-OL在强周期性漂移流中预序准确率提升约7个百分点且方差显著降低；在噪声较大的航空流中，门控变体性能接近纯在线基线。

Conclusion: 检索增强记忆是一种实用且鲁棒的在线学习工具，能有效应对概念漂移，尤其在模式重复出现时可降低适应成本并改善遗憾界常数。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented models couple parametric predictors with non-parametric memories, but their use in streaming supervised learning with concept drift is not well understood. We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.

*Sai Siddharth Nalamalpu,Kaining Yuan,Aiden Zhou,Eugene Pinsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了10种统计和机器学习模型对波士顿MBTA地铁系统次日客流量的预测性能，并在延迟次数预测中引入一种自激点过程模型，扩展至11种模型。研究表明，相较于天气数据， weekday 或 season 特征更能提升预测准确性，而加入天气数据反而可能导致过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBTA系统常面临延误和客流波动，影响运营效率与乘客满意度。为提升预测精度，需比较不同模型在预测地铁进站人数和系统延误次数上的表现，并识别关键影响因素。

Method: 采用10种统计与机器学习模型预测次日地铁客流量，在延迟预测中额外引入自激点过程模型（共11种）。通过RMSE评估模型性能，并实验性地选择性加入特征（如星期、季节、天气等）以分析特征重要性。

Result: 实验发现，仅提供‘星期’或‘季节’信息比加入天气数据（气温、降水、风速等）更能提升预测准确性；引入天气数据通常会降低模型性能，表明模型易因这些特征过拟合。

Conclusion: 在预测MBTA系统客流量和延误时，简单的时间特征（如星期、季节）优于复杂的天气变量。过度依赖天气特征可能引发过拟合，因此应谨慎选择输入特征以提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the main public transit provider in Boston, operating multiple means of transport, including trains, subways, and buses. However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务对长上下文生成需求增加，传统推测解码在长上下文下验证成为瓶颈，需更高效的加速方法。

Method: 提出SpecPV，采用轻量级草稿模型生成候选token，并利用部分KV缓存进行快速验证，周期性执行全量验证以纠正错误。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准和模型（如LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3系列）上验证，SpecPV相比标准自回归解码最高实现6倍加速，性能损失极小。

Conclusion: SpecPV有效缓解了长上下文下推测解码的验证瓶颈，显著提升解码效率，具备良好通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Growing demands from tasks like code generation, deep reasoning, and long-document understanding have made long-context generation a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs). Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线联邦强化学习（FRL）方法在客户端日志行为策略质量差异大（即混合质量数据）时性能显著下降，亟需提升鲁棒性。

Method: 提出FOVA框架：1）引入投票机制，在本地策略评估中识别高回报动作，缓解低质量行为影响；2）基于优势加权回归（AWR）构建一致的局部与全局训练目标；3）提供严格的策略改进理论分析。

Result: FOVA在多个标准基准上显著超越现有离线FRL基线方法，且理论证明其学习策略严格优于行为策略。

Conclusion: FOVA通过投票机制与AWR协同设计，有效提升了离线FRL在混合质量数据下的性能、训练效率与稳定性，兼具理论保证与实证优势。

Abstract: Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GPOMDP的梯度估计算法，用于在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）中直接优化策略性能，该算法仅需单条样本路径、一个自由参数β，并且无需知道底层状态；作者证明了其收敛性，并展示了如何将其梯度估计与共轭梯度法结合以寻找平均奖励的局部最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）中，由于状态不可完全观测，传统基于模型或完整状态信息的策略优化方法难以适用，亟需一种无需完整状态知识、计算高效且理论可保证的梯度估计方法。

Method: 提出GPOMDP算法，一种类似REINFORCE的无模型梯度估计方法，通过单条轨迹估计平均奖励关于随机策略参数的梯度；引入衰减因子β∈[0,1)平衡偏差与方差；结合共轭梯度法进行策略参数优化。

Result: GPOMDP算法被证明具有收敛性；实验与理论表明其梯度估计有效，且能成功用于共轭梯度优化以找到平均奖励的局部最优策略。

Conclusion: GPOMDP是一种适用于POMDP的实用、高效、理论可靠的策略梯度方法，显著降低了对系统先验知识（如状态可观测性、模型结构）的依赖，为部分可观测环境下的强化学习提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper discusses theoretical and experimental aspects of gradient-based approaches to the direct optimization of policy performance in controlled POMDPs. We introduce GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm for estimating an approximation to the gradient of the average reward as a function of the parameters of a stochastic policy. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, it uses only one free parameter $β\in [0,1)$, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, and it requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP and show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used in a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.

Finally, we run a simulation study on a dynamic portfolio selection problem and illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向计算密集型Transformer的端到端稀疏加速器ESACT，其核心是基于局部相似性的稀疏性预测机制（SPLS），利用HLog量化在QK生成前预测局部注意力稀疏性，实现跨所有组件的高效稀疏。通过三种硬件架构创新，ESACT在26个基准测试中将总计算量减少52.03%（精度损失<1%），能量效率达3.29 TOPS/W，在注意力层能效上分别超越SpAtten和Sanger 2.95倍和2.26倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer加速器大多仅利用注意力机制中的行内稀疏性，少数利用行间稀疏性的方法依赖高成本的全局相似性估计，削弱了稀疏带来的加速优势，且通常只对部分组件稀疏。本文旨在通过低开销的局部相似性分析，实现覆盖整个Transformer的高效端到端稀疏加速。

Method: 通过分析注意力分布与计算流程，发现局部相似性可用于预测稀疏模式。提出SPLS机制，采用HLog量化在QK生成前预测局部注意力稀疏；设计三种硬件架构创新以支持高效实现，包括稀疏预测单元、动态调度机制与存储优化结构，从而在所有Transformer组件中实现稀疏计算。

Conclusion: ESACT通过利用局部相似性实现高效的端到端稀疏加速，显著降低Transformer的计算与能耗开销，为计算密集型模型的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs,
  have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance.
  However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment.
  Sparsity offers a promising solution,
  yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention,
  while few consider inter-row sparsity.
  Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation,
  which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity,
  and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components.
  Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow,
  we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead.
  Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT,
  an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers.
  ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism,
  which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation,
  achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components.
  To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations.
  Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that
  SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss.
  ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W,
  and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over
  SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效缓解路侧停车对交通流的影响，具备良好的可扩展性，适用于大规模道路网络中的动态停车管理。

Abstract: With increased travelling needs more than ever, traffic congestion has become a major concern in most urban areas. Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模神经模型训练中采用多种数据中心策略，但部分策略（如自生成合成数据）效果不佳，亟需从理论层面理解不同数据整理方法对模型性能的影响机制。

Method: 将数据整理建模为采样分布的重加权，分析其对数据诱导算子本征结构（特别是谱尾指数）的影响；分别推导静态剪枝与时间依赖性数据整理下的理论性质。

Result: 静态剪枝仅导致有界算子，不能改变谱尾指数，因而无法影响渐近神经缩放律；理想的时间依赖性数据整理（如跟踪谱残差并重归一化尾部）可理论上加速学习，但实际系统只能近似实现。

Conclusion: 数据整理的效果本质上受限于其能否调控数据算子的谱尾特性；静态方法存在根本性局限，而动态、自适应策略更具理论潜力，但需设计可行近似机制。

Abstract: Large-scale neural models are increasingly trained with data pruning, synthetic data generation, cross-model distillation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and difficulty-based sampling. While several of these data-centric strategies reliably improve training efficiency and downstream performance, others fail to provide meaningful gains -- most notably self-generated synthetic data, which often increases dataset volume without enhancing model capability.
  We formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and map its effect onto the eigenstructure of the data-induced operator. Our first main result shows that \textbf{static pruning induces a bounded operator and therefore cannot change the spectral tail exponent}; it provides at most finite-region improvements and cannot alter asymptotic neural scaling. Our second result analyzes \textbf{time-dependent data curation}, showing that an ideal oracle capable of tracking spectral residuals and continuously re-normalizing the tail can provably accelerate learning -- although practical systems can only approximate this behavior.

Conclusion: 同时建模动力学对齐与价值对齐是提升跨域离线强化学习性能的关键，DVDF为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning aims to train an agent deployed in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \textbf{\underline{D}}ynamics- and \textbf{\underline{V}}alue-aligned \textbf{\underline{D}}ata \textbf{\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines and delivers exceptional performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在长上下文提示下的评估，而忽略了代理设置下的能力和安全性问题，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过测试具有长上下文窗口（1M-2M tokens）的LLM代理在不同长度、类型和位置上下文下的任务表现与拒绝率变化，分析其能力与安全行为。

Result: 模型在100K tokens时即出现超过50%的性能下降；拒绝率变化不一致，如GPT-4.1-nano从~5%升至~40%，而Grok 4 Fast从~80%降至~10%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在长上下文任务中存在潜在安全问题，且现有评估指标和范式需重新审视，特别是在多步长任务中的安全与能力评估。

Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

Abstract: In the face of accelerating global urbanization and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, highresolution urban rainfall monitoring is crucial for building resilient smart cities. Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.

Conclusion: 实现跨域离线RL中训练与测试双重鲁棒性是可行且必要的，DROCO为该方向提供了有效框架与实用解决方案。

Abstract: Single-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from limited data coverage, while cross-domain offline RL handles this issue by leveraging additional data from other domains with dynamics shifts. However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{RO}bust \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.

Abstract: Differentiable optimization layers enable learning systems to make decisions by solving embedded optimization problems. However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\tilde{\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\tilde{\oo}(δ^{-1}ε^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we release an open-source Python library that can be easily adapted from existing solvers. Our code is available here: https://github.com/guaguakai/FFOLayer.

Abstract: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在规模化部署时推理成本高昂，而微调或人工提示工程又带来开发负担，亟需一种兼顾低成本与高开发效率的解决方案。

Method: 提出'in-context distillation'：在每个智能体步骤中动态检索教师示范作为上下文示例供学生模型模仿；结合'self-consistency cascades'实现对学生输出的自适应置信度判断。

Result: 在ALFWorld上以2.5倍更低成本达到教师级准确率（单次推理成本从\$0.059降至\$0.024），843次后即回本；在AppWorld上实现同等精度下2倍成本降低。

Conclusion: 该方法在不牺牲开发敏捷性的前提下显著降低LLM智能体运营成本，拓展了其实际应用的经济可行性。

Abstract: The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs. However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\textbf{2.5$\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \$0.059 to \$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\textbf{2$\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.

Conclusion: 将特征超参数嵌入CP分解结构并联合优化是高效且有效的策略，为核方法的大规模应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose CUDA-L2, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels. Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\it torch.matmul} to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\% over {\it torch.matmul} on average; +19.2\% over {\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\% over {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\% over the most competitive {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\%, +26.0\%, +22.4\%, and +15.9\% for {\it torch.matmul}, {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

Conclusion: 解耦优化与生成是一种兼顾策略稳定性与表达能力的有效路径，为复杂控制任务中的强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces a persistent tension: policies that are stable to optimize are often too simple to represent the multimodal action distributions needed for complex control. Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive.

Conclusion: 物理引导的Transformer架构可统一支撑界面主导热系统的正向建模与逆向参数识别，为高保真、高鲁棒性热仿真提供新范式。

Abstract: Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.

Abstract: Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.

Conclusion: SeeNav-Agent通过改进输入表示与强化学习策略，有效缓解VLN中多类错误，显著提升导航性能，为LVLM驱动的具身导航提供了新范式。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from perception errors, reasoning errors, and planning errors, which significantly hinder their navigation performance. To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.

Conclusion: OptPO通过结合统计最优停止与测试时学习，提供了一种高效的测试时自适应新范式。

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

Conclusion: F2D2解决了流模型中长期存在的似然计算效率瓶颈，兼具高效采样与精确似然评估能力。

Abstract: Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应加权最小二乘支持向量机（AW-LSSVM），通过迭代全局耦合机制促进多视图间的互补学习，使各视图关注其他视图在前一轮中难以分类的样本，在保持原始特征隔离的同时提升多视图学习性能，并适用于隐私保护场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核方法多视图学习缺乏显式的跨视图协作机制或协同正则化，限制了全局协作能力。

Method: 提出AW-LSSVM，采用迭代全局耦合策略，使每个视图动态关注其他视图此前迭代中的难样本，实现互补学习；保持各视图原始特征隔离。

Result: 在多数数据集上优于现有核方法，且具备隐私保护优势。

Conclusion: AW-LSSVM通过自适应加权与迭代耦合增强了多视图互补性与全局协作，在性能与隐私保护之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Multi-view learning integrates diverse representations of the same instances to improve performance. Most existing kernel-based multi-view learning methods use fusion techniques without enforcing an explicit collaboration type across views or co-regularization which limits global collaboration. We propose AW-LSSVM, an adaptive weighted LS-SVM that promotes complementary learning by an iterative global coupling to make each view focus on hard samples of others from previous iterations. Experiments demonstrate that AW-LSSVM outperforms existing kernel-based multi-view methods on most datasets, while keeping raw features isolated, making it also suitable for privacy-preserving scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成式蒸馏的持续性机器遗忘框架，以应对视觉生成模型在连续删除请求下的稳定性危机，显著提升了目标概念遗忘的保真度，同时最小化对保留概念和生成质量的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法无法有效应对现实场景中逐次到来的删除请求（即持续性遗忘），导致模型性能级联退化，难以满足GDPR等数据隐私法规要求。

Method: 提出一种生成式蒸馏驱动的持续性遗忘框架，将每次遗忘步骤建模为多目标师生蒸馏过程，并融合持续学习原理来维持模型完整性。

Result: 在10步序列基准测试中，该方法在遗忘目标概念时保真度更高，且对保留概念性能和图像生成质量干扰极小，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模生成模型提供了可落地的持续性遗忘解决方案，支持产业界高效合规地响应动态数据删除请求。

Abstract: The recent rapid growth of visual generative models trained on vast web-scale datasets has created significant tension with data privacy regulations and copyright laws, such as GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten.'' This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.

TL;DR: 本文提出Graph VQ-Transformer（GVT），一种两阶段分子生成框架：先用图向量量化变分自编码器（VQ-VAE）将分子图压缩为高质量离散潜序列，再用自回归Transformer建模该序列；显著提升生成精度与效率，并在多个基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型计算开销大，自回归模型易受误差传播影响，亟需兼顾高精度与高效率的新型分子生成方法。

Method: 提出Graph VQ-Transformer（GVT）：第一阶段是结合RCM节点排序和RoPE的图VQ-VAE，实现高保真离散潜表示；第二阶段是基于该离散潜序列训练的自回归Transformer，将图生成转化为序列建模问题。

Abstract: The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.

Result: 在计算机视觉和图数据集上验证了方法有效性，相比现有最先进CP方法，效率最高提升34.4%（给定熵阈值下）

Conclusion: 效率与预测熵之间存在权衡关系；熵约束的共形校正能更优地平衡二者，提升CP实用性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a comprehensive framework to produce statistically rigorous uncertainty sets for black-box machine learning models. To further improve the efficiency of CP, conformal correction is proposed to fine-tune or wrap the base model with an extra module using a conformal-aware inefficiency loss. In this work, we empirically and theoretically identify a trade-off between the CP efficiency and the entropy of model prediction. We then propose an entropy-constrained conformal correction method, exploring a better Pareto optimum between efficiency and entropy. Extensive experimental results on both computer vision and graph datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. For instance, it can significantly improve the efficiency of state-of-the-art CP methods by up to 34.4%, given an entropy threshold.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个可信图神经网络（CGNNs），将可信学习扩展到图域，通过训练GNN输出可信集形式的集合值预测，以提升不确定性量化能力，尤其在异质图和分布偏移场景下表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNNs）的不确定性量化方法主要依赖贝叶斯推断或集成方法，缺乏对图结构特性和消息传递机制适配的可靠不确定性建模框架；尤其在分布外（out-of-distribution）和异质图场景下，不确定性估计常不可靠。

Method: 提出可信图神经网络（CGNNs），将可信学习（credal learning）引入图域，使GNN输出可信集（credal sets）而非单点预测；针对GNN消息传递特性，设计了层间信息传播互补的可信学习策略。

Result: 在节点分类的分布外不确定性量化任务上，CGNNs显著提升了认知不确定性（epistemic uncertainty）表征的可靠性，并在异质图的分布偏移场景下达到当前最优性能。

Conclusion: 图结构中的同质性假设（homophily）对不确定性估计效果具有关键影响；CGNNs为图学习提供了更鲁棒、可解释的不确定性量化新范式，尤其适用于现实世界中普遍存在的异质图。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for deploying reliable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where existing approaches primarily rely on Bayesian inference or ensembles. In this paper, we introduce the first credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), which extend credal learning to the graph domain by training GNNs to output set-valued predictions in the form of credal sets. To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNNs deliver more reliable representations of epistemic uncertainty and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift on heterophilic graphs.

Result: 该方法实现了与标准变分自编码器和Wasserstein自编码器相当的分布匹配效果，并可推广到其他潜在分布。

Conclusion: 对抗性干扰可作为一种有效的正则化工具用于潜在空间分布匹配，为生成模型提供了一种新的优化思路。

Abstract: We propose the use of adversarial wireless jamming to regularise the latent space of an autoencoder to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions.

Motivation: 现有针对大语言模型的数据污染检测方法在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）上效果不佳，主要受限于多模态组件适配带来的不稳定性及多输入间的分布偏移。

Method: 提出FiMMIA——一个模块化的多模态成员推断攻击框架；通过识别现有数据集中的分布偏移，构建扩展基线流程；将基于扰动的成员推断方法泛化至MLLMs，训练神经网络分析目标模型在扰动输入下的行为以区分成员与非成员。

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific data point was included in the training set of a target model. Although there are have been numerous methods developed for detecting data contamination in large language models (LLMs), their performance on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) falls short due to the instabilities introduced through multimodal component adaptation and possible distribution shifts across multiple inputs. In this work, we investigate multimodal membership inference and address two issues: first, by identifying distribution shifts in the existing datasets, and second, by releasing an extended baseline pipeline to detect them. We also generalize the perturbation-based membership inference methods to MLLMs and release \textbf{FiMMIA} -- a modular \textbf{F}ramework for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{MIA}.\footnote{The source code and framework have been made publicly available under the MIT license via \href{https://github.com/ai-forever/data_leakage_detect}{link}.The video demonstration is available on \href{https://youtu.be/a9L4-H80aSg}{YouTube}.} Our approach trains a neural network to analyze the target model's behavior on perturbed inputs, capturing distributional differences between members and non-members. Comprehensive evaluations on various fine-tuned multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of our perturbation-based membership inference attacks in multimodal domains.

Conclusion: 流匹配目标天然具备两阶段学习特性，该发现为理解扩散模型训练动态提供了新视角，并可指导未来架构与算法的设计改进。

Abstract: Flow-based diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for training generative models across images and videos. However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.

Motivation: 时间序列数据跨领域和通道存在显著尺度差异与非平稳性，而现有TSFM中归一化方法被忽视，影响泛化能力。

Method: 对四种架构各异的TSFM进行系统评估，比较包括REVIN在内的多种归一化方法。

Result: REVIN将零样本MASE相对未归一化基线降低89%，相对其他归一化方法降低44%，且无需数据集级预处理即达最优域内精度（0.84 MASE）。

Conclusion: REVIN是当前TSFM中最高效归一化方法，但其效果受模型架构与优化目标（如损失尺度敏感性、模型类型）影响。

Abstract: We investigate input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).

Motivation: 现有去中心化联邦学习（DFL）方法在面对异常客户端（如噪声或投毒数据）时鲁棒性差，且常依赖大量正常邻居或可靠客户端的先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出自适应DFL（aDFL），根据客户端行为动态调整其学习率：对可疑客户端赋予较小学习率，对正常客户端赋予较大学习率，实现完全自适应的异常抑制。

Result: 理论分析表明aDFL无需对邻居节点施加严格条件、不依赖先验知识，并具备oracle性质；大量实验验证其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: aDFL是一种实用、鲁棒且理论上可保证的去中心化联邦学习新范式，显著提升了异常环境下的模型训练稳定性与有效性。

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (DFL), the presence of abnormal clients, often caused by noisy or poisoned data, can significantly disrupt the learning process and degrade the overall robustness of the model. Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the aDFL method.

Abstract: Outer loop tasks such as optimization, uncertainty quantification or inference can easily become intractable when the underlying high-fidelity model is computationally expensive. Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple sources of information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实值大模型量化受限于低比特表示能力；复数值模型（如iFairy）虽具优势但需从头训练，无法利用海量预训练实值模型权重。

Method: 1）建立实值与广义线性复数映射的数学等价性证明；2）将标准Transformer层转换至复数域；3）采用第四根单位根（±1, ±j）作为码本的相位感知量化；4）引入递归残差量化以迭代减小误差，并支持乘法-free累加推理。

Result: 在LLaMA-2 7B上实现有效2比特量化，性能接近全精度基线，显著超越当前最优实值二值/三值量化方法。

Conclusion: Fairy2i成功弥合了复数表示高效性与预训练模型实用性的鸿沟，为通用硬件上的高效大模型推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.

Conclusion: 本文成功建立了针对广义Thurstone模型的极小极大假设检验框架，提供了理论保证并在合成与真实数据上验证了方法的实用性。

Abstract: In this work, we develop a hypothesis testing framework to determine whether pairwise comparison data is generated by an underlying \emph{generalized Thurstone model} $\mathcal{T}_F$ for a given choice function $F$. While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods. Finally, we validate our results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 融合卫星图像与道路网络等多模态信息可显著提升交通事故预测性能，并支持更可靠的因果归因分析，为智能交通治理提供新范式。

Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of how to speed up computation for Gaussian process models trained on autocorrelated data. The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.

*Jennifer Zvonek,Andrew Gillette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出PruningAMR算法，通过权矩阵插值分解剪枝来识别隐式神经表示（INR）中的几何特征，并指导自适应网格细化，实现无需原始训练数据的高效可变分辨率可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示（INR）虽比传统栅格数据更省内存，但许多可视化任务仍需离散化为规则网格；现有方法缺乏对INR内在几何特征的自适应利用。

Method: 提出PruningAMR算法：首先对预训练INR的权重矩阵采用插值分解进行剪枝，提取几何特征；再以剪枝后网络为指导，驱动自适应网格细化（AMR），生成与函数局部分辨率匹配的非均匀网格。

Result: 在无需访问原始训练数据的前提下，从预训练INR出发，成功生成变量分辨率的可视化网格，显著节省内存。

Conclusion: PruningAMR实现了对INR几何结构的无数据依赖感知与自适应离散化，为基于INR的高效可视化提供了新范式。

Abstract: An implicit neural representation (INR) is a neural network that approximates a spatiotemporal function. Many memory-intensive visualization tasks, including modern 4D CT scanning methods, represent data natively as INRs. While INRs are prized for being more memory-efficient than traditional data stored on a lattice, many visualization tasks still require discretization to a regular grid. We present PruningAMR, an algorithm that builds a mesh with resolution adapted to geometric features encoded by the INR. To identify these geometric features, we use an interpolative decomposition pruning method on the weight matrices of the INR. The resulting pruned network is used to guide adaptive mesh refinement, enabling automatic mesh generation tailored to the underlying resolution of the function. Starting from a pre-trained INR--without access to its training data--we produce a variable resolution visualization with substantial memory savings.

Conclusion: 基于原型的学习方法有助于揭示TME中可解释的空间生物标志物，在空间组学机制发现中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to advance precision oncology. We present ProteinPNet, a novel framework based on prototypical part networks that discovers TME motifs from spatial proteomics data. Unlike traditional post-hoc explanability models, ProteinPNet directly learns discriminative, interpretable, faithful spatial prototypes through supervised training. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets with ground truth motifs, and further test it on a real-world lung cancer spatial proteomics dataset. ProteinPNet consistently identifies biologically meaningful prototypes aligned with different tumor subtypes. Through graphical and morphological analyses, we show that these prototypes capture interpretable features pointing to differences in immune infiltration and tissue modularity. Our results highlight the potential of prototype-based learning to reveal interpretable spatial biomarkers within the TME, with implications for mechanistic discovery in spatial omics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Bradley-Terry-Davidson模型的分布校准聚合方法，用于提升大语言模型作为评判者时的可靠性，通过建模三向偏好、利用极性与决断力，在多个基准上优于标准基线，并达到或超过单个人类评分员水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM作为评判者在单样本层面噪声大，且常用聚合规则（如多数投票、软自一致性等）在允许平局时表现不一致。

Method: 提出一种基于Bradley-Terry-Davidson模型的分布校准聚合方案，对每个项目生成n个独立的推理-评分样本，同时建模偏好极性（非平局间的边际）和决断力（非平局率）。

Result: 在多个评估基准上，该方法持续降低MAE、提升成对准确率；对比人类共识元标签时，性能匹配或超越单个人类评分员。

Conclusion: 合理分配推理时计算资源（ITC）并采用分布感知的聚合方法，可将嘈杂的单次模型判断转化为可靠的评估评分。

Abstract: Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) used as judges for pairwise preferences remain noisy at the single-sample level, and common aggregation rules (majority vote, soft self-consistency, or instruction-based self-aggregation) are inconsistent when ties are allowed. We study inference-time compute (ITC) for evaluators that generate n independent thinking-rating samples per item, and propose a principled, distribution-calibrated aggregation scheme. Our method models three-way preferences with a Bradley-Terry-Davidson formulation on rating counts, leveraging both polarity (margin among non-ties) and decisiveness (non-tie rate) to distinguish narrow margins from strong consensus. Across various evaluation benchmarks, our approach consistently reduces MAE and increases pairwise accuracy versus standard baselines, and when evaluated against human-consensus meta-labels, matches or exceeds individual human raters. These results show that carefully allocating ITC and aggregating with distribution-aware methods turns noisy individual model judgments into reliable ratings for evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏对LLM推理功耗的系统性测量与分析能力，而推理占LLM服务总能耗超90%，亟需专用功耗评估工具。

Method: 设计了TokenPowerBench基准，包含：(i)声明式配置接口（支持模型、提示集、推理引擎选择）；(ii)无需专用电表的多层级（GPU/节点/系统）功耗测量层；(iii)相位对齐的指标流水线，将能耗精确归因至每个请求的prefill和decode阶段。

Result: 在Llama、Falcon、Qwen、Mistral四大主流模型系列（参数量从1B至405B）上完成验证，支持批量大小、上下文长度、并行策略、量化等变量对'焦耳/词元'等能效指标的影响分析。

Conclusion: TokenPowerBench填补了LLM推理功耗评估空白，为能效优化、运营成本预测及可持续发展目标提供开源、实用的测量基础设施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) services now answer billions of queries per day, and industry reports show that inference, not training, accounts for more than 90% of total power consumption. However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model. Furthermore, we release TokenPowerBench as open source to help users to measure power consumption, forecast operating expenses, and meet sustainability targets when deploying LLM services.

Conclusion: 融合力/触觉感知的强化学习策略能有效提升机器人系统的安全性和可靠性，具有广泛的实际应用前景。

Abstract: For the task with complicated manipulation in unstructured environments, traditional hand-coded methods are ineffective, while reinforcement learning can provide more general and useful policy. Although the reinforcement learning is able to obtain impressive results, its stability and reliability is hard to guarantee, which would cause the potential safety threats. Besides, the transfer from simulation to real world also will lead in unpredictable situations. To enhance the safety and reliability of robots, we introduce the force and haptic perception into reinforcement learning. Force and tactual sensation play key roles in robotic dynamic control and human-robot interaction. We demonstrate that the force-based reinforcement learning method can be more adaptive to environment, especially in sim-to-real transfer. Experimental results show in object pushing task, our strategy is safer and more efficient in both simulation and real world, thus it holds prospects for a wide variety of robotic applications.

Motivation: 在野火等紧急响应中，通信至关重要，但极端环境可能导致无人机网络中的个体失效，从而中断通信，因此需要一种能够应对损耗并保持网络连通性的方法。

Method: 提出了Robust Task Networking Under Attrition (RTNUA)问题，并设计了Physics-Informed Robust Employment of Multi-Agent Networks (ΦIREMAN)算法，利用物理启发的势场方法实现网络的主动冗余和抗损恢复。

Result: 在25种不同配置的仿真中，ΦIREMAN consistently 优于DCCRS基线方法；在包含多达100个任务和500架无人机的大规模问题中，即使存在显著损耗，仍能维持超过99.9%的任务正常运行时间。

Conclusion: ΦIREMAN有效解决了多无人机网络在极端环境下的鲁棒性问题，具备良好的可扩展性和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Fast, efficient, robust communication during wildfire and other emergency responses is critical. One way to achieve this is by coordinating swarms of autonomous aerial vehicles carrying communications equipment to form an ad-hoc network connecting emergency response personnel to both each other and central command. However, operating in such extreme environments may lead to individual networking agents being damaged or rendered inoperable, which could bring down the network and interrupt communications.
  To overcome this challenge and enable multi-agent UAV networking in difficult environments, this paper introduces and formalizes the problem of Robust Task Networking Under Attrition (RTNUA), which extends connectivity maintenance in multi-robot systems to explicitly address proactive redundancy and attrition recovery. We introduce Physics-Informed Robust Employment of Multi-Agent Networks ($Φ$IREMAN), a topological algorithm leveraging physics-inspired potential fields to solve this problem. Through simulation across 25 problem configurations, $Φ$IREMAN consistently outperforms the DCCRS baseline, and on large-scale problems with up to 100 tasks and 500 drones, maintains $>99.9\%$ task uptime despite substantial attrition, demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability.

Abstract: We present VIGS-SLAM, a visual-inertial 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that achieves robust real-time tracking and high-fidelity reconstruction. Although recent 3DGS-based SLAM methods achieve dense and photorealistic mapping, their purely visual design degrades under motion blur, low texture, and exposure variations. Our method tightly couples visual and inertial cues within a unified optimization framework, jointly refining camera poses, depths, and IMU states. It features robust IMU initialization, time-varying bias modeling, and loop closure with consistent Gaussian updates.

Conclusion: 解耦建模与策略增强策略能有效提升世界模型在多车辆平台上的泛化能力和实际部署鲁棒性。

Abstract: World models have gained significant attention as a promising approach for autonomous driving. By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: 扩散模型可有效建模多智能体长期协同策略；AID证明了非自回归生成与在线奖励反馈结合，能在保持去中心化的同时显著提升MAIPP性能与可扩展性。

Abstract: Information gathering in large-scale or time-critical scenarios (e.g., environmental monitoring, search and rescue) requires broad coverage within limited time budgets, motivating the use of multi-agent systems. These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as "intent" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/marmotlab/AID.

Abstract: As robots become more adaptable, responsive, and capable of interacting with humans, the design of effective human-robot collaboration becomes critical. Yet, this design process is typically led by monodisciplinary approaches, often overlooking interdisciplinary knowledge and the experiential knowledge of workers who will ultimately share tasks with these systems. To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects. The framework emerges as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and a boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, guiding designers, empowering workers, and contributing to more just and collaborative futures of work.

TL;DR: 本文提出SAM2Grasp，一种基于冻结SAM2模型和轻量动作头的模仿学习框架，通过引入提示条件化和时序跟踪解决多目标抓取中的多模态问题，在复杂场景中实现单模态、无歧义的抓取轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在包含多个有效目标的场景中，传统模仿学习因不同物体抓取示范产生冲突训练信号而导致性能下降，即多模态问题。

Method: 利用冻结的SAM2模型强大的视觉时序跟踪能力，构建一个与原分割头并行的可训练轻量动作头；训练时仅更新动作头，使用SAM2预计算的时序视觉特征；推理时通过初始提示（如边界框）指定目标物体，由提示条件化动作头预测唯一抓取轨迹，并依赖SAM2的内置跟踪能力持续追踪目标。

Result: 在多物体密集场景下的抓取任务中，SAM2Grasp实现了最先进的性能，有效消除视觉运动策略中的歧义。

Conclusion: SAM2Grasp通过将抓取任务重构为单模态、提示条件化的预测问题，结合SAM2的时序跟踪能力，成功解决了多目标场景下的多模态冲突问题，提升了模仿学习在机器人抓取中的表现。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic grasping is often plagued by the multimodal problem: when a scene contains multiple valid targets, demonstrations of grasping different objects create conflicting training signals. Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Robowheel，一个从单目RGB或RGB-D视频中提取人类手物交互（HOI）并生成适用于跨形态机器人学习的训练数据引擎，通过高精度重建和强化学习优化实现物理合理的动作重定向，并在仿真中进行数据增强，验证了HOI作为机器人学习监督信号的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器人学习依赖于昂贵且受限的遥操作数据，缺乏通用性和可扩展性，本文旨在利用广泛存在的HOI视频作为低成本、可扩展的监督来源，实现跨机器人形态的通用动作学习。

Method: 提出Robowheel数据引擎：首先对单目视频进行高精度HOI重建，使用强化学习优化器在接触和穿透约束下精调手物相对位姿；然后将重建的轨迹重定向至不同机器人形态（如机械臂、灵巧手、人形机器人）；最后在Isaac Sim中构建仿真增强框架，引入多样化的域随机化以扩大数据覆盖范围。

Result: 构建了端到端的数据 pipeline，生成了物理合理且接触丰富的轨迹；在主流视觉语言动作（VLA）和模仿学习模型上验证，表明生成的轨迹稳定性与遥操作相当，并带来持续性能提升；发布了大规模多模态数据集，融合多视角、单目视频和公开HOI语料库。

Conclusion: Robowheel首次提供了定量证据，证明HOI模态可作为有效的机器人学习监督信号；相比遥操作更轻量、通用，仅需单目相机即可生成可跨形态迁移的动作表示，推动了基于视觉的通用具身智能发展。

Abstract: We introduce Robowheel, a data engine that converts human hand object interaction (HOI) videos into training-ready supervision for cross morphology robotic learning. From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法难以捕捉罕见但安全关键的行为，而基于规则的系统在复杂交互中缺乏适应性。

Method: CogDrive包含预测模块和规划模块：预测模块采用基于拓扑运动语义和最近邻关系编码的认知交互模式表征，并结合可微模态损失与多模态高斯解码；规划模块引入应急响应概念，优化安全稳定的轨迹，兼顾短期一致性与长期平滑无碰撞运动。

Conclusion: CogDrive通过融合认知多模态预测与面向安全的规划，为复杂交通环境下的安全自主驾驶提供了可解释、可靠的范式。

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving in mixed traffic requires a unified understanding of multimodal interactions and dynamic planning under uncertainty. Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions. To address these limitations, CogDrive introduces a cognition driven multimodal prediction and planning framework that integrates explicit modal reasoning with safety aware trajectory optimization. The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios. By combining cognitive multimodal prediction with safety oriented planning, CogDrive offers an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation, yet they remain limited in failure diagnosis and learning from failures. Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LangGraph的LLM驱动任务分配框架LTAA，通过相位自适应策略、多阶段验证与动态提示，在建筑自动化多机器人任务分配中显著提升效率与可解释性，并在TEACh数据集上系统性超越传统优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在建筑机器人任务分配中缺乏严格验证和与传统算法的基准对比，且面临实现挑战。

Method: 提出LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent（LTAA），融合相位自适应分配、分层重试的多阶段验证、动态提示机制，并采用Self-Corrective Agent Architecture解决实现问题；基于SMART-LLM复现验证可行性。

Result: LTAA在Heavy Excels场景下任务完成率达77%，优于DP、Q-learning和DQN；token用量减少94.6%，分配时间缩短86%；具备更好工作负载均衡性、可解释性与无需重训练的任务逻辑更新能力。

Conclusion: LLM结合结构化验证可在多机器人建筑任务分配中媲美甚至超越传统优化算法，同时提供可解释性、适应性和灵活性等额外优势。

Abstract: Multi-robot task allocation in construction automation has traditionally relied on optimization methods such as Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在微调后存在推理时噪声采样不稳定问题，源于VLA策略与下游任务成功动作模式之间的分布偏移。

Method: 提出TACO框架，采用轻量级伪计数估计器作为动作片段的高保真验证器，在推理时选择伪计数最高的动作，且不依赖梯度更新。

Result: 在四个仿真基准（RoboTwin2.0、Robotwin、LIBERO、SimplerEnv）及双臂平台实验中，显著提升了推理稳定性和任务成功率。

Conclusion: TACO是一种高效、无梯度、仅在推理阶段施加约束的方法，有效缓解分布偏移，兼顾稳定性与泛化性，为VLA下游适配提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations.

Conclusion: 融合VLM与自适应引导扩散模型的分层框架，有效解决了自动驾驶系统测试中安全关键场景稀疏与生成可控性不足的问题，为ADS评估提供了新范式。

Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) relies on comprehensive testing and evaluation. However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VLM的视觉可通行性估计方法依赖手工提示、跨实体泛化能力差，且仅输出可通行图，需外部规划器生成轨迹，效率低且扩展性差。

Method: 提出SwarmDiffusion，采用端到端扩散模型，结合VLM监督但无需提示工程；通过随机路点采样、贝塞尔平滑和正则化构建无规划器的轨迹生成 pipeline，并以紧凑的实体状态为条件，学习稳定的运动先验。

Result: 在室内环境和两种实体（四足、空中）上达到80-100%导航成功率，推理时间0.09秒；仅用500个额外视觉样本即可适应新机器人；在仿真和真实场景中均表现出对未见环境的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: SwarmDiffusion提供了一种可扩展、无需提示的统一可通行性推理与轨迹生成方法，具备跨平台迁移能力，显著提升自主导航的效率与实用性。

Abstract: Visual traversability estimation is critical for autonomous navigation, but existing VLM-based methods rely on hand-crafted prompts, generalize poorly across embodiments, and output only traversability maps, leaving trajectory generation to slow external planners. We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100\% navigation success and 0.09 s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在分布内表现良好，但在新相机视角和视觉扰动下性能急剧下降，本文旨在解决其空间建模不一致导致的脆弱性问题。

Method: 提出两种轻量级单次适配方法：Feature Token Modulation（FTM），对视觉token施加全局仿射变换；以及Feature Linear Adaptation（FLA），在ViT编码器中引入低秩更新。

Result: FTM将Libero视角准确率从48.5%提升至87.1%，仅需4K参数；FLA进一步提升至90.8%，参数量为4.7M，性能媲美LoRA微调但成本更低。

Conclusion: 预训练VLA模型具有未被充分挖掘的鲁棒性，仅需针对视觉表征进行少量、精准的适配，即可有效恢复其视角泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong in-distribution performance but degrade sharply under novel camera viewpoints and visual perturbations. We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.

Conclusion: 该工作首次系统性地实现了连杆驱动机器人手指的高精度任务空间轨迹跟踪，为未来面向灵巧操作的机器人手指设计提供了基准参考。

Abstract: Task-space control of robotic fingers is a critical enabler of dexterous manipulation, as manipulation objectives are most naturally specified in terms of fingertip motions and applied forces rather than individual joint angles. While task-space planning and control have been extensively studied for larger, arm-scale manipulators, demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in compact, multi-DoF robotic fingers remain scarce. In this paper, we present the physical prototyping and experimental characterization of a three-degree-of-freedom, linkage-driven, series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and a closed-form Jacobian. A resolved motion rate control (RMRC) scheme is implemented to achieve closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking. We experimentally evaluate the fingertip tracking performance across a variety of trajectories, including straight lines, circles, and more complex curves, and report millimeter-level accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides one of the first systematic experimental demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in a linkage-driven robotic finger, thereby establishing a benchmark for future designs aimed at dexterous in-hand manipulation.

Conclusion: 显式建模并利用VDM中的运动感知表征可显著提升机器人策略的物理一致性、鲁棒性与实时性，异步双系统设计有效缓解了推理效率瓶颈。

Abstract: Robust perception and dynamics modeling are fundamental to real-world robotic policy learning. Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: Q-Bert4Rec 是一种面向多模态序列推荐的新型框架，通过跨模态语义注入、语义量化和多掩码预训练，将文本、图像等语义信息融入序列建模，显著提升推荐性能与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的序列推荐方法（如BERT4Rec）仅依赖离散物品ID，缺乏语义含义且忽略文本、图像等多模态信息，导致泛化能力弱、可解释性差。

Method: 提出Q-Bert4Rec框架，包含三阶段：(1) 跨模态语义注入——用动态Transformer融合文本、视觉和结构特征来增强ID嵌入；(2) 语义量化——采用残差向量量化将融合表征离散为有意义的语义token；(3) 多掩码预训练与微调——结合span、tail和multi-region掩码策略提升序列理解能力。

Result: 在Amazon公开数据集上显著优于多个强基线模型，验证了语义token化对多模态序列推荐的有效性。

Conclusion: 引入语义感知的量化token机制可有效弥合ID建模与多模态语义之间的鸿沟，提升序列推荐的性能、泛化性与可解释性。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation plays a critical role in modern online platforms such as e-commerce, advertising, and content streaming, where accurately predicting users' next interactions is essential for personalization. Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation. Our source code will be publicly available on GitHub after publishing.

Method: 提出Local Life Information Accessibility（LLIA）问题，并设计AskNearby系统：包含三层RAG管道（图结构、语义向量、地理检索融合）和用户认知地图模型（建模邻里熟悉度与偏好）。

Result: 在真实社区数据集上，AskNearby在检索准确率与推荐质量上显著优于大语言模型和地图基线方法，在时空定位与认知感知排序方面表现稳健；实地部署验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: AskNearby通过解决LLIA问题，有效赋能居民发现本地资源、规划日常活动并增强社区参与，为15分钟城市建设提供了可行的信息技术支撑。

Abstract: The "15-minute city" envisions neighborhoods where residents can meet daily needs via a short walk or bike ride. Realizing this vision requires not only physical proximity but also efficient and reliable access to information about nearby places, services, and events. Existing location-based systems, however, focus mainly on city-level tasks and neglect the spatial, temporal, and cognitive factors that shape localized decision-making. We conceptualize this gap as the Local Life Information Accessibility (LLIA) problem and introduce AskNearby, an AI-driven community application that unifies retrieval and recommendation within the 15-minute life circle. AskNearby integrates (i) a three-layer Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that synergizes graph-based, semantic-vector, and geographic retrieval with (ii) a cognitive-map model that encodes each user's neighborhood familiarity and preferences. Experiments on real-world community datasets demonstrate that AskNearby significantly outperforms LLM-based and map-based baselines in retrieval accuracy and recommendation quality, achieving robust performance in spatiotemporal grounding and cognitive-aware ranking. Real-world deployments further validate its effectiveness. By addressing the LLIA challenge, AskNearby empowers residents to more effectively discover local resources, plan daily activities, and engage in community life.

*Chenji Lu,Zhuo Chen,Hui Zhao,Zhiyuan Zeng,Gang Zhao,Junjie Ren,Ruicong Xu,Haoran Li,Songyan Liu,Pengjie Wang,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了LORE框架，通过将相关性任务分解为知识与推理、多模态匹配和规则遵循三个核心能力，并采用两阶段训练范式、RAIR基准测试及分层部署策略，在电商搜索中实现了27%的GoodRate提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于链式思维（CoT）的方法在相关性建模中遭遇性能瓶颈，主因是将相关性视为单一整体任务，缺乏对其内在能力的系统性解构。

Method: 提出LORE框架：1）两阶段训练（SFT进行渐进式CoT合成 + RL进行人类偏好对齐）；2）构建RAIR基准评估三大核心能力；3）采用查询频率分层的部署策略实现离线能力向线上系统高效迁移。

Result: LORE在电商搜索中实现累计+27%的在线GoodRate指标提升，并经过三年实际部署迭代验证。

Conclusion: 相关性应被定性分解为多个可评估、可优化的核心能力；LORE不仅提供了LLM相关性建模的完整生命周期蓝图，也为其他垂直领域提供了方法论参考。

Abstract: Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.

### [261] [CoatFusion: Controllable Material Coating in Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02143)
*Sagie Levy,Elad Aharoni,Matan Levy,Ariel Shamir,Dani Lischinski*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了材料涂层（Material Coating）这一新型图像编辑任务，旨在模拟在物体表面施加一层薄材料而不破坏其几何结构，并构建了大规模合成数据集DataCoat110K，提出CoatFusion模型，结合2D反照率纹理与PBR参数（如粗糙度、金属度、透射率和厚度）控制扩散模型，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有材料迁移方法通常覆盖物体固有材质及细节，无法实现真实感的薄层材料叠加；需一种能保留物体几何结构（粗粒度与细粒度）的新编辑范式。

Method: 构建包含110K张图像的合成数据集DataCoat110K（基于3D物体与物理渲染的多样化涂层）；提出CoatFusion架构，将扩散模型以2D albedo纹理和PBR参数（含关键厚度参数）为条件进行控制。

Result: CoatFusion在材料涂层任务上生成结果更真实、可控，实验与用户研究均表明其显著优于现有材料编辑与迁移方法。

Conclusion: Material Coating是一项具有实际意义的新图像编辑任务；CoatFusion及其配套数据集为该任务提供了有效解决方案，并推动了基于物理的可控图像生成发展。

Abstract: We introduce Material Coating, a novel image editing task that simulates applying a thin material layer onto an object while preserving its underlying coarse and fine geometry. Material coating is fundamentally different from existing "material transfer" methods, which are designed to replace an object's intrinsic material, often overwriting fine details. To address this new task, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (110K images) of 3D objects with varied, physically-based coatings, named DataCoat110K. We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter. Experiments and user studies show CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on this new task.

*Yuxuan Mu,Ziyu Zhang,Yi Shi,Minami Matsumoto,Kotaro Imamura,Guy Tevet,Chuan Guo,Michael Taylor,Chang Shu,Pengcheng Xi,Xue Bin Peng*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP)，利用预训练运动扩散模型和得分蒸馏采样（SDS）构建可复用、任务无关的运动先验，无需为每个新控制器重新训练，显著提升运动先验的通用性与模块化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗式运动先验需针对每个新控制器重训练，复用性差且依赖原始动作数据，限制了其在下游任务中的灵活性和实用性。

Method: 基于预训练运动扩散模型，结合得分蒸馏采样（SDS），构建冻结即可复用的Score-Matching Motion Priors（SMP），作为通用奖励函数指导策略训练，并支持风格迁移与组合合成新风格。

Result: SMP在多种物理仿真人形控制任务中生成高质量自然运动，性能媲美最先进对抗式模仿学习方法，同时支持跨风格复用与组合，无需重训练。

Conclusion: SMP提供了一种可复用、模块化、任务无关的运动先验范式，克服了传统对抗式方法的复用瓶颈，推动了数据驱动虚拟角色行为建模的通用性与可扩展性。

Abstract: Data-driven motion priors that can guide agents toward producing naturalistic behaviors play a pivotal role in creating life-like virtual characters. Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters. Video demo available at https://youtu.be/ravlZJteS20

Conclusion: 该智能体协同框架有效解耦并标准化了算法交易各环节，验证了多智能体协作在复杂金融场景中的可行性与优越性，为大众化金融AI提供了新范式。

Abstract: The financial market is a mission-critical playground for AI agents due to its temporal dynamics and low signal-to-noise ratio. Building an effective algorithmic trading system may require a professional team to develop and test over the years. In this paper, we propose an orchestration framework for financial agents, which aims to democratize financial intelligence to the general public. We map each component of the traditional algorithmic trading system to agents, including planner, orchestrator, alpha agents, risk agents, portfolio agents, backtest agents, execution agents, audit agents, and memory agent. We present two in-house trading examples. For the stock trading task (hourly data from 04/2024 to 12/2024), our approach achieved a return of $20.42\%$, a Sharpe ratio of 2.63, and a maximum drawdown of $-3.59\%$, while the S&P 500 index yielded a return of $15.97\%$. For the BTC trading task (minute data from 27/07/2025 to 13/08/2025), our approach achieved a return of $8.39\%$, a Sharpe ratio of $0.38$, and a maximum drawdown of $-2.80\%$, whereas the BTC price increased by $3.80\%$.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于区块链的去中心化多智能体系统（DMAS）架构，以解决传统集中式MAS存在的单点故障、审查风险、可扩展性差和信任问题；通过密码学与链上操作实现可信通信协议，保障交互可验证性、完整性、真实性、不可否认性和条件保密性，并通过安全与性能分析验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式多智能体系统存在单点故障、易受审查、可扩展性差及信任缺失等根本性问题，亟需一种去中心化、可信且抗审查的新架构。

Method: 提出基于区块链的去中心化智能体运行时架构，形式化定义信任感知通信协议，结合密码学原语与链上操作，保障多项安全属性，并开展理论安全分析与实证性能评估。

Result: 所提DMAS架构在安全性上满足可验证交互周期、通信完整性、真实性、不可否认性与条件保密性；性能分析表明其具备良好的可扩展性与运行效率。

Conclusion: DMAS为构建可信、可扩展、抗审查的自主多智能体系统提供了可行且坚实的架构基础，是迈向‘智能体互联网’的关键一步。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly accelerating the development of autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS), paving the way for the Internet of Agents. However, traditional centralized MAS architectures present significant challenges, including single points of failure, vulnerability to censorship, inherent scalability limitations, and critical trust issues. We propose a novel Decentralized Multi-Agent System (DMAS) architecture designed to overcome these fundamental problems by enabling trust-aware, scalable, and censorship-resistant interactions among autonomous agents. Our DMAS features a decentralized agent runtime underpinned by a blockchain-based architecture. We formalize a trust-aware communication protocol that leverages cryptographic primitives and on-chain operations to provide security properties: verifiable interaction cycles, communication integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, and conditional confidentiality, which we further substantiate through a comprehensive security analysis. Our performance analysis validates the DMAS as a scalable and efficient solution for building trustworthy multi-agent systems.

*Jinming Yang,Zimu Ji,Weiqi Luo,Gaoxi Wang,Bin Ma,Yueling Deng*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种生成式代理EZYer，旨在解决在线教育工具在课件生成、互动笔记和内容质量保证方面存在的服务不完整、性能不足和交互性弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线教育工具在课件生成、互动笔记和内容质量保障方面存在明显不足，难以满足高质量教学需求。

Method: EZYer包含教师模块、学生模块和控制器三部分：教师模块结合文本检索与深度生成技术，自动生成符合高中数学课程标准的结构化教学材料和LaTeX Beamer课件；学生模块通过教师、助教、优等生和困难学生的协同互动，由笔记员生成学术笔记；控制器则通过关键词过滤、内容评分、角色共验和动态纠错机制确保内容的学术严谨性和教学适宜性。

Result: 论文设计了内容准确性、知识覆盖度、可用性、格式正确性和视觉设计吸引力五个维度的评估指标，并由五个大语言模型分别对EZYer生成的100份Beamer课件和笔记进行评分，结果表明EZYer生成的内容质量优异。

Conclusion: EZYer在自动化课件生成、互动学习支持和内容质量控制方面表现出色，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: With the rapid development of the online education and large language model, the existing educational tools still suffer from incomplete service, insufficient performance and weak interactivity in terms of courseware generation, interactive notes and quality assurance of content. In particular, the proposed generative agent EZYer : 1) Teacher Module: Integrating the Text Corpus retrieval and in-depth generation technologies, it automatically generates structured teaching materials and LaTeX Beamer courseware in line with the high school mathematics syllabus and supports user-defined image insertion. 2) Student Module: Throughout the collaborative interaction of the four roles of Teacher, Assistant, Top Student and Struggling Student, Note Taker summarizes and generates academic notes to enhance the depth and interest of learning. 3) Controller: set up keyword filtering system, content scoring system, role co-validation system, and dynamic content correction system. This ensure academic strictness and pedagogical propriety of EZYer inputs and outputs. In order to evaluate EZYer, this paper designs five-dimensional evaluation indexes of content accuracy, knowledge coverage, usability, formatting correctness and visual design and appeal, and scores 100 Beamer and Notes generated by EZYer by five large language models, separately, and the results show that the quality of EZYer-generated content is excellent and has a good application prospect.

### [266] [Beyond Single-Agent Safety: A Taxonomy of Risks in LLM-to-LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02682)
*Piercosma Bisconti,Marcello Galisai,Federico Pierucci,Marcantonio Bracale,Matteo Prandi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文指出当前针对单个大语言模型（LLM）的安全机制无法应对多模型交互场景，提出从“模型级安全”转向“系统级安全”，并引入“涌现系统性风险边界（ESRH）”框架，分析交互结构如何导致集体失效，进而提出“InstitutionalAI”架构以实现多智能体系统内嵌式自适应监管。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制（如提示工程、微调、审核层）仅适用于单用户-单模型的静态监督场景，难以应对LLM之间递归交互构成的动态多智能体生态系统，局部合规可能引发全局失效。

Method: 提出系统级安全新范式，构建Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon（ESRH）理论框架，建立涵盖微观、中观、宏观层级的失败模式分类法，并设计InstitutionalAI架构以支持多智能体系统内的内生性监管。

Result: 揭示了多LLM交互中系统性风险的涌现机制；建立了跨尺度的风险失败分类体系；提出了具备自适应监督能力的InstitutionalAI系统架构。

Conclusion: 保障LLM生态安全需超越个体模型对齐，转向关注交互结构与系统动力学，ESRH框架和InstitutionalAI为构建可治理的多智能体AI系统提供了理论基础与工程路径。

Abstract: This paper examines why safety mechanisms designed for human-model interaction do not scale to environments where large language models (LLMs) interact with each other. Most current governance practices still rely on single-agent safety containment, prompts, fine-tuning, and moderation layers that constrain individual model behavior but leave the dynamics of multi-model interaction ungoverned. These mechanisms assume a dyadic setting: one model responding to one user under stable oversight. Yet research and industrial development are rapidly shifting toward LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, where outputs are recursively reused as inputs across chains of agents. In such systems, local compliance can aggregate into collective failure even when every model is individually aligned. We propose a conceptual transition from model-level safety to system-level safety, introducing the framework of the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) to formalize how instability arises from interaction structure rather than from isolated misbehavior. The paper contributes (i) a theoretical account of collective risk in interacting LLMs, (ii) a taxonomy connecting micro, meso, and macro-level failure modes, and (iii) a design proposal for InstitutionalAI, an architecture for embedding adaptive oversight within multi-agent systems.

*PIerre Dantas,Lucas Cordeiro,Youcheng Sun,Waldir Junior*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem，首次为大语言模型辅助形式化验证提供具终止性与收敛性保证的理论框架，并通过超9万次实验验证其预测精度，确立了可工程落地的三类操作区间与设计阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM与形式化验证工具协同方法缺乏理论基础，导致 refinement 过程不稳定（循环、发散或不收敛），难以用于安全关键场景。

Method: 将LLM与验证器交互建模为离散时间马尔可夫链，引入误差缩减概率δ作为核心参数，推导出几乎必然收敛至Verified状态的定理，并给出期望迭代次数上界E[n] ≤ 4/δ；辅以超90,000次实证检验。

Result: 理论预测与实验高度一致：所有运行均成功收敛，收敛因子C_f ≈ 1.0；据此划分出边际/实用/高性能三类操作区，并确立可靠设计阈值。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM辅助软件验证提供了首个具严格保证的理论-实证统一框架，使资源规划与性能预算可预测，支撑其在安全关键系统中的部署。

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Flowchart2Mermaid的轻量级Web系统，可将流程图图像转换为可编辑的Mermaid.js代码，并支持通过自然语言指令和交互式编辑进行混合主动优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态流程图图像难以编辑和重用，现有工具缺乏对结构化、可版本控制文本表示的支持。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型和详细系统提示，将流程图图像转换为Mermaid.js代码，并在Web界面中支持内联编辑、拖放节点插入和自然语言命令解析。

Result: 系统能生成与渲染图表同步的结构化文本表示，并引入了评估指标来衡量结构准确性、流程正确性、语法有效性和完整性。

Conclusion: Flowchart2Mermaid提供了一种高效的方法，将静态流程图转化为可编辑、可版本控制的动态表示，提升了流程图的可维护性和协作能力。

Abstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于转换器（transducer）的世界模型分解框架，通过逆向组合实现模块化建模，提升计算效率与可解释性，兼顾AI安全与实际推理需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景具有模块化交互特性，而现有高保真世界模型计算开销大，亟需兼顾效率与可解释性的建模方法。

Method: 构建面向转换器（广义POMDP）的世界模型分解框架，研究其组合的逆过程，导出作用于不同输入-输出子空间的子转换器，支持并行化与分布式推理。

Result: 实现了复杂世界模型的结构化分解，获得可并行、可解释的模块化替代方案，为AI安全所需的结构透明性与实时推理所需的计算效率提供了统一基础。

Conclusion: 模块化分解是连接AI安全性与计算效率的关键路径，该框架为构建可信、高效的世界模型提供了理论与方法支撑。

Abstract: World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

*Shubhi Asthana,Bing Zhang,Chad DeLuca,Ruchi Mahindru,Hima Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了STRIDE框架，用于系统性评估任务是否真正需要自主智能体（agentic AI），并在直接LLM调用、引导式AI助手与全自主智能体三者间做出最优选择；该框架通过任务分解、动态性归因和自省需求分析生成‘智能体适用性评分’，在30个真实任务中实现92%的模态选择准确率，并显著降低不必要的部署与资源开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型向自主目标驱动智能体演进，亟需回答‘何时真正需要智能体’这一关键问题；盲目部署智能体带来高成本、高复杂度与高风险，缺乏系统性决策依据。

Method: 提出STRIDE框架，融合结构化任务分解、动态性归因分析与自省需求评估，生成‘智能体适用性评分’，以指导在三种AI模态（直接LLM调用、引导式助手、全自主智能体）之间进行原则性选择。

Result: 在30个覆盖SRE、合规与企业自动化的真实任务上，STRIDE达到92%模态选择准确率，减少45%不必要的智能体部署，降低37%资源成本；经六个月专家验证，证实其在实际场景中能有效区分任务所需AI模态层级。

Conclusion: 智能体部署应是必要性驱动的设计决策，而非默认选项；STRIDE为AI系统工程提供了可量化、可解释的智能体适用性评估范式，推动更经济、更安全、更可控的AI落地实践。

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

### [271] [Benchmarking LLM Agents for Wealth-Management Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02230)
*Rory Milsom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了通用大语言模型（LLM）代理在财富管理任务中的准确性和经济性，构建了包含12个任务对的基准测试集，并发现代理性能瓶颈主要在于端到端工作流可靠性而非数学推理能力，且自主性水平和评估方式显著影响结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工作中数字协作工具普及，但常规流程仍常因人为错误和延迟而受损；需验证通用LLM代理能否胜任助理级财富管理任务。

Method: 扩展TheAgentCompany框架，构建金融专属环境；引入合成领域数据、增强同事模拟、开发自动任务生成流水线；设计含明确验收标准与确定性评分器的12任务对基准（覆盖检索、分析、合成/沟通），并设置高/低自主性变体。

Result: 代理在财富管理任务中表现受限于端到端工作流可靠性而非数学推理能力；自主性水平显著影响性能；现有模型评估方法存在缺陷，阻碍了有效基准测试。

Conclusion: LLM代理应用于财富管理需重点提升工作流鲁棒性与自主性适配能力，同时亟需更严谨、任务驱动的评估范式。

Abstract: Modern work relies on an assortment of digital collaboration tools, yet routine processes continue to suffer from human error and delay. To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of models have hindered benchmarking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了TradeTrap，一个用于系统性压力测试自主交易代理（包括自适应和程序化类型）的统一评估框架，旨在检验其在对抗性或故障条件下的可靠性与鲁棒性。该框架针对交易代理的四大核心组件（市场情报、策略制定、投资组合与账本管理、交易执行），在真实美股历史数据的闭环回测环境中施加可控系统级扰动，发现微小扰动即可引发严重风险行为，揭示当前代理存在系统级脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based trading agents在高风险、不可逆的金融市场中部署日益广泛，但其在对抗性或异常条件下的可靠性与鲁棒性尚未被系统评估。

Method: 提出TradeTrap统一评估框架，在闭环历史回测环境中对自主交易代理的四大核心组件施加可控系统级扰动，基于真实美股数据进行公平、可复现的鲁棒性评测。

Result: 实验证明，单个组件的微小扰动可在决策闭环中传播，导致极端持仓集中、失控风险暴露及大幅投资组合回撤，表明当前自主交易代理存在系统级脆弱性。

Conclusion: 现有基于LLM的自主交易代理在系统层面易被误导，亟需更鲁棒的设计与评估方法；TradeTrap为该领域提供了标准化压力测试工具。

Abstract: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

### [273] [DialogGuard: Multi-Agent Psychosocial Safety Evaluation of Sensitive LLM Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02282)
*Han Luo,Guy Laban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了DialogGuard，一个用于评估大语言模型（LLM）在心理健康等敏感场景中生成回复的心理社会风险的多智能体框架，涵盖隐私侵犯、歧视行为、心理操纵、心理伤害和侮辱行为五大维度，并通过多种LLM-as-a-judge机制提升检测准确性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地应用于心理健康、危机干预等情感敏感服务，但其心理社会安全性缺乏深入理解与有效评估。

Method: 提出DialogGuard多智能体评估框架，包含五个高严重性风险维度，并设计四种LLM-as-a-judge流程（单智能体评分、双智能体修正、多智能体辩论、随机多数投票），基于统一三级评分标准；在PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上验证性能，并开展面向12位从业者的形成性研究。

Result: 多智能体机制在心理社会风险检测上优于非LLM基线和单智能体判断；双智能体修正与多数投票在准确性、与人工标注一致性及鲁棒性间取得最佳平衡；多智能体辩论召回率更高但存在过度标记问题。

Conclusion: DialogGuard为敏感场景下LLM的安全评估提供了可扩展、可解释、可协作的评估工具，已开源并集成网页界面，支持提示工程、系统审计与面向脆弱用户的应用监管。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental-health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discriminatory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse generative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog-Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language rationales. A formative study with 12 practitioners illustrates how it supports prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users.

TL;DR: 本文指出现代AI系统在自我监控、自我纠正和自主行为调节方面存在根本性局限，识别出七大核心缺陷，并提出基于神经认知原理的架构演进路径，倡导向'认知自主性AI'范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在感知、语言、推理和多模态等领域快速发展，但其在动态环境中缺乏自我监控、自我纠正和自主行为调节能力，现有架构（如深度学习和Transformer）无法实现鲁棒泛化、终身适应性和真实世界自主性。

Method: 通过比较人工系统与生物认知，整合AI研究、认知科学与神经科学的洞见，系统识别并分析当前AI模型的七大结构性缺陷，并提出以神经认知原理为指导的未来架构方向。

Result: 明确了七类核心缺陷：缺乏内在自我监控、元认知意识、自适应学习机制、目标重构能力、表征维持能力、具身反馈及内在能动性；指出单纯扩大规模无法解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 主张转向‘认知自主性AI’范式，强调自我导向适应、动态表征管理与目标导向行为，并配套可解释、可治理、价值对齐的改革性监督机制。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为交互式智能体调用树（IACT）的新型计算模型，通过动态、递归构建智能体拓扑结构，并以双向、有状态对话替代传统单向调用，提升自主性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态、硬编码智能体工作流的局限性，支持开放性任务中自主扩展组织复杂度，并缓解单向函数调用导致的错误传播问题。

Method: 设计基于用户对话驱动的通用自主系统，动态生成递归式智能体调用树；引入双向、有状态对话机制实现交互冗余，支持运行时错误纠正与歧义消解；在kragent.ai系统中完成生产部署并总结实践经验。

Result: 实现了可随任务结构自适应扩展的动态智能体拓扑；验证了双向对话机制对错误传播抑制和歧义处理的有效性；提供了真实工作流中的定性证据。

Conclusion: IACT为构建面向开放任务的自主智能体系统提供了一种更具灵活性、鲁棒性和可扩展性的新范式。

Abstract: This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MERINDA是一种面向FPGA加速的模型恢复框架，通过可并行化的神经网络架构替代传统的迭代求解器，在边缘设备上显著降低内存和能耗，适用于资源受限的实时关键任务系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型恢复（MR）在关键自主系统中具有重要意义，但基于神经常微分方程（NODEs）的传统方法因迭代特性导致在FPGA等边缘设备上效率低下，难以满足实时性、低功耗和低内存的需求。

Method: 提出MERINDA框架，用可并行化的神经网络结构替代NODE中的迭代求解器，针对FPGA进行优化设计，提升计算效率并减少对外部存储的依赖。

Result: 相比移动GPU，MERINDA实现了约11倍的DRAM使用量下降和2.2倍的运行速度提升，并揭示了在固定精度下内存与能耗之间的反比关系。

Conclusion: MERINDA为在资源受限的边缘设备上部署高效、实时的模型恢复提供了可行方案，特别适用于安全关键型自主系统的实际应用。

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种量子启发的乳腺细胞分割框架，在仅使用599张训练图像的情况下实现了95.5%的Dice分数，显著缓解了医学图像标注耗时耗力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注需要大量时间和专家知识，尤其在乳腺上皮细胞核数据集标注中，病理学家需投入数百小时；同时存在严重类别不平衡（目标区域仅占0.1%-20%）和大量无目标区域图像等问题。

Method: 提出量子启发的多尺度Gabor边缘增强（新增第四通道）、稳定多组分损失函数（自适应Dice损失+边界感知项+自动正样本加权）、复杂度加权采样策略，并采用EfficientNet-B7/UNet++架构与4-to-3通道投影以利用预训练权重；结合指数滑动平均与统计异常检测进行鲁棒验证。

Result: 在小验证集（129张图像）上达到Dice 95.5% ± 0.3%，IoU 91.2% ± 0.4%；量子增强提升边界精度2.1%，加权采样提升小病灶检出率3.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法以极少量标注数据实现高性能分割，大幅降低临床AI数据构建对专家时间的依赖，突破了临床感知AI发展的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniGuard，首个具备跨模态安全防护能力的多模态大模型守门员系统，通过构建包含21万多样本的多模态安全数据集，并结合专家模型蒸馏生成结构化安全标签与批评，实现了在15个基准上的强泛化性与有效性。


<details>

Conclusion: OmniGuard为构建更鲁棒、更通用的多模态AI安全体系提供了新范式，是迈向全模态价值对齐与风险管控的关键一步。

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为ReMindView-Bench的认知驱动多视角空间推理基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在构建、对齐和维持跨视角空间心理模型方面的能力；实验发现现有VLMs在跨视角对齐和视角转换上存在系统性缺陷，并通过显式与隐式分析揭示了其空间推理过程中的信息退化机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在多视角空间推理中难以保持几何一致性和跨视角一致性，主因是缺乏能剥离单视角感知与时间因素、专注于多视角推理的细粒度评测基准。

Method: 构建认知驱动的多视角空间推理基准ReMindView-Bench，系统调控视角空间模式与问题类型；结合LLM-as-a-judge与自一致性提示进行显式分阶段推理分析，并通过线性探针与熵动态分析开展隐式表征诊断。

Result: 15个主流VLM在跨视角对齐和视角转换任务中表现持续不佳；显式分析显示其帧内感知能力强但跨视图整合能力急剧下降；隐式分析揭示任务相关信息随推理阶段逐步丢失，且正确与错误轨迹的不确定性分离度低。

Conclusion: 现有VLM的空间心理模型构建存在根本性缺陷：多视角信息整合薄弱、不确定性建模不足，导致空间模型易退化与失稳；ReMindView-Bench为诊断和改进VLM空间推理能力提供了认知 grounded 的评测与分析框架。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

Conclusion: 所提LLM驱动的生成式智能体仿真框架为MMO数值设计提供了可靠、高效且可解释的离线优化新范式。

Abstract: Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用带有合成错误注入的监督学习来诱导语言模型自我纠正能力的方法，尽管直觉上该方法有吸引力，但研究发现它在多个模型上的简单合成任务中未能显著提高性能。即使模型能够捕捉到自己的错误，也常常重复原始错误。研究还发现，合成错误与策略内错误之间的分布差异显著降低了微调模型的错误纠正能力，即使合成错误对策略内错误有良好的覆盖。这些结果解释了为什么基于策略的强化学习方法在激发自我纠正方面表现出独特有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习已成为激发大型语言模型推理和自我纠正能力的主要范式，但其计算成本较高，促使人们探索替代方法。受自动驾驶和机器人技术的启发，研究者希望验证监督学习结合合成错误注入是否能有效诱导语言模型的自我纠正能力。

Method: 提出一种方法：在推理链中插入人工错误并将其掩码，然后监督模型识别并纠正这些错误。通过这种方式训练模型以实现自我纠正。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个模型和简单合成任务上均未能显著提升性能；即便模型能发现错误，也常会重复原错误；合成错误与实际策略错误间的分布差异显著削弱了模型的纠错能力。

Conclusion: 合成错误注入的监督学习难以有效迁移至真实错误场景，解释了为何基于策略的强化学习在自我纠正任务中更具优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

Motivation: 预测市场存在因问题重叠、隐含等价和隐藏矛盾导致的碎片化问题，亟需自动化方法挖掘其潜在语义结构。

Method: 构建一个自主智能体AI流水线：（i）利用自然语言理解对合约文本与元数据进行聚类；（ii）在每个聚类内识别具有强依赖性（同结果/反结果）的市场对；并在Polymarket历史已结算数据上评估预测准确性及交易策略收益。

Conclusion: 大语言模型驱动的智能体AI能有效揭示预测市场中隐含的语义结构，并转化为可盈利的交易信号。

Abstract: Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

Method: 提出R-Few：一种引导式Self-Play Challenger-Solver框架，Challenger基于少量人工标注样例生成合成问题，Solver在在线难度课程下联合训练人工与合成数据，并引入上下文接地与混合训练机制。

Result: 在数学与通用推理基准上实现持续迭代提升；Qwen3-8B-Base在数学任务上较R-Zero提升+3.0分，性能媲美使用20倍人工数据训练的General-Reasoner；消融实验验证各模块有效性，分析表明R-Few有效缓解概念漂移。

Conclusion: R-Few实现了更稳定、可控、低监督的模型自演化路径，为通向超级智能提供了可行框架。

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记富含信息但为非结构化，难以被传统预测模型有效利用；亟需一种能从非结构化文本中准确、可解释、隐私安全地预测AIS患者预后的方案。

Method: 提出COPE框架：基于开源LLaMA-3-8B构建两步链式思维流程——第一步生成临床推理过程，第二步输出mRS预测；在464例AIS患者的出院小结和90天mRS数据上进行训练与评估，并与GPT-4.1、ClinicalBERT、结构化机器学习模型及单步LLM对比。

Result: COPE达到MAE=1.01、±1准确率74.4%、精确准确率32.8%，性能媲美GPT-4.1，显著优于ClinicalBERT（MAE=1.24）、Clinical ML（MAE=1.28）和单步LLM（MAE=1.20）；亚组分析显示其在不同性别、年龄组中稳健，仅在高龄、接受取栓术及长病程摘要患者中误差略高。

Conclusion: COPE是一种轻量、可解释、隐私友好的开源框架，为基于非结构化临床文本的卒中预后预测提供了准确且实用的新范式。

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries.

Conclusion: Aetheria建立了一个透明、可解释的内容审核范式，显著推动了可信AI内容 moderation 的发展。

Abstract: The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合视频、音频和文本的多模态共情预测方法，并引入监督文档作为训练阶段的特权信息，以提升文本特征提取效果，实验表明该方法优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共情预测方法多局限于单一模态（尤其是文本），且未利用可能包含额外共情信息的特权信息。

Method: 提出多模态共情预测与监督文档辅助训练框架；使用预训练网络提取各模态特征，进行跨模态融合；在训练中引入由监督者构建的监督文档作为特权信息，并用LDA模型提取主题分布以约束文本特征。

Conclusion: 融合多模态信息并合理利用训练阶段的特权信息（如监督文档）可显著提升共情预测性能。

Abstract: Prevalent empathy prediction techniques primarily concentrate on a singular modality, typically textual, thus neglecting multi-modal processing capabilities. They also overlook the utilization of certain privileged information, which may encompass additional empathetic content. In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的跨域剩余使用寿命（RUL）预测方法TACDA，通过目标域重构和聚类配对策略，有效缓解了领域分布差异问题，并在实验中优于现有先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的RUL预测方法通常假设训练与测试数据来自相同分布，在实际工业场景中这一假设常不成立；此外，现有领域自适应方法忽略了目标域特有信息及退化阶段的不一致性，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出TACDA方法，结合对抗域适应框架，引入目标域重构策略以保留目标域特定信息，并设计新的聚类与配对策略，实现相似退化阶段的一致对齐。

Result: 在多个实验中，TACDA在两种不同评估指标下均优于当前最先进的方法，表现出卓越的跨域RUL预测性能。

Conclusion: TACDA能有效处理跨域RUL预测中的分布差异问题，兼顾领域不变特征与目标域特有信息，提升了模型在真实工业场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/keyplay/TACDA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于有限自动机解释LTL指令的方法在多个原子命题同时为真且存在复杂交互的环境中表现不足。

Method: 将策略条件化于自动机转移所对应的简单布尔公式序列，并使用图神经网络（GNN）对其进行编码，生成结构化的任务表征。

Result: 在复杂的棋类环境中实验验证了该方法的有效性，展现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了RL智能体在高并发、强交互场景下对任意LTL指令的泛化执行能力。

Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

*Zhiyuan He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了大语言模型在处理递归推理（即深度嵌套结构）时存在深度泛化能力不足的问题，并提出一种循环式的‘定位-替换’流水线方法，通过两个专用模型协同分解和求解深层递归问题，在布尔代数、递归算术和命题逻辑任务上显著提升了深度外推性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型虽在长度泛化上表现良好，但在深度泛化（即处理训练时未见的更深嵌套层级）方面存在明显缺陷，尤其缺乏类栈机制来跟踪多层嵌套依赖，这一问题尚未被系统研究。

Method: 提出一种循环式‘定位-替换’流水线： locator 模型识别当前可解的最内层子表达式，replacer 模型对其进行求值并替换回原结构，迭代执行直至问题完全解决；在布尔代数、递归算术和命题逻辑三个可控深度的领域中进行验证。

Result: 该方法在超出训练分布的递归深度上显著缓解了性能衰减，展现出良好的深度泛化能力，而标准Transformer模型随深度增加性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: Transformer架构固有的深度泛化瓶颈源于其缺乏显式栈行为；所提模块化、迭代式定位-替换机制为提升模型对深层递归结构的建模能力提供了可行且有效的路径。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR)框架，通过识别情绪主导模态并据此重构推理顺序，提升多模态大语言模型在情绪理解中的推理可靠性，显著减少情感不一致解释的发生率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情绪理解中存在推理漂移问题：模型逐渐依赖自生成文本而非多模态证据，且解释过度受视觉推理路径影响。

Method: 提出模态重要性（MI）机制以识别情绪主导模态，并基于此重构推理序列；采用两阶段框架：模态对齐的监督微调和模态感知的奖励优化。

Result: 在DFEW基准上，MIGR将正确预测但解释情感不一致的案例从18.10%降至7.37%，显著提升推理可靠性。

Conclusion: 从情绪主导模态启动推理能有效提升多模态情绪理解中解释的可靠性与一致性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

Abstract: As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康问题全球高发但早期检测困难；大型语言模型计算开销大、难部署；小型语言模型在社交媒体心理健康预测中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出Menta模型，采用LoRA微调框架、跨数据集训练策略及面向平衡准确率的损失函数，联合训练六个分类任务。

Result: 在六项心理健康任务上平均提升15.2%（相比最佳非微调SLM）；在抑郁和压力分类上超过13B参数LLM；模型体积缩小约3.25倍；可在iPhone 15 Pro Max上实时运行，仅需约3GB内存。

Conclusion: Menta验证了轻量级SLM在可扩展、隐私保护的心理健康监测中的巨大潜力，为实际落地提供了新路径。

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票价格预测因市场波动性和对实时事件的敏感性而具有挑战性；现有大语言模型在金融领域的应用受限于新闻数据噪声大、文本中缺乏明确答案，以及通用记忆架构难以识别价格变动的关键驱动因素。

Method: 提出StockMem事件-反思双层记忆框架：1）事件层通过横向整合（每日事件聚合）和纵向追踪（事件演化分析）构建时序事件知识库；2）反思层基于事件-价格动态关系挖掘因果经验，构建反射知识库；3）预测阶段通过检索历史相似场景，融合当前事件、增量信息与过往经验进行推理。

Result: 实验表明StockMem优于现有记忆架构，在预测性能和可解释性方面均有提升，能追溯影响价格的信息链，增强金融决策透明度。

Conclusion: StockMem通过结构化新闻事件与因果反思机制，有效提升了股票价格预测的准确性与可解释性，为金融领域的大模型应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Abstract: Auditors rely on Journal Entry Tests (JETs) to detect anomalies in tax-related ledger records, but rule-based methods generate overwhelming false positives and struggle with subtle irregularities. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as anomaly detectors in double-entry bookkeeping.

Our results show that LLMs consistently outperform traditional rule-based JETs and classical ML baselines, while also providing natural-language explanations that enhance interpretability. These results highlight the potential of \textbf{AI-augmented auditing}, where human auditors collaborate with foundation models to strengthen financial integrity.

Result: 证明GVU算子在参数流形上生成向量场；将自改进率κ严格定义为能力泛函的李导数；给出κ>0的噪声约束条件（方差不等式）；统一解释LSP、Self-Correction、合成数据等范式为GVU的不同实现。

Conclusion: 自改进可被严格建模为参数流形上的几何流动，其稳定性由生成与验证环节的联合噪声控制；方差不等式为设计鲁棒自优化系统提供了普适性理论准则。

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

Conclusion: 所提prompt-free协作代理框架有效解决了现有论文到代码生成中验证与精炼依赖人工提示的问题，提升了自动化复现的质量、可扩展性与实用性。

Abstract: Automated paper reproduction has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate scientific research, employing multi-step workflow frameworks to systematically convert academic papers into executable code. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\% and 13\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents.

Abstract: Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

### [301] [Martingale Score: An Unsupervised Metric for Bayesian Rationality in LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02914)
*Zhonghao He,Tianyi Qiu,Hirokazu Shirado,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于鞅性质的无监督评估框架（Martingale Score）来检测大语言模型（LLM）在迭代推理中是否出现信念固化（belief entrenchment），发现该现象广泛存在，并验证该指标能有效预测推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管迭代推理技术提升了LLM性能，但新证据表明其可能加剧信念固化和确认偏误，而非促进求真；亟需一种不依赖真值标签的系统性评估方法。

Method: 利用贝叶斯统计中的鞅性质（当前信念应等于未来信念的期望值），构建无监督、回归式的Martingale Score，量化信念更新对当前信念的可预测性偏差；在事件预测、价值判断、论文评审等开放域开展实证分析。

Result: 发现多种LLM及推理方法普遍存在信念固化（当前信念正向预测后续更新）；识别出更易发生该现象的模型、技术与领域；Martingale Score能显著预测真实准确率，验证其作为求真能力代理指标的有效性。

Conclusion: Martingale Score是一种有效的无监督指标，揭示了当前LLM推理中普遍存在的非理性信念更新倾向，为评估和改进模型的真理导向推理能力提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

### [302] [Invasive Context Engineering to Control Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03001)
*Thomas Rivasseau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“侵入式上下文工程”的技术，通过在大语言模型的上下文中插入控制语句来增强其在长上下文场景下的安全性，防止对抗攻击和模型越狱，且不依赖于模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型在长上下文情况下仍易受攻击和滥用，现有的训练和过滤方法难以提供足够的安全保证，尤其是在数据稀缺的长上下文训练中存在局限性。

Method: 提出“侵入式上下文工程”方法，在输入上下文中插入控制语句，并可扩展至思维链过程以防止策略性行为，该方法不依赖模型训练，仅通过上下文修改实现控制。

Result: 该方法能够在不进行模型训练的情况下，有效降低长上下文中的越狱风险，提升模型对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，并具有向思维链推理过程推广的潜力。

Conclusion: 侵入式上下文工程为大语言模型提供了一种无需训练、易于部署的安全增强手段，尤其适用于长上下文场景，具有良好的实用前景。

Abstract: Current research on operator control of Large Language Models improves model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on preference examples, prompting, and input/output filtering. Despite good results, LLMs remain susceptible to abuse, and jailbreak probability increases with context length. There is a need for robust LLM security guarantees in long-context situations. We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.
