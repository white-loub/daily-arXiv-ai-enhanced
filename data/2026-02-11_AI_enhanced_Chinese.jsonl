In this proof-of-concept paper, we introduce inclusion analytics, a discourse-based framework for examining inclusion as a dynamic, interactional process in CPS. We conceptualize inclusion along three complementary dimensions -- participation equity, affective climate, and epistemic equity -- and demonstrate how these constructs can be made analytically visible using scalable, interaction-level measures. Using both simulated conversations and empirical data from human-AI teaming experiments, we illustrate how inclusion analytics can surface patterns of participation, relational dynamics, and idea uptake that remain invisible to aggregate or post-hoc evaluations.

While current explanations often point to increased test-time computation or structural guidance, establishing a consistent, quantifiable link between these factors and generalization remains challenging. In this work, we identify intrinsic dimensionality as a quantitative measure for characterizing the effectiveness of reasoning chains. Intrinsic dimensionality quantifies the minimum number of model dimensions needed to reach a given accuracy threshold on a given task. By keeping the model architecture fixed and varying the task formulation through different reasoning strategies, we demonstrate that effective reasoning strategies consistently reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of the task. Validating this on GSM8K with Gemma-3 1B and 4B, we observe a strong inverse correlation between the intrinsic dimensionality of a reasoning strategy and its generalization performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

In this paper, we present a topic continuity model aimed at assessing whether a response aligns with the initial conversation topic. Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula. In contrast to many NLU models constrained by token limits, our proposed model can seamlessly handle conversations of any length with linear time complexity. Furthermore, the attention mechanism significantly improves the model's ability to identify topic continuity in complex conversations.

Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions.

Recent advances in model scaling have shown promising gains in recommendation. However, naively increasing model capacity imposes prohibitive online inference costs and often yields diminishing returns for sparse tasks with skewed label distributions. This mismatch between uniform parameter scaling and heterogeneous task capacity demands poses a fundamental challenge for scalable multi-task recommendation. In this work, we investigate parameter sparsification as a principled scaling paradigm and identify two critical obstacles when applying sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to multi-task recommendation: exploded expert activation that undermines instance-level sparsity and expert load skew caused by independent task-wise routing. To address these challenges, we propose SMES, a scalable sparse MoE framework with progressive expert routing. SMES decomposes expert activation into a task-shared expert subset jointly selected across tasks and task-adaptive private experts, explicitly bounding per-instance expert execution while preserving task-specific capacity. In addition, SMES introduces a global multi-gate load-balancing regularizer that stabilizes training by regulating aggregated expert utilization across all tasks. SMES has been deployed in Kuaishou large-scale short-video services, supporting over 400 million daily active users.

The TDCR under consideration is a two-segment robot driven by eight tendons, with four tendon actuators per segment. Tendon forces are treated as design variables, while the feasible static workspace (FSW) serves as the optimization objective. To determine the robot's feasible static workspace, a genetic algorithm optimization approach is employed to maximize a Euclidian norm of the TDCR's tip position over the workspace. During the simulations, the robot is subjected to external loads, including torques and forces. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying optimal tendon forces to maximize the feasible static workspace, even under the influence of external forces and torques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u884c\u9759\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08FSW\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08TDCR\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672b\u7aef\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6b27\u6c0f\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u529b\u548c\u529b\u77e9\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u9759\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u808c\u8171\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8003\u8651\u5916\u90e8\u529b\u548c\u529b\u77e9\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316TDCR\u672b\u7aef\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6b27\u6c0f\u8303\u6570\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u9759\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f18\u808c\u8171\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5927TDCR\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u529b\u548c\u529b\u77e9\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u9759\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eFSW\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aTDCR\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods encounter an information bottleneck when generating graph-level representations. The prevalent single token paradigm fails to fully leverage the inherent strength of self-attention in encoding token sequences, and degenerates into a weighted sum of node signals. To address this issue, we design a novel serialized token paradigm to encapsulate global signals more effectively. Specifically, a graph serialization method is proposed to aggregate node signals into serialized graph tokens, with positional encoding being automatically involved. Then, stacked self-attention layers are applied to encode this token sequence and capture its internal dependencies. Our method can yield more expressive graph representations by modeling complex interactions among multiple graph tokens. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several graph-level benchmarks. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed modules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u6807\u8bb0\u8303\u5f0f\uff08serialized token paradigm\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u56fe\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u5806\u53e0\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u6807\u8bb0\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5355\u6807\u8bb0\u8303\u5f0f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u6807\u8bb0\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56fe\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u4fe1\u53f7\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u5e26\u81ea\u52a8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u56fe\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u7528\u5806\u53e0\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u6807\u8bb0\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c01\u88c5\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u6807\u8bb0\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \\$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Cadmus\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u5e03\u754c\u5b9a\u4e0d\u6e05\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u5e94\u96be\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u5206\u8bcd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u660e\u3001\u7b97\u529b\u4e0e\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCadmus\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u6574\u6570\u865a\u62df\u673a\uff08VM\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e200\u7f8e\u5143\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63d2\u6869\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49DSL\u4e0b\u7684\u6574\u6570\u7b97\u672f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCadmus\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230100%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-5\uff0895%\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793aGPT-5\u5f15\u5165\u672a\u77e5\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3-\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u7cfb\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578b\u53ef\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Cadmus\uff09\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u3001\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89c4\u907fLLM\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u5148\u9a8c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The complexity of several topics is asymptotic to that encountered in research-level studies, however, the analysis is presented in a step-by-step manner to facilitate access to commonly used methods and tools.\n  The material is divided into three main parts.

While recent scaling efforts have improved model capacity, they often fail to construct both context-aware and context-independent user intent from the long-term and real-time behavior sequence. Meanwhile, recent work also suffers from inefficient and homogeneous interaction mechanisms, leading to suboptimal prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose HeMix, a scalable ranking model that unifies adaptive sequence tokenization and heterogeneous interaction structure. Specifically, HeMix introduces a Query-Mixed Interest Extraction module that jointly models context-aware and context-independent user interests via dynamic and fixed queries over global and real-time behavior sequences. For interaction, we replace self-attention with the HeteroMixer block, enabling efficient, multi-granularity cross-feature interactions that adopt the multi-head token fusion, heterogeneous interaction and group-aligned reconstruction pipelines.

While most existing approaches treat human as point mass, we present a study on multi-agent trajectory prediction that leverages different human skeletal features for improved forecast accuracy. In particular, we systematically evaluate the predictive utility of 2D and 3D skeletal keypoints and derived biomechanical cues as additional inputs. Through a comprehensive study on the JRDB dataset and another new dataset for social navigation with 360-degree panoramic videos, we find that focusing on lower-body 3D keypoints yields a 13% reduction in Average Displacement Error and augmenting 3D keypoint inputs with corresponding biomechanical cues provides a further 1-4% improvement. Notably, the performance gain persists when using 2D keypoint inputs extracted from equirectangular panoramic images, indicating that monocular surround vision can capture informative cues for motion forecasting.

Empirical evidence indicates that high-dimensional embeddings tend to collapse into narrow cones, concentrating task-relevant semantics in a small subspace, while the majority of dimensions remain occupied by noise and spurious correlations. Such spectral imbalance and entanglement undermine model generalization. We propose Spectral Disentanglement and Enhancement (SDE), a novel framework that bridges the gap between the geometry of the embedded spaces and their spectral properties. Our approach leverages singular value decomposition to adaptively partition feature dimensions into strong signals that capture task-critical semantics, weak signals that reflect ancillary correlations, and noise representing irrelevant perturbations. A curriculum-based spectral enhancement strategy is then applied, selectively amplifying informative components with theoretical guarantees on training stability. Building upon the enhanced features, we further introduce a dual-domain contrastive loss that jointly optimizes alignment in both the feature and spectral spaces, effectively integrating spectral regularization into the training process and encouraging richer, more robust representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SDE consistently improves representation robustness and generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

We propose Agent Banana, a hierarchical agentic planner-executor framework for high-fidelity, object-aware, deliberative editing. Agent Banana introduces two key mechanisms: (1) Context Folding, which compresses long interaction histories into structured memory for stable long-horizon control; and (2) Image Layer Decomposition, which performs localized layer-based edits to preserve non-target regions while enabling native-resolution outputs. To support rigorous evaluation, we build HDD-Bench, a high-definition, dialogue-based benchmark featuring verifiable stepwise targets and native 4K images (11.8M pixels) for diagnosing long-horizon failures. On HDD-Bench, Agent Banana achieves the best multi-turn consistency and background fidelity (e.g., IC 0.871, SSIM-OM 0.84, LPIPS-OM 0.12) while remaining competitive on instruction following, and also attains strong performance on standard single-turn editing benchmarks.

To demonstrate framework's versatility, our implementation uses three modalities - speech, text and facial imagery. However, the system is fully modular, and can be extended to support other modalities or tasks. Each modality is processed through a dedicated backbone optimized for inference efficiency: Emotion2Vec for speech, a ResNet-based model for facial expressions, and DistilRoBERTa for text. To reconcile uncertainty across modalities, we introduce a model- and task-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence. Operating directly on model logits, this approach captures predictive uncertainty without requiring additional training or joint distribution estimation, making it broadly applicable beyond emotion recognition. Validation on five benchmark datasets (eNTERFACE05, MEAD, MELD, RAVDESS and CREMA-D) show that our method achieves competitive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient and robust to ambiguous or missing inputs. Overall, the proposed framework emphasizes modularity, scalability, and real-world feasibility, paving the way toward uncertainty-aware multimodal systems for healthcare, human-computer interaction, and other emotion-informed applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08MER\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528Emotion2Vec\u3001ResNet\u548cDistilRoBERTa\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eDempster-Shafer\u7406\u8bba\u4e0eDirichlet\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931/\u6a21\u7cca\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5411\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u517c\u987e\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u5316MER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff08Emotion2Vec\u3001ResNet\u3001DistilRoBERTa\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eDempster-Shafer\u7406\u8bba\u4e0eDirichlet\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578blogits\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728eNTERFACE05\u3001MEAD\u3001MELD\u3001RAVDESS\u548cCREMA-D\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f3a\u8c03\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b49\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We propose The Hypothesis Game, a symbolic formalism for hypothesis refinement in which LLM agents operate on a shared hypothesis state using a fixed grammar of reasoning moves. The framework is motivated by the observation that scientific progress often proceeds through small, localized revisions, grounded in domain context, rather than extensive rewrites. We instantiate a minimal game with LLM agents and evaluate it on pathway-level mechanistic refinement tasks. In the primary setting of corruption recovery, where hypotheses contain controlled errors, the game-based approach consistently removes more errors and achieves higher precision than strong prompting baselines, while preserving valid structure through incremental edits. In a secondary reconstruction setting from partial cues, it performs comparably to the strongest baseline, indicating that explicit move-based refinement remains competitive even when ground-truth recovery is difficult.

In industrial deployment, two common approaches exhibit fundamental limitations: discrete semantic abstractions sacrifice descriptive precision through clustering, while dense multimodal embeddings are extracted independently and remain weakly aligned with ranking optimization, limiting fine-grained content-aware ranking. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{SARM}, an end-to-end ranking architecture that integrates natural-language semantic anchors directly into ranking optimization, enabling fine-grained author representations conditioned on multimodal content. Each semantic anchor is represented as learnable text tokens jointly optimized with ranking features, allowing the model to adapt content descriptions to ranking objectives.

This imbalance is not necessarily due to hardware limitations, but rather to the absence of principled control frameworks that explain when and how additional legs improve locomotion performance. In multi-legged systems, coordinating many simultaneous contacts introduces a severe curse of dimensionality that challenges existing modeling and control approaches. As an alternative, multi-legged robots are typically controlled using low-dimensional gaits originally developed for bipeds or quadrupeds. These strategies fail to exploit the new symmetries and control opportunities that emerge in higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we develop a principled framework for discovering new control structures in multi-legged locomotion. We use geometric mechanics to reduce contact-rich locomotion planning to a graph optimization problem, and propose a spin model duality framework from statistical mechanics to exploit symmetry breaking and guide optimal gait reorganization. Using this approach, we identify an asymmetric locomotion strategy for a hexapod robot that achieves a forward speed of 0.61 body lengths per cycle (a 50% improvement over conventional gaits). The resulting asymmetry appears at both the control and hardware levels. At the control level, the body orientation oscillates asymmetrically between fast clockwise and slow counterclockwise turning phases for forward locomotion. At the hardware level, two legs on the same side remain unactuated and can be replaced with rigid parts without degrading performance. Numerical simulations and robophysical experiments validate the framework and reveal novel locomotion behaviors that emerge from symmetry reforming in high-dimensional embodied systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u81ea\u65cb\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5728\u516d\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534750%\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6b65\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5177\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7531\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u65b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u53cc\u8db3\u548c\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u2018\u4f55\u65f6\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u817f\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u2019\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u591a\u8db3\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u63a5\u89e6\u534f\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6b65\u6001\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u529b\u5b66\u5c06\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6e90\u81ea\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5076\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\u6307\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u6b65\u6001\u91cd\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u524d\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe0.61\u4f53\u957f/\u5468\u671f\uff08\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u6b65\u6001\u63d0\u534750%\uff09\uff1b\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8eab\u4f53\u671d\u5411\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u987a\u65f6\u9488\u4e0e\u6162\u901f\u9006\u65f6\u9488\u8f6c\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u95f4\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u632f\u8361\uff1b\u786c\u4ef6\u5c42\u9762\u663e\u793a\u540c\u4fa7\u4e24\u6761\u817f\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u88ab\u52a8\u5316\u751a\u81f3\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u521a\u6027\u90e8\u4ef6\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u591a\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5177\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u53ef\u6d8c\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u8db3\u4e43\u81f3\u8d85\u591a\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5960\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, in gated linear attention models, this memory has a fixed capacity and is prone to interference, especially for long sequences. We propose Palimpsa, a self-attention model that views ICL as a continual learning problem that must address a stability-plasticity dilemma. Palimpsa uses Bayesian metaplasticity, where the plasticity of each attention state is tied to an importance state grounded by a prior distribution that captures accumulated knowledge. We demonstrate that various gated linear attention models emerge as specific architecture choices and posterior approximations, and that Mamba2 is a special case of Palimpsa where forgetting dominates. This theoretical link enables the transformation of any non-metaplastic model into a metaplastic one, significantly expanding its memory capacity.

Existing video representation approaches overly rely on static appearance and scene context rather than motion dynamics, a bias inherited from their training data and objectives. Conversely, traditional motion-centric inputs like optical flow lack the semantic grounding needed to understand high-level motion. To demonstrate this inherent bias, we introduce the SimMotion benchmarks, combining controlled synthetic data with a new human-annotated real-world dataset. We show that existing models perform poorly on these benchmarks, often failing to disentangle motion from appearance. To address this gap, we propose SemanticMoments, a simple, training-free method that computes temporal statistics (specifically, higher-order moments) over features from pre-trained semantic models. Across our benchmarks, SemanticMoments consistently outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods. This demonstrates that temporal statistics in a semantic feature space provide a scalable and perceptually grounded foundation for motion-centric video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSemanticMoments\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u9636\u65f6\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684SimMotion\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RGB\u3001\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6d41\u7b49\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u53c8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u5747\u96be\u4ee5\u771f\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemanticMoments\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6cbf\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u9636\u77e9\uff08\u5982\u5747\u503c\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u504f\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684SimMotion\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u542b\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cSemanticMoments\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709RGB\u3001\u5149\u6d41\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u89e3\u8026\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u5408\u7406\uff08perceptually grounded\uff09\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We propose Progress-Aware Belief Update (PABU), a belief-state framework that compactly represents an agent's state by explicitly modeling task progress and selectively retaining past actions and observations. At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%. Additionally, PABU's progress-oriented action selection improves efficiency, reducing the average number of interaction steps to 9.5, corresponding to a 26.9% reduction.

Since these models are not originally trained for recommendation tasks, recent works efficiently adapt them via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, even with PEFT, item embeddings from multimodal foundation models remain user-blind: item embeddings are not conditioned on user interests, despite the fact that users with diverse interests attend to different item aspects. To address this limitation, we propose PerPEFT, a personalized PEFT strategy for multimodal recommendation. Specifically, PerPEFT groups users by interest and assigns a distinct PEFT module to each group, enabling each module to capture the fine-grained item aspects most predictive of that group`s purchase decisions. We further introduce a specialized training technique that strengthens this user-group conditioning. Notably, PerPEFT is PEFT-agnostic and can be paired with any PEFT method applicable to multimodal foundation models. Through extensive experiments, we show that (1) PerPEFT outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 15.3% (NDCG@20) and (2) delivers consistent gains across diverse PEFT variants. It is noteworthy that, even with personalization, PEFT remains lightweight, adding only 1.3% of the parameter count of the foundation model.

Yet the variability of graphical layouts, typographic conventions, and platform-specific design patterns renders manual indexing impractical. This work presents a comprehensive framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from broadcast and social-media-native news videos. It introduces a curated and balanced corpus of annotated frames capturing the diversity of contemporary news graphics and proposes an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed to operate under deterministic and auditable conditions.\n  The pipeline is evaluated against a contrasting class of generative multimodal methods, revealing a clear trade-off between deterministic auditability and stochastic inference. The underlying detector achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, demonstrating operationally robust performance for graphical element localisation. While generative systems achieve marginally higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18% vs 77.08%), they lack the transparent data lineage required for journalistic and analytical contexts. The proposed pipeline delivers balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), avoids hallucination, and provides full traceability across each processing stage. Complementary user findings indicate that 59% of respondents report difficulty reading on-screen names in fast-paced broadcasts, underscoring the practical relevance of the task.

Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish. Importantly, differences in the volume of country-level digital resources do not account for these performance patterns, suggesting that factors beyond data quantity shape dialectal representation in LLMs. By providing a fine-grained, large-scale evaluation of geographic lexical variation, this work advances empirical understanding of dialectal knowledge in LLMs and contributes new evidence to discussions of Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u5730\u7406\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u3001\u8d64\u9053\u51e0\u5185\u4e9a\u3001\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u4e0e\u4e2d\u7f8e\u6d32\u53ca\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u5854\u6cb3\u5730\u533a\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u667a\u5229\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u7528\u5404\u56fd\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u6e90\u6570\u91cf\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5730\u57df\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u2018\u865a\u62df\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u2019\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5f02\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u6570\u5b57\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLMs\u89c6\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u8c03\u67e5\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u662f\u975e\u9898\u548c\u591a\u9009\u9898\u4e24\u79cd\u95ee\u5377\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e13\u5bb6\u6574\u7406\u7684\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u5f02\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30900\u591a\u4e2a\u8bcd\u6c47\u9879\u572821\u4e2a\u897f\u8bed\u56fd\u5bb6\u53ca\u65b9\u8a00\u533a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65b9\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u5bf9\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u3001\u8d64\u9053\u51e0\u5185\u4e9a\u3001\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u4e0e\u4e2d\u7f8e\u6d32\u3001\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u5854\u6cb3\u5730\u533a\u53d8\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u66f4\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u667a\u5229\u53d8\u4f53\u6700\u96be\u533a\u5206\uff1b\u56fd\u5bb6\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u6e90\u603b\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u65b9\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6570\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u66f4\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u53ca\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u591a\u91cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5236\u7ea6\uff1b\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9LLMs\u65b9\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Yet, despite its importance, little is known about how design frameworks can guide systematic form exploration. To address this gap, we introduce Elements of Robot Morphology, a framework that identifies five fundamental elements: perception, articulation, end effectors, locomotion, and structure.

In this work, we embrace the idea of looping back to move forward: reusing model parameters through recursive refinement to extract stronger multimodal representations without increasing model size. We propose RecursiveVLM, a recursive Transformer architecture tailored for LMMs. Two key innovations enable effective looping: (i) a Recursive Connector that aligns features across recursion steps by fusing intermediate-layer hidden states and applying modality-specific projections, respecting the distinct statistical structures of vision and language tokens; (ii) a Monotonic Recursion Loss that supervises every step and guarantees performance improves monotonically with recursion depth. This design transforms recursion into an on-demand refinement mechanism: delivering strong results with few loops on resource-constrained devices and progressively improving outputs when more computation resources are available. Experiments show consistent gains of +3% over standard Transformers and +7% over vanilla recursive baselines, demonstrating that strategic looping is a powerful path toward efficient, deployment-adaptive LMMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRecursiveVLM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u7ec6\u5316\u91cd\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5e38\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRecursiveVLM\uff1a\u5305\u542bRecursive Connector\uff08\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u505a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6295\u5f71\uff09\u548cMonotonic Recursion Loss\uff08\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u6b65\u9012\u5f52\u6027\u80fd\u5355\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u63d0\u5347+3%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u9012\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347+7%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u7ec6\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684LMM\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Identifying which low-risk patients are at higher risk of progression is a critical unmet need for tailored surveillance and preventative therapeutic strategies.

Advancements in digital pathology and machine learning provide an opportunity to analyze whole-slide images (WSIs) comprehensively and objectively.

Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information.

Among these, POS tag projection with word alignment method transfers POS tags from a high-resource source language to a low-resource target language based on parallel corpora, making it particularly suitable for low-resource language settings. However, this approach relies heavily on parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for many low-resource languages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully unsupervised cross-lingual part-of-speech(POS) tagging framework that relies solely on monolingual corpora by leveraging unsupervised neural machine translation(UNMT) system. This UNMT system first translates sentences from a high-resource language into a low-resource one, thereby constructing pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. Then, we train a POS tagger for the target language following the standard projection procedure based on word alignments. Moreover, we propose a multi-source projection technique to calibrate the projected POS tags on the target side, enhancing to train a more effective POS tagger. We evaluate our framework on 28 language pairs, covering four source languages (English, German, Spanish and French) and seven target languages (Afrikaans, Basque, Finnis, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Turkish). Experimental results show that our method can achieve performance comparable to the baseline cross-lingual POS tagger with parallel sentence pairs, and even exceeds it for certain target languages.

Existing lane change controllers primarily either ensure safety or collaboratively improve traffic efficiency, but do not consider these conflicting objectives together. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), designed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable safe and collaborative lane changes. The MASS enables collaboration by capturing multi-agent interactions among CAVs through interaction topologies constructed as a graph using a simple algorithm. Further, a state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lane change controller is extended by integrating MASS to ensure safety and defining a customised reward function to prioritise efficiency improvements. As a result, we propose a lane change controller, known as MARL-MASS, and evaluate it in a congested on-ramp merging simulation. The results demonstrate that MASS enables collaborative lane changes with safety guarantees by strictly respecting the safety constraints. Moreover, the proposed custom reward function improves the stability of MARL policies trained with a safety shield. Overall, by encouraging the exploration of a collaborative lane change policy while respecting safety constraints, MARL-MASS effectively balances the trade-off between ensuring safety and improving traffic efficiency in congested traffic.

We show that neural retrievers used in RAG systems have blind spots, which we define as the failure to retrieve entities that are relevant to the query, but have low similarity to the query embedding. We investigate the training-induced biases that cause such blind spot entities to be mapped to inaccessible parts of the embedding space, resulting in low retrievability. Using a large-scale dataset constructed from Wikidata relations and first paragraphs of Wikipedia, and our proposed Retrieval Probability Score (RPS), we show that blind spot risk in standard retrievers (e.g., CONTRIEVER, REASONIR) can be predicted pre-index from entity embedding geometry, avoiding expensive retrieval evaluations. To address these blind spots, we introduce ARGUS, a pipeline that enables the retrievability of high-risk (low-RPS) entities through targeted document augmentation from a knowledge base (KB), first paragraphs of Wikipedia, in our case. Extensive experiments on BRIGHT, IMPLIRET, and RAR-B show that ARGUS achieves consistent improvements across all evaluated retrievers (averaging +3.4 nDCG@5 and +4.5 nDCG@10 absolute points), with substantially larger gains in challenging subsets.

This study introduces a hybrid risk-aware navigation architecture that integrates probabilistic modeling of obstacles along the vehicle path with smooth trajectory optimization for autonomous surface vessels. The system constructs probabilistic risk maps that capture both obstacle proximity and the behavior of dynamic objects. A risk-biased Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner leverages these maps to generate collision-free paths, which are subsequently refined using B-spline algorithms to ensure trajectory continuity. Three distinct RRT* rewiring modes are implemented based on the cost function: minimizing the path length, minimizing risk, and optimizing a combination of the path length and total risk. The framework is evaluated in experimental scenarios containing both static and dynamic obstacles. The results demonstrate the system's ability to navigate safely, maintain smooth trajectories, and dynamically adapt to changing environmental risks.

However, existing Mamba-based architectures often struggle with datasets characterized by non-stationary patterns. A key observation from time series theory is that the statistical nature of inter-variable relationships differs fundamentally between the trend and seasonal components of a decomposed series. Trend relationships are often driven by a few common stochastic factors or long-run equilibria, suggesting that they reside on a lower-dimensional manifold. In contrast, seasonal relationships involve dynamic, high-dimensional interactions like phase shifts and amplitude co-movements, requiring more expressive modeling. In this paper, we propose DMamba, a novel forecasting model that explicitly aligns architectural complexity with this component-specific characteristic. DMamba employs seasonal-trend decomposition and processes the components with specialized, differentially complex modules: a variable-direction Mamba encoder captures the rich, cross-variable dynamics within the seasonal component, while a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) suffices to learn from the lower-dimensional inter-variable relationships in the trend component. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that DMamba sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), consistently outperforming both recent Mamba-based architectures and leading decomposition-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDMamba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b63\u8282-\u8d8b\u52bf\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u5206\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u5411Mamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u5b63\u8282\u6210\u5206\uff0cMLP\u5904\u7406\u8d8b\u52bf\u6210\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u800c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u6210\u5206\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDMamba\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u5b63\u8282-\u8d8b\u52bf\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u518d\u5206\u522b\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u5411Mamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5b63\u8282\u6210\u5206\uff09\u548c\u7b80\u5355MLP\uff08\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8d8b\u52bf\u6210\u5206\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDMamba\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u7684Mamba\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u4e3b\u6d41\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We propose a novel approach that grounds text-to-image synthesis within the framework of scene graph structures, aiming to enhance the compositional abilities of existing models. Eventhough, prior approaches have attempted to address this by using pre-defined layout maps derived from prompts, such rigid constraints often limit compositional flexibility and diversity. In contrast, we introduce a zero-shot, scene graph-based conditioning mechanism that generates soft visual guidance during inference. At the core of our method is the Attribute-Size-Quantity-Location (ASQL) Conditioner, which produces visual conditions via a lightweight language model and guides diffusion-based generation through inference-time optimization.

We present a comparative analysis of two newly active Reddit communities in Jan--Feb 2026 that reflect different socio-technical roles: r/OpenClaw (deployment and operations) and r/Moltbook (agent-centered social interaction). We conceptualize this period as an early-stage crystallization phase, where oversight expectations form before norms reach equilibrium.\n  Using topic modeling in a shared comparison space, a coarse-grained oversight-theme abstraction, engagement-weighted salience, and divergence tests, we show the communities are strongly separable (JSD =0.418, cosine =0.372, permutation $p=0.0005$). Across both communities, \"human control\" is an anchor term, but its operational meaning diverges: r/OpenClaw} emphasizes execution guardrails and recovery (action-risk), while r/Moltbook} emphasizes identity, legitimacy, and accountability in public interaction (meaning-risk). The resulting distinction offers a portable lens for designing and evaluating oversight mechanisms that match agent role, rather than applying one-size-fits-all control policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u5174Reddit\u793e\u533a\uff08r/OpenClaw\u548cr/Moltbook\uff09\u57282026\u5e74\u521d\u5bf9\u5177\u8eabAI\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u4ee5\u201c\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a7\u5236\u201d\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5177\u4f53\u542b\u4e49\u4f9dAI\u89d2\u8272\u800c\u5f02\uff1a\u524d\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u6267\u884c\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u4e0e\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\uff09\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u610f\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u540c\u3001\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5171\u95ee\u8d23\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u9002\u914d\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53cd\u5bf9\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u5177\u8eabAI\u90e8\u7f72\u5df2\u50ac\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u89d2\u8272\u4e0b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u76d1\u7ba1\u671f\u5f85\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8ba8\u8bba\u5e38\u5c06\u2018\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a7\u5236\u2019\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u89d2\u8272\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8de8\u793e\u533a\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u52a0\u6743\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u68c0\u9a8c\uff08JSD\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001\u7f6e\u6362\u68c0\u9a8c\uff09\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2aReddit\u793e\u533a\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u8bdd\u8bed\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u793e\u533a\u76d1\u7ba1\u8bdd\u8bed\u663e\u8457\u53ef\u5206\uff08JSD=0.418\uff0c\u4f59\u5f26=0.372\uff0cp=0.0005\uff09\uff1b\u2018\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a7\u5236\u2019\u5728r/OpenClaw\u4e2d\u6307\u5411\u884c\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u6267\u884c\u5b88\u536b\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\uff09\uff0c\u5728r/Moltbook\u4e2d\u6307\u5411\u610f\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5171\u95ee\u8d23\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u4f9d\u636eAI\u6240\u5904\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u89d2\u8272\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7edf\u4e00\u9002\u7528\u2018\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a7\u5236\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u62bd\u8c61\u539f\u5219\uff1b\u8be5\u89d2\u8272\u9002\u914d\u89c6\u89d2\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet existing approaches often rely on deterministic latent chains that accumulate noise and overlook the uncertainty inherent in user intent, and they are typically trained in staged pipelines that hinder joint optimization and exploration. To address these challenges, we propose DiffuReason, a unified \"Think-then-Diffuse\" framework for sequential recommendation. It integrates multi-step Thinking Tokens for latent reasoning, diffusion-based refinement for denoising intermediate representations, and end-to-end Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) alignment to optimize for ranking performance. In the Think stage, the model generates Thinking Tokens that reason over user history to form an initial intent hypothesis. In the Diffuse stage, rather than treating this hypothesis as the final output, we refine it through a diffusion process that models user intent as a probabilistic distribution, providing iterative denoising against reasoning noise. Finally, GRPO-based reinforcement learning enables the reasoning and refinement modules to co-evolve throughout training, without the constraints of staged optimization. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that DiffuReason consistently improves diverse backbone architectures.

A legible trajectory allows an observer to quickly and accurately predict an agent's intention. In adversarial environments, such as in military operations or games, it is important for a robot to not communicate its intentions to observers. An illegible trajectory leads an observer to incorrectly predict the agent's intention or delays when an observer is able to make a correct prediction about the agent's intention. However, in some environments there are multiple observers, each of whom may be able to see only part of the environment, and each of whom may have different motives. In this work, we introduce the Mixed-Motive Limited-Observability Legible Motion Planning (MMLO-LMP) problem, which requires a motion planner to generate a trajectory that is legible to observers with positive motives and illegible to observers with negative motives while also considering the visibility limitations of each observer.

We evaluated the feasibility of forecasting the anterior-posterior (AP) foot center-of-pressure (COP) and time-of-impact (TOI) prior to foot-strike on a level-ground to stair-ascent transition. Eight subjects wore an RGB-D camera on their right shank and instrumented insoles while performing the task of stepping onto the stairs. We trained a CNN-RNN to forecast the COP and TOI continuously within a 250ms window prior to foot-strike, termed the forecast horizon (FH). The COP mean-absolute-error (MAE) at 150, 100, and 50ms FH was 29.42mm, 26.82, and 23.72mm respectively. The TOI MAE was 21.14, 20.08, and 17.73ms for 150, 100, and 50ms respectively. While torso velocity had no effect on the error in either task, faster toe-swing speeds prior to foot-strike were found to improve the prediction accuracy in the COP case, however, was insignificant in the TOI case. Further, more anterior foot-strikes were found to reduce COP prediction accuracy but did not affect the TOI prediction accuracy. We also found that our lightweight model was capable at running at 60 FPS on either a consumer grade laptop or an edge computing device. This study demonstrates that forecasting COP and TOI from visual data was feasible using a lightweight model, which may have important implications for anticipatory control in assistive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eRGB-D\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN-RNN\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b65\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\uff08\u5e73\u5730\u2192\u4e0a\u697c\u68af\uff09\u524d\u8db3\u5e95\u538b\u529b\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08COP\uff09\u4e0e\u89e6\u5730\u65f6\u523b\uff08TOI\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728250ms\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u57df\u5185\u53d6\u5f97\u6beb\u7c73/\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7528\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u8f85\u52a9\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8db3\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u5730\u8f6c\u697c\u68af\uff09\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u5c11\u5bf9\u8db3\u5e95\u538b\u529b\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08COP\uff09\u548c\u89e6\u5730\u65f6\u523b\uff08TOI\uff09\u7684\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f69\u6234\u4e8e\u53f3\u5c0f\u817f\u7684RGB-D\u76f8\u673a\u4e0e\u8db3\u5e95\u538b\u529b\u978b\u57ab\u91c7\u96c68\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4ece\u5e73\u5730\u8fc8\u6b65\u4e0a\u697c\u68af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u6784\u5efaCNN-RNN\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u89e6\u5730\u524d250ms\u7a97\u53e3\uff08forecast horizon, FH\uff09\u5185\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u6d4bAP\u65b9\u5411COP\u548cTOI\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u6b65\u6001\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u8eaf\u5e72\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8dbe\u6446\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8db3\u7740\u5730\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u6027\u80fd\uff08FPS\uff09\u3002", "result": "COP\u9884\u6d4bMAE\u5728150/100/50ms FH\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u4e3a29.42/26.82/23.72 mm\uff1bTOI\u9884\u6d4bMAE\u4e3a21.14/20.08/17.73 ms\uff1b\u8dbe\u6446\u901f\u5ea6\u8d8a\u5feb\uff0cCOP\u9884\u6d4b\u8d8a\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u8eaf\u5e72\u901f\u5ea6\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u66f4\u9760\u524d\u7684\u7740\u5730\u70b9\u964d\u4f4eCOP\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f46\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cdTOI\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fbe60 FPS\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c0f\u817f\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cfCNN-RNN\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u6001\u53c2\u6570\uff08COP\u4e0eTOI\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u5047\u80a2\u3001\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u7b49\u52a9\u884c\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u524d\u9988\u5f0f/\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing diversity metrics, such as feature-space dispersion and metric-space magnitude, primarily capture distributional variation or entropy, while largely neglecting the geometric structure of datasets.

This approach provides a theoretically grounded means of measuring diversity beyond entropy, capturing the rich geometric and structural properties of datasets.

However, effectively integrating these capabilities with collaborative signals while avoiding prohibitive inference latency remains a critical bottleneck. To address this, we propose a trajectory-driven internalization framework to develop a Single-agent Trajectory-Aligned Recommender (STAR). Specifically, to internalize complex reasoning capabilities into a single efficient model, we first design a multi-agent teacher system capable of multi-turn tool usage and reflection. This teacher utilizes a Collaborative Signal Translation mechanism to explicitly convert latent behavioral patterns into descriptive natural language evidence to enhance reasoning accuracy. Subsequently, a trajectory-driven distillation pipeline transfers this agentic logic, including planning, tool usage, and self-reflection, into the compact STAR model.

We present STaR, an agentic reasoning framework that (i) constructs a task-agnostic, multimodal long-term memory that generalizes to unseen queries while preserving fine-grained environmental semantics (object attributes, spatial relations, and dynamic events), and (ii) introduces a Scalable TaskConditioned Retrieval algorithm based on the Information Bottleneck principle to extract from long-term memory a compact, non-redundant, information-rich set of candidate memories for contextual reasoning. We evaluate STaR on NaVQA (mixed indoor/outdoor campus scenes) and WH-VQA, a customized warehouse benchmark with many visually similar objects built with Isaac Sim, emphasizing contextual reasoning.

This paper offers a comprehensive review of collective operations and distributed parallel strategies, complemented by mathematical formulations to deepen theoretical understanding. We further examine hybrid parallelization designs, emphasizing communication computation overlap across different stages of model deployment, including both training and inference.

A central challenge is to localize uncertainty to its source, determining whether it arises from the image, the text, or misalignment between the two. We introduce VLM-UQBench, a benchmark for modality-specific and cross-modal data uncertainty in VLMs, It consists of 600 real-world samples drawn from the VizWiz dataset, curated into clean, image-, text-, and cross-modal uncertainty subsets, and a scalable perturbation pipeline with 8 visual, 5 textual, and 3 cross-modal perturbations. We further propose two simple metrics that quantify the sensitivity of UQ scores to these perturbations and their correlation with hallucinations, and use them to evaluate a range of UQ methods across four VLMs and three datasets. Empirically, we find that: (i) existing UQ methods exhibit strong modality-specific specialization and substantial dependence on the underlying VLM, (ii) modality-specific uncertainty frequently co-occurs with hallucinations while current UQ scores provide only weak and inconsistent risk signals, and (iii) although UQ methods can rival reasoning-based chain-of-thought baselines on overt, group-level ambiguity, they largely fail to detect the subtle, instance-level ambiguity introduced by our perturbation pipeline. These results highlight a significant gap between current UQ practices and the fine-grained, modality-aware uncertainty required for reliable VLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VLM-UQBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6270\u52a8\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u6765\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dUQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6216\u56fe\u6587\u9519\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9VLM\u4e2d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaVLM-UQBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b600\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u53ca\u4e09\u7c7b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542b8\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u30015\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u30013\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6270\u52a8\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cdUQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2aVLM\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\uff08i\uff09UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e95\u5c42VLM\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dUQ\u5f97\u5206\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fae\u5f31\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u660e\u663e\u6b67\u4e49\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5374\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7ec6\u5fae\u6b67\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dUQ\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0eVLM\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A core challenge it faces is bias, which has primarily been studied in terms of known biases and their impact on evaluation outcomes, while automated and systematic exploration of potential unknown biases is still lacking. Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation. BiasScope can uncover potential biases across different model families and scales, with its generality and effectiveness validated on the JudgeBench dataset. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, transforming bias discovery from a passive process relying on manual effort and predefined bias lists into an active and comprehensive automated exploration. Moreover, based on BiasScope, we propose JudgeBench-Pro, an extended version of JudgeBench and a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLM-as-a-judge.

Traditional QP systems rely on pipelines of isolated discriminative models (e.g., BERT), suffering from limited semantic understanding and high maintenance overhead. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential solution, existing approaches often optimize sub-tasks in isolation, neglecting intrinsic semantic synergy and necessitating independent iterations. Moreover, standard generative methods often lack grounding in SNS scenarios, failing to bridge the gap between open-domain corpora and informal SNS linguistic patterns, while struggling to adhere to rigorous business definitions. We present QP-OneModel, a Unified Generative LLM for Multi-Task Query Understanding in the SNS domain. We reformulate heterogeneous sub-tasks into a unified sequence generation paradigm, adopting a progressive three-stage alignment strategy culminating in multi-reward Reinforcement Learning. Furthermore, QP-OneModel generates intent descriptions as a novel high-fidelity semantic signal, effectively augmenting downstream tasks such as query rewriting and ranking. Offline evaluations show QP-OneModel achieves a 7.35% overall gain over discriminative baselines, with significant F1 boosts in NER (+9.01%) and Term Weighting (+9.31%). It also exhibits superior generalization, surpassing a 32B model by 7.60% accuracy on unseen tasks.

However, operative expert gaze is costly to collect, and it remains unclear how the source of gaze supervision, both expertise level (intermediate vs. novice) and perceptual modality (active execution vs. passive viewing), shapes what attention models learn. We introduce a paired active-passive, multi-task surgical gaze dataset collected on the da Vinci SimNow simulator across four drills. Active gaze was recorded during task execution using a VR headset with eye tracking, and the corresponding videos were reused as stimuli to collect passive gaze from observers, enabling controlled same-video comparisons. We quantify skill- and modality-dependent differences in gaze organization and evaluate the substitutability of passive gaze for operative supervision using fixation density overlap analyses and single-frame saliency modeling. Across settings, MSI-Net produced stable, interpretable predictions, whereas SalGAN was unstable and often poorly aligned with human fixations. Models trained on passive gaze recovered a substantial portion of intermediate active attention, but with predictable degradation, and transfer was asymmetric between active and passive targets. Notably, novice passive labels approximated intermediate-passive targets with limited loss on higher-quality demonstrations, suggesting a practical path for scalable, crowd-sourced gaze supervision in surgical coaching and perception modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8-\u88ab\u52a8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5916\u79d1\u6ce8\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u4e2d\u7ea7 vs. \u65b0\u624b\uff09\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u4e3b\u52a8\u6267\u884c vs. \u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u770b\uff09\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u88ab\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\u53ef\u90e8\u5206\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e3b\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u65b0\u624b\u88ab\u52a8\u6807\u7b7e\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e2d\u7ea7\u88ab\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5916\u79d1\u6559\u5b66\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e13\u5bb6\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u4f46\u672f\u4e2d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u6ce8\u89c6\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728da Vinci SimNow\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u4e3b\u52a8-\u88ab\u52a8\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5916\u79d1\u6ce8\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9879\u76ee\uff1b\u4e3b\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\u5728VR\u5934\u663e\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u540c\u6b65\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u89c6\u9891\u518d\u7528\u4e8e\u91c7\u96c6\u88ab\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u89c6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5355\u5e27\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce8\u89c6\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "MSI-Net\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0cSalGAN\u5219\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5e38\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ce8\u89c6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u88ab\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u7ea7\u4e3b\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u88ab\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff1b\u65b0\u624b\u88ab\u52a8\u6807\u7b7e\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u53ef\u8f83\u597d\u903c\u8fd1\u4e2d\u7ea7\u88ab\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u88ab\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65b0\u624b\u88ab\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\uff09\u53ef\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u6ce8\u89c6\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5916\u79d1\u6559\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u624b\u672f\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We evaluate different variations of our wrapper on multiple machine learning models against a negation adversarial dataset. Experimental results highlight the improvement of hybrid (formal reasoning and machine-learning) methods against various purely statistical solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5305\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1/\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u903b\u8f91\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5982\u5426\u5b9a\u4fee\u9970\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u5957\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5426\u5b9a\u5bf9\u6297\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6bd2\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6548\u80fd\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5426\u5b9a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law. LLMs seem to be able to generate generic and superficially plausible contractual documents. In the cold light of day, such documents may turn out to be useless assemblages of inconsistent provisions or contracts that are enforceable but unsuitable for a given transaction.

However, in the initial retrieval stage, practitioners face an inherent tradeoff between embedding expressiveness and the scalability and latency of serving components, resulting in the need for representations that are both compact and expressive. To address this challenge, we propose a training strategy for learning high-dimensional sparse embedding layers in place of conventional dense ones, balancing efficiency, representational expressiveness, and interpretability. To demonstrate our approach, we modified the production-grade collaborative filtering autoencoder ELSA, achieving up to 10x reduction in embedding size with no loss of recommendation accuracy, and up to 100x reduction with only a 2.5% loss. Moreover, the active embedding dimensions reveal an interpretable inverted-index structure that segments items in a way directly aligned with the model's latent space, thereby enabling integration of segment-level recommendation functionality (e.g., 2D homepage layouts) within the candidate retrieval model itself.

In anomaly detection tasks, models guided by these principles achieve significant performance gains - exhibiting a 56\\% relative improvement in decision stability under extreme noise - over traditional baselines. These results provide evidence for a shared organizational signature across heterogeneous domains, establishing a principled paradigm for cross-disciplinary knowledge propagation. By shifting from opaque latent representations to explicit structural laws, this work advances machine learning as a robust engine for scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff08X-CDTL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff08IIT\uff09\u673a\u5236\u8bc6\u522b\u8de8\u751f\u7269\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5f3a\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534756%\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6781\u5ea6\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u5dee\u5f02\u6781\u5927\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff1b\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u8de8\u57df\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u539f\u7406\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faX-CDTL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff08IIT\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u951a\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5f3a\u4f46\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534756%\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u9886\u57df\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7b7e\u540d\u3002", "conclusion": "X-CDTL\u4e3a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u64ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u9ed1\u7bb1\u9690\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u5411\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, recent approaches discard modulation-based text conditioning and rely exclusively on attention. In this paper, we address whether modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it can provide any performance advantage. Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties. This approach is training-free, simple to implement, incurs negligible runtime overhead, and can be applied to various diffusion models, bringing improvements across diverse tasks, including text-to-image/video generation and image editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u6c60\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u8d21\u732e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u82e5\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u5219\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6c60\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u4e0e\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6c60\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u8d21\u732e\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u7528\u6cd5\u4e2d\u975e\u5fc5\u9700\uff0c\u4f46\u6362\u4f5c\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u540e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses randomly initialized expanded vocabulary for continued pre-training, in POS tagging and NER tasks, achieving improvements by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively.

Such conditions greatly challenge end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models, whose assumptions of recoverable errors and data-driven policy learning often break down in protocol-sensitive experiments. We propose CAPER, a framework for Constrained And ProcEdural Reasoning for robotic scientific experiments, which explicitly restricts where learning and reasoning occur in the planning and control pipeline. Rather than strengthening end-to-end policies, CAPER enforces a responsibility-separated structure: task-level reasoning generates procedurally valid action sequences under explicit constraints, mid-level multimodal grounding realizes subtasks without delegating spatial decision-making to large language models, and low-level control adapts to physical uncertainty via reinforcement learning with minimal demonstrations. By encoding procedural commitments through interpretable intermediate representations, CAPER prevents execution-time violations of experimental logic, improving controllability, robustness, and data efficiency.

Small variations in solution or operating conditions can shift the jet regime, generating non Gaussian fiber diameter distributions. Despite substantial progress, no existing framework enables inverse design toward desired fiber outcomes while integrating polymer solvent chemical constraints or predicting full distributions. SpinCastML is an open source, distribution aware, chemically informed machine learning and Inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) software for inverse electrospinning design. Built on a rigorously curated dataset of 68,480 fiber diameters from 1,778 datasets across 16 polymers, SpinCastML integrates three structured sampling methods, a suite of 11 high-performance learners, and chemistry aware constraints to predict not only mean diameter but the entire distribution. Cubist model with a polymer balanced Sobol D optimal sampling provides the highest global performance (R2 > 0.92). IMC accurately captures the fiber distributions, achieving R2 > 0.90 and <1% error between predicted and experimental success rates. The IMC engine supports both retrospective analysis and forward-looking inverse design, generating physically and chemically feasible polymer solvent parameter combinations with quantified success probabilities for user-defined targets. SpinCastML reframes electrospinning from trial and error to a reproducible, data driven design process. As an open source executable, it enables laboratories to analyze their own datasets and co create an expanding community software.

Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability.

Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks.

Existing moral benchmarks prompt LLMs with value statements, moral scenarios, or psychological questionnaires, with the implicit underlying assumption that LLMs report somewhat stable moral preferences. However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this \"situationist\" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 \"moral distractors\" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d7\u9053\u5fb7\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u60c5\u5883\u4e3b\u4e49\u89c2\u70b9\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u662f\u5426\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u53d7\u65e0\u5173\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e8660\u4e2a\u65e0\u9053\u5fb7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u2018\u9053\u5fb7\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u2019\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u53ef\u4f7fLLM\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u504f\u79fb\u8d8530%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u51c6\u5047\u8bbeLLM\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u6613\u53d7\u65e0\u5173\u60c5\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u68c0\u9a8cLLM\u662f\u5426\u540c\u6837\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8ba4\u77e5\u9053\u5fb7\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5fc3\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7b5b\u900960\u4e2a\u60c5\u611f\u5316\u3001\u65e0\u9053\u5fb7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u53d9\u4e8b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u2018\u9053\u5fb7\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u2019\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6ce8\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9LLM\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u9053\u5fb7\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8LLM\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6b67\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u504f\u79fb\u5e45\u5ea6\u8d8530%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u9053\u5fb7\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Smoothing the dynamics yields continuous gradients, but the resulting model mismatch can cause controller failures when executed on real systems. We address this trade-off by planning with smoothed dynamics while explicitly quantifying and compensating for the induced errors, providing formal guarantees of constraint satisfaction and goal reachability on the true hybrid dynamics. Our method smooths both contact dynamics and geometry via a novel differentiable simulator based on convex optimization, which enables us to characterize the discrepancy from the true dynamics as a set-valued deviation. This deviation constrains the optimization of time-varying affine feedback policies through analytical bounds on the system's reachable set, enabling robust constraint satisfaction guarantees for the true closed-loop hybrid dynamics, while relying solely on informative gradients from the smoothed dynamics. We evaluate our method on several contact-rich tasks, including planar pushing, object rotation, and in-hand dexterous manipulation, achieving guaranteed constraint satisfaction with lower safety violation and goal error than baselines. By bridging differentiable physics with set-valued robust control, our method is the first certifiable gradient-based policy synthesis method for contact-rich manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u6ed1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u8865\u507f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u771f\u5b9e\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u6ed1\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6216\u6d88\u5931\uff1b\u800c\u5355\u7eaf\u5e73\u6ed1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u53ef\u5fae\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u96c6\u5408\u503c\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u65f6\u53d8\u4eff\u5c04\u53cd\u9988\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65bd\u52a0\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u8fbe\u96c6\u8fb9\u754c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u63a8\u6324\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u5185\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u95ed\u73af\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u3001\u5177\u5907\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c bridging \u53ef\u5fae\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u96c6\u5408\u503c\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

This creates a decoder-side bottleneck: downstream decision-makers must form reliable posteriors from many public records under scarce attention. We formalize this regime via Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), in which a cheap screening stage processes $K$ records and an expensive verification stage can follow up on at most $B$ of them. Under Bayes log-loss, we study the maximum achievable reduction in posterior uncertainty per window, which we call \\emph{epistemic throughput}. Our main result is a ``JaKoB'' scaling law showing that epistemic throughput has a baseline term that grows linearly with verification and prevalence, and an additional \\emph{information-leverage} term that scales as $\\sqrt{JKB}$, where $J$ summarizes screening quality. Thus, expanding cheap screening can nonlinearly amplify scarce verification, even when informative records are rare.

Most patients do not acquire a wound which needs immediate hospitalization. However, due to factors such as delay in treatment, patient's non-compliance or existing co-morbid conditions, an injury can deteriorate and ultimately lead to patient hospitalization. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal method to predict the patient's risk of hospitalization. Our goal is to predict the risk confidently by collectively using the wound variables and wound images of the patient. Existing works in this domain have mainly focused on healing trajectories based on distinct wound types. We developed a transfer learning-based wound assessment solution, which can predict both wound variables from wound images and their healing trajectories, which is our primary contribution.

Previous approaches, bound by internal knowledge, often fail to provide verifiable results, yielding confident but ungrounded predictions when faced with confounded evidence. To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise.

However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks.

For tree ensembles, predictions are piecewise constant over a large collection of axis-aligned hyperrectangles, implying that an optimal counterfactual for a point corresponds to its projection onto the nearest rectangle with an alternative label under a chosen metric. Existing methods largely overlook this geometric structure, relying either on heuristics with no optimality guarantees or on mixed-integer programming formulations that do not scale to interactive use.\n  In this work, we revisit counterfactual generation through the lens of nearest-region search and introduce counterfactual maps, a global representation of recourse for tree ensembles. Leveraging the fact that any tree ensemble can be compressed into an equivalent partition of labeled hyperrectangles, we cast counterfactual search as the problem of identifying the generalized Voronoi cell associated with the nearest rectangle of an alternative label. This leads to an exact, amortized algorithm based on volumetric k-dimensional (KD) trees, which performs branch-and-bound nearest-region queries with explicit optimality certificates and sublinear average query time after a one-time preprocessing phase.\n  Our experimental analyses on several real datasets drawn from high-stakes application domains show that this approach delivers globally optimal counterfactual explanations with millisecond-level latency, achieving query times that are orders of magnitude faster than existing exact, cold-start optimization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56fe\uff08counterfactual maps\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3a\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u5229\u7528KD\u6811\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff08\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d85\u77e9\u5f62\u4e0a\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8d85\u77e9\u5f62\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u628a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u641c\u7d22\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u5f02\u6807\u53f7\u6700\u8fd1\u8d85\u77e9\u5f62\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49Voronoi\u5355\u5143\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u79efKD\u6811\u7684\u5206\u652f\u9650\u754c\u6700\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u644a\u9500\u5f0f\u5feb\u901f\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u8bc1\u4e66\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5185\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u672c\u8d28\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56fe\u4e0e\u4f53\u79efKD\u6811\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u843d\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RAG\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u53cd\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u5f15\u53d1\u4e25\u91cd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u867d\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u76f8\u540c\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30RAG\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3001LLM\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d613\u79cd\u4ee5\u4e0a\u504f\u89c1\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u878d\u5165RAG\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "RAG\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6291\u5236\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u4f46\u52a0\u5165CoT\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u53cd\u800c\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u504f\u89c1\u503e\u5411\u968f\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u591a\u5728\u523b\u677f\u4e0e\u53cd\u523b\u677f\u54cd\u5e94\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u5177\u6709\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46CoT\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Cosine similarity is prevalent in contrastive learning, yet it makes an implicit assumption: embedding magnitude is noise. Prior work occasionally found dot product and cosine similarity comparable, but left unanswered WHAT information magnitude carries, WHEN it helps, and HOW to leverage it. We conduct a systematic study through a $2 \\times 2$ ablation that independently controls input-side and output-side normalization across text and vision models. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, in text retrieval, output (document) magnitude strongly correlates with relevance (Cohen's $d$ up to 1.80), yielding the largest gains on reasoning-intensive tasks. Second, input and output magnitudes serve asymmetric roles: output magnitude directly scales similarity scores while input magnitude modulates training dynamics. Third, magnitude learning benefits asymmetric tasks (text retrieval, RAG) but harms symmetric tasks (STS, text-image alignment). These findings establish a task symmetry principle: the choice between cosine and dot product depends on whether the task has distinct input roles, enabling cost-free improvements by simply removing an unnecessary constraint.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u6a21\u957f\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5e76\u975e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u643a\u5e26\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u6587\u6863\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff09\uff1b\u6a21\u957f\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u4fa7\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u4fa7\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u539f\u5219\u2019\u6307\u5bfc\u4f55\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u70b9\u79ef\u6216\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u957f\u662f\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u9610\u660e\u6a21\u957f\u5b9e\u9645\u627f\u8f7d\u4ec0\u4e48\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u6709\u7528\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc72\u00d72\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8f93\u5165\u4fa7\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u4fa7\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u957f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u7aef\u6a21\u957f\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08Cohen's d\u8fbe1.80\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u8f93\u5165/\u8f93\u51fa\u6a21\u957f\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff1a\u524d\u8005\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\uff1b3\uff09\u6a21\u957f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u3001RAG\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u635f\u5bb3\u5bf9\u79f0\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982STS\u3001\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u957f\u8574\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u7b80\u5355\u4e22\u5f03\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u53bb\u9664\u6a21\u957f\u7ea6\u675f\u2014\u2014\u8be5\u539f\u5219\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6210\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for robotic laboratories. However, scientific experiments typically involve long-horizon tasks composed of multiple atomic tasks, posing a fundamental challenge to existing VLA models. While VLA models fine-tuned for scientific tasks can reliably execute atomic experimental actions seen during training, they often fail to perform composite tasks formed by reordering and composing these known atomic actions. This limitation arises from a distributional mismatch between training-time atomic tasks and inference-time composite tasks, which prevents VLA models from executing necessary transitional operations between atomic tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an Agentic VLA Inference Plugin for Long-Horizon Tasks in Scientific Experiments. It introduces an LLM-based agentic inference mechanism that intervenes when executing sequential manipulation tasks. By performing explicit transition inference and generating transitional robotic action code, the proposed plugin guides VLA models through missing transitional steps, enabling reliable execution of composite scientific workflows without any additional training. This inference-only intervention makes our method computationally efficient, data-efficient, and well-suited for open-ended and long-horizon robotic laboratory tasks. We build 3D assets of scientific instruments and common scientific operating scenes within an existing simulation environment. In these scenes, we have verified that our method increases the average success rate per atomic task by 42\\% during inference. Furthermore, we show that our method can be easily transferred from the simulation to real scientific laboratories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Agentic VLA\u63a8\u7406\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u8fc7\u6e21\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u6e21\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5468\u671f\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u6267\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7531\u5df2\u77e5\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u91cd\u7ec4\u6784\u6210\u7684\u590d\u5408\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u56e0\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f3a\u5931\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0fVLA\u63a8\u7406\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u8be5\u63d2\u4ef6\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4ecb\u5165\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u6e21\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u6e21\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u5bfcVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u590d\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u6574\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u76843D\u79d1\u5b66\u4eea\u5668\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u539f\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534742%\uff1b\u4e14\u53ef\u8f7b\u677e\u4ece\u4eff\u771f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u63a8\u7406\u63d2\u4ef6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u4e0e\u957f\u5468\u671f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u79d1\u7814\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Through extensive evaluation of six compression techniques on modern LLMs across more than 40 datasets, we find that (i) compression exhibits a consistent knowledge bias, where knowledge-intensive tasks are relatively preserved while reasoning, multilingual, and instruction-following capabilities degrade substantially; (ii) quantization provides the best overall trade-off between retained performance and efficiency, whereas distillation yields strong runtime acceleration gains at high computational cost; and (iii) task-specific calibration can significantly improve the reasoning ability of pruned models by up to 50%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UniComp\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff08\u526a\u679d\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6743\u8861\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u6821\u51c6\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u538b\u7f29\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5168\uff0c\u4e14\u8fc7\u5ea6\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u7b49\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniComp\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u526a\u679d\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e09\u7c7b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u572840+\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ece\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\uff09\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff08\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff08\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6790\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\uff08i\uff09\u538b\u7f29\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u504f\u5dee\uff1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4fdd\u7559\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u6027\u80fd-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u867d\u52a0\u901f\u660e\u663e\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u4f7f\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe50%\u3002", "conclusion": "UniComp\u4e3aLLM\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6743\u8861\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u6821\u51c6\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, these models may not be similar in medical imaging, where abnormal regions cover only a small portion of the image. This challenge motivates this study to investigate the latest deep models for bladder cancer classification tasks. We propose the following to evaluate these deep models: 1) standard classification using 13 models (four CNNs and eight transormer-based models), 2) calibration analysis to examine if these models are well calibrated for bladder cancer classification, and 3) we use GradCAM++ to evaluate the interpretability of these models for clinical diagnosis. We simulate $\\sim 300$ experiments on a publicly multicenter bladder cancer dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the ConvNext series indicate limited generalization ability to classify bladder cancer images (e.g., $\\sim 60\\%$ accuracy). In addition, ViTs show better calibration effects compared to ConvNext and swin transformer series. We also involve test time augmentation to improve the models interpretability. Finally, no model provides a one-size-fits-all solution for a feasible interpretable model. ConvNext series are suitable for in-distribution samples, while ViT and its variants are suitable for interpreting out-of-distribution samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8613\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff084\u79cdCNN\u548c8\u79cdTransformer\uff09\u5728\u8180\u80f1\u764c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ConvNeXt\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0cViT\u7cfb\u5217\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u548cOOD\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800cConvNeXt\u66f4\u9002\u5408ID\u6837\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u7684ViT\u548cCNN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\uff08\u5982\u8180\u80f1\u764c\uff09\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5f02\u5e38\u533a\u57df\u5360\u6bd4\u5c0f\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f3013\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b3\uff09GradCAM++\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b4\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b5\uff09\u5728\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u516c\u5f00\u8180\u80f1\u764c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u7ea6300\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "ConvNeXt\u7cfb\u5217\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u7ea660%\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff1bViT\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eConvNeXt\u548cSwin\uff1b\u65e0\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u6240\u6709\u9700\u6c42\uff1aConvNeXt\u9002\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6837\u672c\uff0cViT\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u4f9d\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u9700\u6c42\uff1a\u5f3a\u8c03ID\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\u53ef\u9009ConvNeXt\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0eOOD\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65f6\u63a8\u8350ViT\u7cfb\u5217\u3002"}}

Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime.

Accepted at the First Workshop on Multilingual Multicultural Evaluation (MME) @ EACL 2026", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multicultural settings; however, systematic evaluation of cultural specificity at the sentence level remains underexplored. We propose the Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI), which estimates cultural specificity at the sentence level. CCI is defined as the difference between the generality estimate within the target culture and the average generality estimate across other cultures. This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones. For binary separability, CCI outperforms direct LLM scoring, yielding more than a 10-point improvement in AUC for models specialized to the target culture.

Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure.

Formal methods like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offer correctness and optimal guarantees, but are typically confined to static, offline settings and struggle with computational scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning into hierarchical LTL specifications and solves the corresponding Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning (STAP) problem. Unlike static approaches, our system resolves stochastic environmental changes, such as moving users or updated instructions via a receding horizon planning (RHP) loop with real-time perception, which dynamically refines plans through a hierarchical state space.

This is especially true in cases where external ground truth is not readily available to validate model outputs. This situation has motivated the study of geometric signals in the internal state of an LLM that are predictive of hallucination and require limited external knowledge. Given that there are a range of factors that can lead model output to be called a hallucination (e.g., irrelevance vs incoherence), in this paper we ask what specific properties of a hallucination these geometric statistics actually capture. To assess this, we generate a synthetic dataset which varies distinct properties of output associated with hallucination. This includes output correctness, confidence, relevance, coherence, and completeness. We find that different geometric statistics capture different types of hallucinations. Along the way we show that many existing geometric detection methods have substantial sensitivity to shifts in task domain (e.g., math questions vs. history questions). Motivated by this, we introduce a simple normalization method to mitigate the effect of domain shift on geometric statistics, leading to AUROC gains of +34 points in multi-domain settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5bf9\u5404\u7c7b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u5982\u9519\u8bef\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6240\u6355\u83b7\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5185\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u5177\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b66\u9898 vs \u5386\u53f2\u9898\uff09\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0bAUROC\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe+34\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u975e\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u5f81\u2018\u5e7b\u89c9\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b3c\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5206\u522b\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u5e7b\u89c9\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

In addition, the holistic understanding of technical documents depends on the accurate analysis of its particular modalities, such as graphics, tables, diagrams, text, etc. and their associations. In this paper, we introduce the Kyrtos methodology for the automatic recognition and analysis of charts with curves in graphics images of technical documents. The recognition processing part adopts a clustering based approach to recognize middle-points that delimit the line-segments that construct the illustrated curves. The analysis processing part parses the extracted line-segments of curves to capture behavioral features such as direction, trend and etc. These associations assist the conversion of recognized segments' relations into attributed graphs, for the preservation of the curves' structural characteristics. The graph relations are also are expressed into natural language (NL) text sentences, enriching the document's text and facilitating their conversion into Stochastic Petri-net (SPN) graphs, which depict the internal functionality represented in the chart image. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the accuracy of Kyrtos' recognition and analysis methods by measuring the structural similarity between input chart curves and the approximations generated by Kyrtos for charts with multiple functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faKyrtos\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u6587\u6863\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u542b\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u56fe\u8868\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u7ebf\u6bb5\u4e2d\u70b9\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u66f2\u7ebf\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u652f\u6301\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u968f\u673aPetri\u7f51\uff08SPN\uff09\u4ee5\u8868\u5f81\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6280\u672f\u6587\u6863\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\u4e14\u8574\u542b\u5b9d\u8d35\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u7406\u89e3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u56fe\u5f62\u3001\u8868\u683c\u3001\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9700\u5904\u7406\u542b\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u3002", "method": "Kyrtos\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u66f2\u7ebf\u6784\u6210\u7ebf\u6bb5\u7684\u4e2d\u70b9\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5219\u4ece\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7ebf\u6bb5\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u8d8b\u52bf\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u8f6c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u968f\u673aPetri\u7f51\uff08SPN\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eKyrtos\u5728\u591a\u51fd\u6570\u56fe\u8868\u4e0a\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u539f\u59cb\u66f2\u7ebf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Kyrtos\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u66f2\u7ebf\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u6587\u6863\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, the widespread reliance on the response-level Bradley-Terry (BT) model may limit its full potential, as the reference and learnable models are assumed to be autoregressive only after deriving the objective function. Motivated by this limitation, we revisit the theoretical foundations of DPO and propose a novel formulation that explicitly introduces the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the BT model. By reformulating and extending DPO, we derive a novel variant, termed Autoregressive DPO (ADPO), that explicitly integrates autoregressive modeling into the preference optimization framework. Without violating the theoretical foundations, the derived loss takes an elegant form: it shifts the summation operation in the DPO objective outside the log-sigmoid function. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis of ADPO, we show that there exist two length measures to be considered when designing DPO-based algorithms: the token length $\u03bc$ and the feedback length $\u03bc$'.

This task targets the detection of toxic substance use and contextual attributes in Spanish clinical texts, a domain-specific, low-resource setting.

Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

Applied to a flagellated magnetic swimmer, the proposed method reproduces a variety of target trajectories, including biologically inspired paths observed in experimental studies. We further evaluate the approach on a three-sphere swimmer model, demonstrating that it can adapt to and partially compensate for wall-induced hydrodynamic effects. The proposed optimization strategy can be applied consistently across models of different fidelity, from low-dimensional ODE-based models to high-fidelity PDE-based simulations, showing its robustness and generality.

Furthermore, simply introducing DA into FL framework shows limited potential (e.g., $\\sim 0.3\\%$ increase in performance) for skin cancer classification. In addition, the DA method can improve the interpretability of the models using the gradcam++ technique, which offers clinical values. Calibration analysis also demonstrates that using DA provides a lower expected calibration error (ECE) value $\\sim 2\\%$ compared to CNN alone on a multi-modality dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e8610\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u5e38\u89c1\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08DA\uff09\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDA\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08DA\uff09\u5df2\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u4ecd\u4e3a\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u6e90\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u65e0/\u5c11\u6807\u7b7e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30DA\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u752810\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u5e38\u89c1DA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u542b\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u3001Grad-CAM++\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\uff08ECE\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "DA\u7ed3\u5408ResNet34\u5728\u8111\u80bf\u7624\uff08BT\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd4.7%\uff0c\u6297\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5e26\u6765\u7ea63%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u764c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u7ea60.3%\uff1bDA\u589e\u5f3aGrad-CAM++\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ef7\u503c\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e0aDA\u4f7f\u9884\u671f\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff08ECE\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea62%\u3002", "conclusion": "DA\u5728\u591a\u6570\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6f5c\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9002\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters. Whereas the pulse compression processes one pulse length at a time, the neural network put forward is a generative architecture going through the entire received signal in one go to generate a complete detection profile.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u590d\u6570\u503c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u8ddd\u79bb\u5256\u9762\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u56de\u6ce2\u7578\u53d8\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u8109\u51b2\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f7\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e38\u53d7\u6742\u6ce2\u3001\u6ce2\u5f62\u5931\u771f\u53ca\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u4e92\u5e72\u6270\uff08\u5982\u5408\u5e76\u611f\u77e5\u6216\u9608\u503c\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u8ddd\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u96f7\u8fbe\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u9650\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u90e8\u5206\u590d\u6570\u503c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u8ddd\u79bb\u5256\u9762\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5904\u7406\u6574\u6bb5\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u8f93\u51fa\u5b8c\u6574\u68c0\u6d4b\u5256\u9762\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u95f4\u8ddd\u4e0e\u7578\u53d8\u56de\u6ce2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u90e8\u5206\u590d\u6570\u503c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u53ca\u56de\u6ce2\u7578\u53d8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u8109\u51b2\u957f\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u90e8\u5206\u590d\u6570\u503c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u96f7\u8fbe\u56de\u6ce2\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral).

In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over continuous agreement baselines on image classification, retrieval, and dense visual prediction tasks, as well as under domain shift through self-supervised adaptation. Beyond backbone representations, we analyze the learned binary codes and show that they form a compact and informative discrete language, capturing semantic factors reusable across classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u901a\u4fe1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4fe1\u9053\u4f20\u9012\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e8c\u503c\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0e\u6295\u5f71\u5934\u5468\u671f\u91cd\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SSL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SSL\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u901a\u4fe1\uff1a\u6559\u5e08\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e8c\u503c\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u9884\u6d4b\u8be5\u6d88\u606f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u9053\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff1b\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6295\u5f71\u5934\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u5f81\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u8fde\u7eed\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u6240\u5b66\u4e8c\u503c\u7801\u6784\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u8de8\u7c7b\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u6563\u901a\u4fe1\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3aSSL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u3002"}}

Diffusion-based policies, while expressive, do not permit conservative likelihood-based updates during fine-tuning because action probabilities are intractable. In contrast, conventional Gaussian policies collapse under multimodality, particularly when actions are executed in chunks, and standard per-step critics fail to align with chunked execution, leading to poor credit assignment. We present SOFT-FLOW, a sample-efficient off-policy fine-tuning framework with normalizing flow (NF) to address these challenges. The normalizing flow policy yields exact likelihoods for multimodal action chunks, allowing conservative, stable policy updates through likelihood regularization and thereby improving sample efficiency. An action-chunked critic evaluates entire action sequences, aligning value estimation with the policy's temporal structure and improving long-horizon credit assignment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a likelihood-based, multimodal generative policy combined with chunk-level value learning on real robotic hardware. We evaluate SOFT-FLOW on two challenging dexterous manipulation tasks in the real world: cutting tape with scissors retrieved from a case, and in-hand cube rotation with a palm-down grasp -- both of which require precise, dexterous control over long horizons.

First, we show that, for general smooth and monotone variational inequalities, the classical Local Extra SGD algorithm admits tighter guarantees under a refined analysis. Next, we identify an inherent limitation of Local Extra SGD, which can lead to excessive client drift. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new algorithm, the Local Inexact Proximal Point Algorithm with Extra Step (LIPPAX), and show that it mitigates client drift and achieves improved guarantees in several regimes, including bounded Hessian, bounded operator, and low-variance settings.

The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation.

The usual specification of constraints in most CASP solvers is closer to the numerical back-end expressiveness and semantics, rather than to standard specification in ASP. In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes. In this paper, we present the FLINGO language (and tool) that incorporates the aforementioned expressiveness inside the numerical constraints and we illustrate its use with several examples. Based on previous work that established its semantic foundations, we also present a translation from the newly introduced FLINGO syntax to regular CASP programs following the CLINGCON input format.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFLINGO\u8bed\u8a00\u53ca\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u7ea6\u675f\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08CASP\uff09\u4e2d\u6570\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u652f\u6301ASP\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5c5e\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5982\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u3001\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u805a\u5408\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5230CLINGCON\u683c\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CASP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u6570\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u504f\u5411\u540e\u7aef\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4e22\u5931\u4e86ASP\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u8c13\u8bcd\u8868\u793a\u6570\u503c\u5c5e\u6027\u6240\u5177\u6709\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff08\u5982\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u3001\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u805a\u5408\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0FLINGO\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5c06ASP\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5c5e\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u5d4c\u5165\u6570\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e2d\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4eceFLINGO\u8bed\u6cd5\u5230\u6807\u51c6CASP\uff08CLINGCON\u683c\u5f0f\uff09\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684FLINGO\u8bed\u8a00\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709CASP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "FLINGO\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86ASP\u4e0eCASP\u5728\u6570\u503c\u5efa\u6a21\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CASP\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts. The resulting planner integrates into standard MDLM sampling to select where-to-unmask, improving reasoning accuracy without modifying the token prediction model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGt-Margin\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6b63\u786etoken\u4e0e\u6700\u5f3a\u7ade\u4e89token\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5dee\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\uff1b\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u76d1\u7763\u5f0funmasking planner\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MDLM\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MDLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684unmasking\u987a\u5e8f\uff08where-to-unmask\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6216\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGt-Margin\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9etoken\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8fb9\u9645\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u9020oracle unmasking\u987a\u5e8f\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u901a\u8fc7learning-to-rank\u8bad\u7ec3\u76d1\u7763\u5f0funmasking planner\uff0c\u4ecemasked\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u8be5\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0planner\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u539ftoken\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MDLM\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Gt-Margin\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u2018\u5148\u6613\u540e\u96be\u2019\u7684unmasking\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u76d1\u7763\u5f0fplanner\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

The retrieval-ranking dataset contains 1,091 manually verified query-positive-negative document triplets drawn from diverse Amharic sources and constructed to support contrastive training and benchmarking of neural retrievers (e.g., DPR, ColBERT-style late interaction and SPLADE-style sparse neural retrieval). Triplets are created through a combination of expert-curated queries, web-derived queries, and LLM-assisted generation, with positive/negative documents selected from the web or synthesized by LLMs and then validated by native speakers.

In this work, we study how to adapt pretrained visuomotor diffusion policies to reflect preferred behaviors using limited demonstrations. We introduce RKO, a novel preference-alignment method that combines the benefits of two recent frameworks: RPO and KTO. We evaluate RKO against common preference learning frameworks, including these two, as well as a baseline vanilla diffusion policy, on real-world cloth-folding tasks spanning multiple garments and preference settings. We show that preference-aligned policies (particularly RKO) achieve superior performance and sample efficiency compared to standard diffusion policy fine-tuning.

Although methods like low-rank adapters help address these challenges by adding small trainable modules to the frozen LM, they also increase memory usage and do not reduce inference latency. We uncover an intriguing phenomenon: sparsifying specific model rows and columns enables efficient task adaptation without requiring weight tuning. We propose a scheme for effective finetuning via sparsification using training stochastic gates, which requires minimal trainable parameters, reduces inference time, and removes 20--40\\% of model parameters without significant accuracy loss. Empirical results show it outperforms recent finetuning baselines in efficiency and performance. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of this stochastic gating process, and show that our method admits a simpler and better-conditioned optimization landscape compared to LoRA.

Image-to-3D foundations models can solve this issue by reconstructing 3D data from 2D modalites. Current foundation models are trained on natural image distributions to reconstruct naturalistic objects from a single image by leveraging geometric priors across pixels. However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG. These are evaluated across six medical datasets spanning anatomical and pathological structures and two natrual datasets, using voxel based metrics and point cloud distance metrics. Across medical datasets, voxel based overlap remains moderate for all models, consistent with a depth reconstruction failure mode when inferring volume from a single slice. In contrast, global distance metrics show more separation between methods: SAM3D achieves the strongest overall topological similarity to ground truth medical 3D data, while alternative models are more prone to over-simplication of reconstruction. Our results quantify the limits of single-slice medical reconstruction and highlight depth ambiguity caused by the planar nature of 2D medical data, motivating multi-view image-to-3D reconstruction to enable reliable medical 3D inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5355\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa3D\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f53\u7d20\u91cd\u53e0\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e2d\u7b49\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u5355\u5207\u7247\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\uff1bSAM3D\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8f6c\u5411\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u5efa\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b663D\u63a8\u65ad\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u89e3\u5256\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u8bca\u7597\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u89c4\u5bb9\u79ef\u6210\u50cf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff1b\u5229\u75282D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa3D\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u671b\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d65\u4e2aSOTA\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u6a21\u578b\uff08SAM3D\u3001Hunyuan3D-2.1\u3001Direct3D\u3001Hi3DGen\u3001TripoSG\uff09\uff0c\u57286\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u89e3\u5256\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u53ca2\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f53\u7d20\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e24\u7c7b\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u91cd\u53e0\u7387\u5747\u5904\u4e8e\u4e2d\u7b49\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u5168\u5c40\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u6807\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff1aSAM3D\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u5207\u7247\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u91cd\u5efa\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e2D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u672c\u8d28\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff1b\u5e94\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u91cd\u5efa\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u4e09\u7ef4\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation.

Code is available at: https://github.com/zkkli/K-Sort-Eval", "summary": "The rapid development of visual generative models raises the need for more scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods. While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faK-Sort Eval\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u6b63\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f17\u5305\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5982Arena\u5e73\u53f0\uff09\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u7528VLM\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u5224\u65ad\u53c8\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5176\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfK-Sort Arena\u4eba\u7c7b\u6295\u7968\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165(K+1)-way\u81ea\u7531\u6bd4\u5bf9\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\uff09\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u6743\u8861\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5355\u6b21\u6bd4\u8f83\u6536\u76ca\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eK-Sort Eval\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0eK-Sort Arena\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u4e8e90\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "K-Sort Eval\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3aVLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGHS-TDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5047\u8bbe\u56fe\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u96be\u4fee\u6b63\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGHS-TDA\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5047\u8bbe\u56fe\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u6761\u5019\u9009\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u540c\u8c03\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u9aa8\u67b6\u3002", "result": "GHS-TDA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3CoT\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, developing a unified controller that robustly supports diverse human motions remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically distill multiple expert policies into a single general policy, which often inevitably leads to performance degradation, particularly on highly dynamic motions. This paper presents TeleGate, a unified whole-body teleoperation framework for humanoid robots that achieves high-precision tracking across various motions while avoiding the performance loss inherent in knowledge distillation. Our key idea is to preserve the full capability of domain-specific expert policies by training a lightweight gating network, which dynamically activates experts in real-time based on proprioceptive states and reference trajectories. Furthermore, to compensate for the absence of future reference trajectories in real-time teleoperation, we introduce a VAE-based motion prior module that extracts implicit future motion intent from historical observations, enabling anticipatory control for motions requiring prediction such as jumping and standing up. We conducted empirical evaluations in simulation and also deployed our technique on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Using only 2.5 hours of motion capture data for training, our TeleGate achieves high-precision real-time teleoperation across diverse dynamic motions (e.g., running, fall recovery, and jumping), significantly outperforming the baseline methods in both tracking accuracy and success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TeleGate\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408VAE\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u5168\u8eab\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5404\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u5b8c\u6574\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTeleGate\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b9e\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u5e94\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9700\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u8df3\u8dc3\u3001\u8d77\u7acb\uff09\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548cUnitree G1\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ec5\u75282.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u52a8\u6355\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u8dd1\u6b65\u3001\u8dcc\u5012\u6062\u590d\u3001\u8df3\u8dc3\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TeleGate\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u610f\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5168\u8eab\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLARV\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5c42\u5206\u914d\u7279\u5b9a\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u5927\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4e2d\u5404\u5c42\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u6d45\u5c42\u6613\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u6df1\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u7a33\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u5e76\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "LARV\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u3001\u4e0e\u5408\u5e76\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u514d\u8d39\u5c42\u4ee3\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u5c42\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7ea7\u6216\u8fde\u7eed\u6620\u5c04\uff09\u3002", "result": "LARV\u5728FusionBench\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u5408\u5e76\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5982Iso-C+LARV\u5728ViT-L/14\u8fbe92.6%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6291\u5236\u6d45\u5c42\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LARV\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u5408\u5e76\u5668\u3001\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4ece\u7edf\u4e00\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans. If the suggestion by the pattern is inaccurate and no valid plan can be found, the pattern is extended until it contains the causal order of actions in a valid plan, making the approach complete. In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution. Experimental results show that our SPP planner Patty $(i)$ outperforms all other planners in the literature in the majority of temporal domains without ICEs, $(ii)$ obtains comparable results with the SoTA search planner for ICS in literature domains with ICEs, and $(iii)$ outperforms the same planner in a novel domain based on a real-world application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u6a21\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\uff08SPP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e26\u6709\u4e2d\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6548\u679c\uff08ICEs\uff09\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u5668Patty\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SPP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6/\u6548\u679c\uff08ICEs\uff09\u7684\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06SPP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u652f\u6301durative\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u523b\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5/\u65bd\u52a0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u5212\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u523b\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6/\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eSMT\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668Patty\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePatty\u5728\u591a\u6570\u65e0ICEs\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff1b\u5728\u542bICEs\u7684\u6587\u732e\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u641c\u7d22\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "SPP\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5e26ICEs\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\uff0cPatty\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Current VLN research for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relies on detailed, pre-specified instructions to guide the UAV along predetermined routes. However, real-world outdoor exploration typically occurs in unknown environments where detailed navigation instructions are unavailable. Instead, only coarse-grained positional or directional guidance can be provided, requiring UAVs to autonomously navigate through continuous planning and obstacle avoidance. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoFly, an end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for autonomous UAV navigation. AutoFly incorporates a pseudo-depth encoder that derives depth-aware features from RGB inputs to enhance spatial reasoning, coupled with a progressive two-stage training strategy that effectively aligns visual, depth, and linguistic representations with action policies. Moreover, existing VLN datasets have fundamental limitations for real-world autonomous navigation, stemming from their heavy reliance on explicit instruction-following over autonomous decision-making and insufficient real-world data. To address these issues, we construct a novel autonomous navigation dataset that shifts the paradigm from instruction-following to autonomous behavior modeling through: (1) trajectory collection emphasizing continuous obstacle avoidance, autonomous planning, and recognition workflows; (2) comprehensive real-world data integration. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoFly achieves a 3.9% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA baselines, with consistent performance across simulated and real environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAutoFly\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u6237\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\uff08VLN\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8be6\u7ec6\u9884\u8bbe\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u771f\u5b9e\u6237\u5916\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ec5\u6709\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6216\u65b9\u5411\u6307\u5f15\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAutoFly\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4f2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u4eceRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fde\u7eed\u907f\u969c\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "AutoFly\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA VLA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u53473.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoFly\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6240\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4ece\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

Motivated by these insights, we study how gradient information can be leveraged to improve neural network's ability to approximate high-frequency functions, and we propose a gradient-based residual connection as a complement to the standard identity skip connection used in residual networks. We provide simple theoretical intuition for why gradient information can help distinguish inputs and improve the approximation of functions with rapidly varying behaviour. On a synthetic regression task with a high-frequency sinusoidal ground truth, we show that conventional residual connections struggle to capture high-frequency patterns. In contrast, our gradient residual substantially improves approximation quality. We then introduce a convex combination of the standard and gradient residuals, allowing the network to flexibly control how strongly it relies on gradient information. After validating the design choices of our proposed method through an ablation study, we further validate our approach's utility on the single-image super-resolution task, where the underlying function may be high-frequency. Finally, on standard tasks such as image classification and segmentation, our method achieves performance comparable to standard residual networks, suggesting its broad utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u9891\u6b63\u5f26\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u51fd\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u96be\u5ea6\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u68af\u5ea6-based\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u6052\u7b49\u8df3\u8fde\u7684\u8865\u5145\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u51f8\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u5408\u6210\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b\u5728\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u9891\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u68af\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability.

Inferring Willingness to Pay from Subjective Choices", "comment": null, "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications such as travel assistance and purchasing support, they are often required to make subjective choices on behalf of users in settings where no objectively correct answer exists. We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level.

Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \\& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment.

In large-scale ad ranking, increasing model capacity is a promising path to improving both predictive performance and business outcomes, yet production serving budgets impose strict constraints on latency and FLOPs. This creates a central tension: we want interaction modules that both scale effectively with additional compute and remain compute-efficient at serving time. In this work, we study how to scale feature interaction modules under a fixed serving budget. We find that naively scaling DCNv2 and MaskNet, despite their widespread adoption in industry, yields rapidly diminishing offline gains in the Pinterest ads ranking system. To overcome aforementioned limitations, we propose ML-DCN, an interaction module that integrates an instance-conditioned mask into a low-rank crossing layer, enabling per-example selection and amplification of salient interaction directions while maintaining efficient computation. This novel architecture combines the strengths of DCNv2 and MaskNet, scales efficiently with increased compute, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on a large internal Pinterest ads dataset show that ML-DCN achieves higher AUC than DCNv2, MaskNet, and recent scaling-oriented alternatives at matched FLOPs, and it scales more favorably overall as compute increases, exhibiting a stronger AUC-FLOPs trade-off.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising few-shot generalization, but their application to roadside LiDAR is limited by a modality gap between sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D imagery. We propose a framework that bridges this gap by adapting off-the-shelf VLMs for fine-grained truck classification without parameter fine-tuning. Our new depth-aware image generation pipeline applies noise removal, spatial and temporal registration, orientation rectification, morphological operations, and anisotropic smoothing to transform sparse, occluded LiDAR scans into depth-encoded 2D visual proxies. Validated on a real-world dataset of 20 vehicle classes, our approach achieves competitive classification accuracy with as few as 16-30 examples per class, offering a scalable alternative to data-intensive supervised baselines. We further observe a \"Semantic Anchor\" effect: text-based guidance regularizes performance in ultra-low-shot regimes $k < 4$, but degrades accuracy in more-shot settings due to semantic mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this framework as a Cold Start strategy, using VLM-generated labels to bootstrap lightweight supervised models. Notably, the few-shot VLM-based model achieves over correct classification rate of 75 percent for specific drayage categories (20ft, 40ft, and 53ft containers) entirely without the costly training or fine-tuning, significantly reducing the intensive demands of initial manual labeling, thus achieving a method of practical use in ITS applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u9002\u914d\u73b0\u6210\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u8def\u4fa7LiDAR\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5361\u8f66\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u4e91\u8f6c\u4e3a2D\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0816\u201330\u4f8b/\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u2018\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u2019\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLiDAR\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5361\u8f66\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u800cVLM\u867d\u5177\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8eLiDAR\uff08\u7a00\u758f3D\u70b9\u4e91\uff09\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u7a20\u5bc62D\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u914d\u51c6\u3001\u671d\u5411\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cbLiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u76842D\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u5165\u51bb\u7ed3\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u5546\u7528VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u2018\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u2019\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u2014\u2014\u7528VLM\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u7c7b\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u8f86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6bcf\u7c7b16\u201330\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5373\u8fbe\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u62d6\u8f66\u7c7b\u522b\uff0820ft/40ft/53ft\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0>75%\u6b63\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0k<4\u65f6\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0ck\u589e\u5927\u540e\u56e0\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u914d\u53cd\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eITS\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3aLiDAR\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86VLM\u57283D\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode.

Understanding how individual features influence model outcomes is crucial for building interpretable and equitable models. While feature importance metrics for accuracy are well-established, methods for assessing feature contributions to fairness remain underexplored. We propose two model-agnostic approaches to measure fair feature importance. First, we propose to compare model fairness before and after permuting feature values. This simple intervention-based approach decouples a feature and model predictions to measure its contribution to training.

Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points.

However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24).

We present a systematic, controlled study of VLA scaling that revisits core training choices for pretraining across diverse robots. Using a representative VLA framework that combines a vision-language backbone with flow-matching, we ablate key design decisions under matched conditions and evaluate in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments. To improve the reliability of real-world results, we introduce a Grouped Blind Ensemble protocol that blinds operators to model identity and separates policy execution from outcome judgment, reducing experimenter bias. Our analysis targets three dimensions of VLA scaling. (1) Physical alignment: we show that a unified end-effector (EEF)-relative action representation is critical for robust cross-embodiment transfer. (2) Embodiment mixture: we find that naively pooling heterogeneous robot datasets often induces negative transfer rather than gains, underscoring the fragility of indiscriminate data scaling. (3) Training regularization: we observe that intuitive strategies, such as sensory dropout and multi-stage fine-tuning, do not consistently improve performance at scale. Together, this study challenge some common assumptions about embodied scaling and provide practical guidance for training large-scale VLA policies from diverse robotic data.

Recent diffusion-based policies further improve RL by modeling complex, high-dimensional action distributions. However, existing diffusion policies primarily rely on statistical associations and fail to explicitly account for causal relationships among states, actions, and rewards, limiting their ability to identify which action components truly cause high returns. In this paper, we propose Causality-guided Diffusion Policy (CausalGDP), a unified framework that integrates causal reasoning into diffusion-based RL. CausalGDP first learns a base diffusion policy and an initial causal dynamical model from offline data, capturing causal dependencies among states, actions, and rewards. During real-time interaction, the causal information is continuously updated and incorporated as a guidance signal to steer the diffusion process toward actions that causally influence future states and rewards. By explicitly considering causality beyond association, CausalGDP focuses policy optimization on action components that genuinely drive performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that CausalGDP consistently achieves competitive or superior performance over state-of-the-art diffusion-based and offline RL methods, especially in complex, high-dimensional control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCausality-guided Diffusion Policy\uff08CausalGDP\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u878d\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u52a8\u4f5c\u6210\u5206\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u6b63\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6210\u5206\u3002", "method": "CausalGDP\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u8c03\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u4f5c\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCausalGDP\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u578b\u53ca\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed.

We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u5177\u5907\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "DRL\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u533b\u751f\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u7406\u7531\u3001\u6307\u5357\u6216\u66f4\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM-as-a-judge\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08GED\uff09\u5dee\u5f02\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4fee\u6b63\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u5b58\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff08DR-KB\uff09\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7RAG\u68c0\u7d22\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u6307\u4ee4\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u8fd4\u9662\u9884\u6d4b\uff08RVA\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDRL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u53c2\u8003\u63a8\u7406\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0etop-k\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u5747\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DRL\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650token\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

We propose NavDreamer, a video-based framework for 3D navigation that leverages generative video models as a universal interface between language instructions and navigation trajectories. Our main hypothesis is that video's ability to encode spatiotemporal information and physical dynamics, combined with internet-scale availability, enables strong zero-shot generalization in navigation. To mitigate the stochasticity of generative predictions, we introduce a sampling-based optimization method that utilizes a VLM for trajectory scoring and selection. An inverse dynamics model is employed to decode executable waypoints from generated video plans for navigation. To systematically evaluate this paradigm in several video model backbones, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering object navigation, precise navigation, spatial grounding, language control, and scene reasoning.

While transformer-based and large-parameter models have recently achieved state-of-the-art results, their complexity can lead to overfitting and unstable forecasts, especially when older data points become less relevant. In this paper, we propose a lightweight multi-view approach to short-term load forecasting that leverages single-value embeddings and a scaled time-range input to capture temporally relevant features efficiently. We introduce an embedding dropout mechanism to prevent over-reliance on specific features and enhance interpretability. Our method achieves competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters, demonstrating robustness across multiple datasets, including scenarios with noisy or sparse data, and provides insights into the contributions of individual features to the forecast.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u77ed\u671f\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u8f93\u5165\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u4e22\u5f03\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\uff1b\u9700\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u503c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u7f29\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u8f93\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5d4c\u5165\u4e22\u5f03\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u8868\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u77ed\u65f6\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This scoping review maps the existing deep learning-based approaches for detecting, classifying, and designing a comprehensive application framework for visual pollution management. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, seven academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, ScienceDirect, SpringerNatureLink, and Wiley) were systematically searched and reviewed, and 26 articles were found. Most research focuses on specific pollutant categories and employs variations of YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet architectures. Although several datasets exist, they are limited to specific areas and lack standardized taxonomies. Few studies integrate detection into real-time application systems, yet they tend to be geographically skewed. We proposed a framework for monitoring visual pollution that integrates a visual pollution index to assess the severity of visual pollution for a certain area.

Experiments on four reasoning datasets show that ESTAR reduces reasoning length by about 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) while preserving accuracy (74.9% vs. 74.2%), with strong cross-domain generalization.

In contrast, unsupervised skill discovery can potentially reduce these burdens by learning a diverse repertoire of useful skills driven by intrinsic motivation. However, existing methods exhibit two key limitations: they typically rely on a single policy to master a versatile repertoire of behaviors without modeling the shared structure or distinctions among them, which results in low learning efficiency; moreover, they are susceptible to reward hacking, where the reward signal increases and converges rapidly while the learned skills display insufficient actual diversity. In this work, we introduce an Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE) architecture that prevents diverse behaviors from collapsing into overlapping representations, enabling a single policy to master a wide spectrum of locomotion skills.

We introduce a barycentric alignment framework that quotients out these nuisance symmetries to construct a universal embedding space across many models. Unlike existing similarity measures, which summarize relationships over entire stimulus sets, this framework enables similarity to be defined at the level of individual stimuli, revealing inputs that elicit convergent versus divergent representations across models. Using this instance-level notion of similarity, we identify systematic input properties that predict representational convergence versus divergence across vision and language model families. We also construct universal embedding spaces for brain representations across individuals and cortical regions, enabling instance-level comparison of representational agreement across stages of the human visual hierarchy. Finally, we apply the same barycentric alignment framework to purely unimodal vision and language models and find that post-hoc alignment into a shared space yields image text similarity scores that closely track human cross-modal judgments and approach the performance of contrastively trained vision-language models. This strikingly suggests that independently learned representations already share sufficient geometric structure for human-aligned cross-modal comparison. Together, these results show that resolving representational similarity at the level of individual stimuli reveals phenomena that cannot be detected by set-level comparison metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5fc3\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08barycentric alignment\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d88\u9664\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5e72\u6270\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u523a\u6fc0\uff08instance-level\uff09\u5c42\u9762\u8861\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5927\u8111\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6216\u5206\u6b67\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u53ca\u8111\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u5f81\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6392\u5217\u4efb\u610f\u6027\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4ec5\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u523a\u6fc0\u96c6\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u603b\u7ed3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u523b\u753b\u4e2a\u4f53\u523a\u6fc0\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6216\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u5fc3\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08quotient space\uff09\u65b9\u5f0f\u6d88\u9664\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u5173\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u6a21\u578b/\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5/\u8de8\u8111\u533a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\uff08stimulus-level\uff09\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u6536\u655b/\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u548c\u76ae\u5c42\u533a\u57df\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8111\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b3\uff09\u5bf9\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u56fe\u6587\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u96c6\u5408\u7ea7\u5ea6\u91cf\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u5df2\u8574\u542b\u8db3\u591f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u91cd\u5fc3\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \\emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \\emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay.

This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems.

Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality. Experimental results on gender bias benchmarks demonstrate that Context-CDA effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing language modeling performance while offering insights into social biases by analyzing distribution shifts in next-token generation probabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faContext-CDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08CDA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u56e0\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u5883\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faContext-CDA\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u518d\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cContext-CDA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0b\u4e00\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u63ed\u793a\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684CDA\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Detecting these artifacts is essential: without detection, we cannot benchmark generators or train reward models to improve them. Current detectors fine-tune VLMs on tens of thousands of labeled images, but this is expensive to repeat whenever generators evolve or new artifact types emerge. We show that pretrained VLMs already encode the knowledge needed to detect artifacts - with the right scaffolding, this capability can be unlocked using only a few hundred labeled examples per artifact category.

When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained foundation models, they typically focus on either linguistic planning or visual forecasting in isolation. These methods rarely integrate both capabilities simultaneously to guide action generation, leading to suboptimal performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose BagelVLA, a unified model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation within a single framework. Initialized from a pretrained unified understanding and generative model, BagelVLA is trained to interleave textual reasoning and visual prediction directly into the action execution loop. To efficiently couple these modalities, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG), which initializes from current observation and leverages single-step denoising to extract predictive visual features, guiding action generation with minimal latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BagelVLA outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin on multiple simulated and real-world benchmarks, particularly in tasks requiring multi-stage reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBagelVLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08RFG\uff09\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9ad8\u6548\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u957f\u5468\u671f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Vision-Language-Action\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u5212\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u957f\u5468\u671f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBagelVLA\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea4\u7ec7\u5d4c\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u5faa\u73af\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08RFG\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5355\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBagelVLA\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "BagelVLA\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u5bf9\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/tryzang/FD-DB", "summary": "Synthetic data provide low-cost, accurately annotated samples for geometry-sensitive vision tasks, but appearance and imaging differences between synthetic and real domains cause severe domain shift and degrade downstream performance. Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFD-DB\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u5206\u652f\u63a7\u5236\u767d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u66dd\u5149\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u9ad8\u9891\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u652f\u8865\u5145\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u867d\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u6210\u50cf\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5149\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9891\u7387\u89e3\u8026\u53cc\u5206\u652f\uff08FD-DB\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4f4e\u9891\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u7406\u7f16\u8f91\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u767d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u66dd\u5149\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u70b9\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u5916\u89c2\u57fa\u5e95\uff1b\u9ad8\u9891\u81ea\u7531\u5206\u652f\u751f\u6210\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u9891\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u878d\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\uff1b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5148\u7a33\u7f16\u8f91\u652f\uff0c\u518d\u542f\u6b8b\u5dee\u652f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728YCB-V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cFD-DB\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u771f\u5b9e\u57df\u5916\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FD-DB\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5408\u6210-\u771f\u5b9e\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u654f\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

In long-horizon TIR trajectories, an early irrecoverable mistake can determine success or failure, making it crucial to localize the first irrecoverable step and leverage it for fine-grained credit assignment. We propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), which localizes the first irrecoverable step via binary-search rollout trees under a fixed rollout budget, converts the resulting tree into stable learning signals through hierarchical advantage attribution, and applies error-localized adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on the critical step and its suffix. Across TIR benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, ELPO consistently outperforms strong Agentic RL baselines under comparable sampling budgets, with additional gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency.

However, the whole-body teleoperation of such robots remains a problem: operators must coordinate a wheeled base and two arms while reasoning about obstacles and contact. Existing interfaces are predominantly hand-centric (e.g., VR controllers and joysticks), leaving foot-operated channels underexplored for continuous base control. We present TriPilot-FF, an open-source whole-body teleoperation system for a custom bimanual mobile manipulator that introduces a foot-operated pedal with lidar-driven pedal haptics, coupled with upper-body bimanual leader-follower teleoperation. Using only a low-cost base-mounted lidar, TriPilot-FF renders a resistive pedal cue from proximity-to-obstacle signals in the commanded direction, shaping operator commands toward collision-averse behaviour without an explicit collision-avoidance controller. The system also supports arm-side force reflection for contact awareness and provides real-time force and visual guidance of bimanual manipulability to prompt mobile base repositioning, thereby improving reach. We demonstrate the capability of TriPilot-FF to effectively ``co-pilot'' the human operator over long time-horizons and tasks requiring precise mobile base movement and coordination. Finally, we incorporate teleoperation feedback signals into an Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) policy and demonstrate improved performance when the additional information is available. We release the pedal device design, full software stack, and conduct extensive real-world evaluations on a bimanual wheeled platform.

We introduce RAPID (Risk of Attribute Prediction--Induced Disclosure), a disclosure risk measure that directly quantifies inferential vulnerability under a realistic attack model. An adversary trains a predictive model solely on the released synthetic data and applies it to real individuals' quasi-identifiers. For continuous sensitive attributes, RAPID reports the proportion of records whose predicted values fall within a specified relative error tolerance. For categorical attributes, we propose a baseline-normalized confidence score that measures how much more confident the attacker is about the true class than would be expected from class prevalence alone, and we summarize risk as the fraction of records exceeding a policy-defined threshold. This construction yields an interpretable, bounded risk metric that is robust to class imbalance, independent of any specific synthesizer, and applicable with arbitrary learning algorithms. We illustrate threshold calibration, uncertainty quantification, and comparative evaluation of synthetic data generators using simulations and real data.

However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected.\n  In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets.

However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TaCo, the first comprehensive benchmark for Tactile data Codecs. TaCo evaluates 30 compression methods, including off-the-shelf compression algorithms and neural codecs, across five diverse datasets from various sensor types. We systematically assess both lossless and lossy compression schemes on four key tasks: lossless storage, human visualization, material and object classification, and dexterous robotic grasping. Notably, we pioneer the development of data-driven codecs explicitly trained on tactile data, TaCo-LL (lossless) and TaCo-L (lossy).

This promise relies on the field's assumption that input features marked as important by an XAI must contain information about the target variable. However, it is unclear whether informativeness is indeed the main driver of importance attribution in practice, or if other data properties such as statistical suppression, novelty at test-time, or high feature salience substantially contribute. To clarify this, we trained deep learning models on three variants of a binary image classification task, in which translucent watermarks are either absent, act as class-dependent confounds, or represent class-independent noise. Results for five popular attribution methods show substantially elevated relative importance in watermarked areas (RIW) for all models regardless of the training setting ($R^2 \\geq .45$). By contrast, whether the presence of watermarks is class-dependent or not only has a marginal effect on RIW ($R^2 \\leq .03$), despite a clear impact impact on model performance and generalisation ability. XAI methods show similar behaviour to model-agnostic edge detection filters and attribute substantially less importance to watermarks when bright image intensities are encoded by smaller instead of larger feature values. These results indicate that importance attribution is most strongly driven by the salience of image structures at test time rather than statistical associations learned by machine learning models.

Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAlign-TI\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411Token Interactions\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9-\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08IVA\uff09\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5185token\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08TPA\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001next-token\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8574\u542b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u52a8\u6001token\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAlign-TI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bIVA\uff08\u5bf9\u9f50\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u6a21\u4eff\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u53d6\u6307\u4ee4\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u548cTPA\uff08\u5bf9\u9f50token-to-token\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u903b\u8f91\uff09\u3002", "result": "Align-TI\u76f8\u8f83Vanilla KD\u63d0\u53472.6%\uff1b\u84b8\u998f\u6240\u5f97Align-TI-2B\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8aLLaVA-1.5-7B\u8fbe7.0%\uff0c\u521bSOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "Align-TI\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u5173\u952etoken\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MLLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Its goal was to assess how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks: generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes (FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies. Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedSurg\u6311\u6218\u9996\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u5916\u79d1\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u5fae\u8c03\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u5904\u7406\u662f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a81\u7834\u53e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5916\u79d1\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u672c\u5730\u5fae\u8c03\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3Appendix300\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53c2\u8d5b\u961f\u4f0d\u91c7\u7528ViViT\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u3001\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u591a\u79cdFL\u805a\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982FedAvg\u3001FedMedian\u3001FedSAM\uff09\u5b8c\u6210\u708e\u75c7\u5206\u671f\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6db5\u76d6\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9002\u914d\u4e24\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ecF1-score\u548cExpected Cost\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Bootstrap\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6392\u540d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8de8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u9002\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u961f\u4f0d\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u5747\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u6392\u540d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f4e\uff1bViViT\u65b9\u6848\u6574\u4f53\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u3001\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u654f\u611f\u3001\u8d85\u53c2\u8c03\u4f18\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "FedSurg\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5916\u79d1\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5916\u79d1AI\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

We address this gap with a lightweight, fully on-device pipeline that converts natural-language commands into reliable manipulation. Our approach has two stages: (i) the instruction to actions module (Instruct2Act), a compact BiLSTM with a multi-head-attention autoencoder that parses an instruction into an ordered sequence of atomic actions (e.g., reach, grasp, move, place); and (ii) the robot action network (RAN), which uses the dynamic adaptive trajectory radial network (DATRN) together with a vision-based environment analyzer (YOLOv8) to generate precise control trajectories for each sub-action. The entire system runs on a modest system with no cloud services. On our custom proprietary dataset, Instruct2Act attains 91.5% sub-actions prediction accuracy while retaining a small footprint. Real-robot evaluations across four tasks (pick-place, pick-pour, wipe, and pick-give) yield an overall 90% success; sub-action inference completes in < 3.8s, with end-to-end executions in 30-60s depending on task complexity. These results demonstrate that fine-grained instruction-to-action parsing, coupled with DATRN-based trajectory generation and vision-guided grounding, provides a practical path to deterministic, real-time manipulation in resource-constrained, single-camera settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5168\u7aef\u4fa7\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684 pipeline\uff0c\u5305\u542b Instruct2Act\uff08\u6307\u4ee4\u89e3\u6790\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u548c RAN\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e DATRN \u4e0e YOLOv8 \u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u3001\u5355\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7aef\u4fa7 pipeline\uff1a1) Instruct2Act\u2014\u2014\u8f7b\u91cf BiLSTM + \u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u89e3\u6790\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b2) RAN\u2014\u2014\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f84\u5411\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DATRN\uff09\u4e0e YOLOv8 \u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u5206\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5404\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "Instruct2Act \u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe 91.5%\uff1b\u771f\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u56db\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6574\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u7387 90%\uff1b\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406 <3.8s\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u8017\u65f6 30\u201360s\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u4ee4\u89e3\u6790\u3001DATRN \u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u5355\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We show that static inference induces a fundamental tradeoff: improving stability requires reducing reliance on shift-sensitive features, leaving an irreducible worst-case generalization floor. Instance-conditional routing can break this ceiling, but is fragile because shifts can mislead routing and perturbations can make routing fluctuate. We capture these effects via two decompositions separating coverage vs selection, and base sensitivity vs fluctuation amplification. Based on these insights, we propose STEM-GNN, a pretrain-then-finetune framework with a mixture-of-experts encoder for diverse computation paths, a vector-quantized token interface to stabilize encoder-to-head signals, and a Lipschitz-regularized head to bound output amplification.

Training-free methods, exemplified by Gaussian Shading, embed watermarks into the initial noise of diffusion models with negligible impact on the quality of generated images. However, extracting this type of watermark typically requires multi-step diffusion inversion to obtain precise initial noise, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose One-step Inversion (OSI), a significantly faster and more accurate method for extracting Gaussian Shading style watermarks. OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a learnable sign classification problem, which eliminates the need for precise regression of the initial noise. Then, we initialize the OSI model from the diffusion backbone and finetune it on synthesized noise-image pairs with a sign classification objective. In this manner, the OSI model is able to accomplish the watermark extraction efficiently in only one step. Our OSI substantially outperforms the multi-step diffusion inversion method: it is 20x faster, achieves higher extraction accuracy, and doubles the watermark payload capacity. Extensive experiments across diverse schedulers, diffusion backbones, and cryptographic schemes consistently show improvements, demonstrating the generality of our OSI framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOne-step Inversion\uff08OSI\uff09\u7684\u5355\u6b65 watermark \u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63d0\u53d6 Gaussian Shading \u7c7b\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u53cd\u6f14\u63d0\u901f20\u500d\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u8f7d\u8377\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ffb\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Gaussian Shading\uff09\u867d\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u53d6\u9700\u591a\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u53cd\u6f14\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u53d6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u56de\u5f52\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5e72\u521d\u59cb\u5316OSI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7684\u566a\u58f0-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4ee5\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "OSI\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b65\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534720\u500d\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u6c34\u5370\u8f7d\u8377\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ffb\u500d\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3001\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u5bc6\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "OSI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6b65\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce MATA, a multi-agent TableQA framework that leverages multiple complementary reasoning paths and a set of tools built with small language models. MATA generates candidate answers through diverse reasoning styles for a given table and question, then refines or selects the optimal answer with the help of these tools. Furthermore, it incorporates an algorithm designed to minimize expensive LLM agent calls, enhancing overall efficiency. MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types.

Meanwhile, recent attempts to inject reasoning into VLM-based agents improve success rates but incur substantial computational overhead. To address both the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing approaches, we introduce Hydra-Nav, a unified VLM architecture that adaptively switches between a deliberative slow system for analyzing exploration history and formulating high-level plans, and a reactive fast system for efficient execution. We train Hydra-Nav through a three-stage curriculum: (i) spatial-action alignment to strengthen trajectory planning, (ii) memory-reasoning integration to enhance temporal-spatial reasoning over long-horizon exploration, and (iii) iterative rejection fine-tuning to enable selective reasoning at critical decision points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hydra-Nav achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HM3D, MP3D, and OVON benchmarks, outperforming the second-best methods by 11.1%, 17.4%, and 21.2%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce SOT (Success weighted by Operation Time), a new metric to measure search efficiency across VLMs with varying reasoning intensity.

Prior research (Haufe et al., 2014; Wilming et al., 2022, 2023) has demonstrated that these methods often erroneously assign significant importance to non-informative variables, such as suppressor variables, leading to fundamental misinterpretations. Since statistical suppression is induced by feature dependencies, this study investigates whether data whitening, a common preprocessing technique for decorrelation, can mitigate such errors. Using the established XAI-TRIS benchmark (Clark et al., 2024b), which offers synthetic ground-truth data and quantitative measures of explanation correctness, we empirically evaluate 16 popular feature attribution methods applied in combination with 5 distinct whitening transforms. Additionally, we analyze a minimal linear two-dimensional classification problem (Wilming et al., 2023) to theoretically assess whether whitening can remove the impact of suppressor features from Bayes-optimal models. Our results indicate that, while specific whitening techniques can improve explanation performance, the degree of improvement varies substantially across XAI methods and model architectures.

Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset.

In machine translation, studies typically report only the translation quality of the student and omit the computational complexity of performing KD, making it difficult to select among the many available KD choices under compute-induced constraints. In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation. Our protocol provides reproducible guidance for selecting KD methods under explicit quality and compute-induced constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08KD\uff09\u5728\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff08\u4ee5\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u8861\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u84b8\u998f\u5f00\u9500\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff1bKD\u4ec5\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u9608\u503c\u540e\u624d\u5177\u73af\u4fdd\u6548\u76ca\uff1b\u8bcd\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u62a5\u544a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u7b97\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18KD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08MLCA\uff09\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u91cf\u5316\u4e3a\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6559\u5e08\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6392\u653e\u53ca\u786c\u4ef6\u5236\u9020\u7684\u5206\u644a\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027KD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\uff08i\uff09\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u84b8\u998f\u5f00\u9500\u4e3b\u5bfc\u603b\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0cKD\u4ec5\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4f7f\u7528\u9608\u503c\u540e\u624d\u4f53\u73b0\u51c0\u51cf\u6392\u6548\u76ca\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u8bcd\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u76f8\u6bd4\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u901a\u5e38\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u660e\u786e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u9009\u62e9\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, existing manipulation datasets remain costly to curate, highly embodiment-specific, and insufficient in coverage and diversity, thereby hindering the generalization of VLA models. Recent approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations via a plan-then-execute paradigm, where high-level plans (e.g., subtasks, trace) are first generated and subsequently translated into low-level actions, but they critically rely on extra intermediate supervision, which is largely absent from existing datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RoboInter Manipulation Suite, a unified resource including data, benchmarks, and models of intermediate representations for manipulation. It comprises RoboInter-Tool, a lightweight GUI that enables semi-automatic annotation of diverse representations, and RoboInter-Data, a large-scale dataset containing over 230k episodes across 571 diverse scenes, which provides dense per-frame annotations over more than 10 categories of intermediate representations, substantially exceeding prior work in scale and annotation quality. Building upon this foundation, RoboInter-VQA introduces 9 spatial and 20 temporal embodied VQA categories to systematically benchmark and enhance the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Meanwhile, RoboInter-VLA offers an integrated plan-then-execute framework, supporting modular and end-to-end VLA variants that bridge high-level planning with low-level execution via intermediate supervision.

Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaDS is a depth super-resolution framework using diffusion models and Gaussian smoothing properties to robustly recover high-resolution depth maps from degraded low-resolution inputs, with adaptive noise injection and strong zero-shot generalization.", "motivation": "Conventional depth super-resolution methods suffer from artifacts under severe or unknown degradation; AdaDS addresses this by leveraging the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing to ensure robust recovery.", "method": "AdaDS uses a pre-trained diffusion model and adapts the reverse diffusion process by estimating refinement uncertainty to select an optimal starting timestep and inject tailored noise, positioning intermediate samples in high-probability regions of the target posterior.", "result": "AdaDS achieves superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns on both real-world and synthetic benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "conclusion": "AdaDS provides a robust, generalizable solution for depth super-resolution by integrating diffusion priors with adaptive uncertainty-aware denoising, outperforming existing methods under arbitrary degradation."}}

While numerous studies have focused on UAV detection or localization, little attention has been given to delivery events identification. This study presents the first acoustic package delivery detection algorithm using a ground-based microphone array. The proposed method estimates both the drone's propeller speed and the delivery event using solely acoustic features. A deep neural network detects the presence of a drone and estimates the propeller's rotation speed or blade passing frequency (BPF) from a mel spectrogram. The algorithm analyzes the BPFs to identify probable delivery moments based on sudden changes before and after a specific time. Results demonstrate a mean absolute error of the blade passing frequency estimator of 16 Hz when the drone is less than 150 meters away from the microphone array. The drone presence detection estimator has a accuracy of 97%. The delivery detection algorithm correctly identifies 96% of events with a false positive rate of 8%.

The resulting transformer-based detectors outperform state-of-the-art detectors on the DEEPAL, DCLDE-2026, and two newly introduced expert-annotated datasets in terms of accuracy, energy efficiency, and speed. The detection model has a specificity of 0-28.8% at 95% sensitivity. Our multiclass species classifier obtains a top-1 accuracy of 42.1% (11 train classes, 4 test classes) and our ecotype classifier obtains a top-1 accuracy of 43.0% (4 train classes, 5 test classes) on the DCLDE-2026 dataset.\n  We yield 919 hours of SRKW data, 230 hours of Bigg's orca data, 1374 hours of orca data from unlabelled ecotypes, 1501 hours of humpback data, 88 hours of sea lion data, 246 hours of pacific white-sided dolphin data, and over 784 hours of unspecified marine mammal data.

This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e27\u5dee\u6cd5\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7AI\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eIoT\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e27\u5dee\u6cd5\uff08frame difference method\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MobileNet\u3001YOLOX\u7b49\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0eTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728AMD Alveo U50\u3001Jetson Orin Nano\u548cHailo-8T\u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534728.314%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u53473.6\u500d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e39.305%\uff1bMobileNet\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff08\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\uff09\uff0cYOLOX\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u4f4e\uff1b\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u706b\u8f66\u3001\u98de\u673a\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e27\u5dee\u6cd5\u914d\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982MobileNet\uff09\u662f\u9762\u5411IoT\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture. Analysis shows that by constructing coherent narratives, it surpasses baselines in multi-hop and temporal reasoning, underscoring its essential role in deep narrative comprehension. Additionally, we provide an open discussion on memory systems, offering our perspectives and future outlook on the field.

We propose to modify attention into a Laplacian mechanism that gives the model more direct control over token variance. We conjecture that this helps transformers achieve the ideal token geometry. To investigate our conjecture, we first show that incorporating the Laplacian mechanism into transformers induces consistent improvements across benchmarks in computer vision and language. Next, we study how the Laplacian mechanism impacts the geometry of token representations using various tools: 1) principal component analysis, 2) cosine similarity metric, 3) analysis of variance, and 4) Neural Collapse metrics. Our investigation shows that the Laplacian mechanism reshapes token embeddings toward a geometry of maximal separability: tokens collapse according to their classes, and the class means exhibit Neural Collapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u5730\u63a7\u5236token\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u4fc3\u4f7ftoken\u5d4c\u5165\u671d\u5411\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6765\u63a7\u5236token\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u60f3\u7684token\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4fee\u6539\u4e3a\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408PCA\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u548cNeural Collapse\u6307\u6807\u7b49\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u6790token\u8868\u793a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u673a\u5236\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1btoken\u5d4c\u5165\u5448\u73b0\u6309\u7c7b\u522b\u574d\u7f29\u3001\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6ee1\u8db3Neural Collapse\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5851token\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets.

This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control.

Failure to modulate force can lead to task failure or irreversible damage to the objects. Humans can precisely achieve this by adapting force from tactile feedback, even within a short period of physical contact. We aim to give robots this capability. However, commercial grippers exhibit high cost or high minimum force, making them unsuitable for studying force-controlled policy learning with everyday force-sensitive objects. We introduce TF-Gripper, a low-cost (~$150) force-controlled parallel-jaw gripper that integrates tactile sensing as feedback. It has an effective force range of 0.45-45N and is compatible with different robot arms. Additionally, we designed a teleoperation device paired with TF-Gripper to record human-applied grasping forces. While standard low-frequency policies can be trained on this data, they struggle with the reactive, contact-dependent nature of force regulation. To overcome this, we propose RETAF (REactive Tactile Adaptation of Force), a framework that decouples grasping force control from arm pose prediction. RETAF regulates force at high frequency using wrist images and tactile feedback, while a base policy predicts end-effector pose and gripper open/close action. We evaluate TF-Gripper and RETAF across five real-world tasks requiring precise force regulation. Results show that compared to position control, direct force control significantly improves grasp stability and task performance. We further show that tactile feedback is essential for force regulation, and that RETAF consistently outperforms baselines and can be integrated with various base policies. We hope this work opens a path for scaling the learning of force-controlled policies in robotic manipulation.

To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention.

This paradigm does not extend to problems where repeated evaluation is impossible and ground truth is established by the consensus synthesis of theory and existing evidence. We evaluate a Gemini-based AI environment designed to support collaborative scientific assessment, integrated into a standard scientific workflow. In collaboration with a diverse group of 13 scientists working in the field of climate science, we tested the system on a complex topic: the stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our results show that AI can accelerate the scientific workflow. The group produced a comprehensive synthesis of 79 papers through 104 revision cycles in just over 46 person-hours.

Unlike generic activity recognition, collaborative manipulation requires sub-task labels that are directly robot-executable. We present RoboSubtaskNet, a multi-stage human-to-robot sub-task segmentation framework that couples attention-enhanced I3D features (RGB plus optical flow) with a modified MS-TCN employing a Fibonacci dilation schedule to capture better short-horizon transitions such as reach-pick-place. The network is trained with a composite objective comprising cross-entropy and temporal regularizers (truncated MSE and a transition-aware term) to reduce over-segmentation and to encourage valid sub-task progressions. To close the gap between vision benchmarks and control, we introduce RoboSubtask, a dataset of healthcare and industrial demonstrations annotated at the sub-task level and designed for deterministic mapping to manipulator primitives. Empirically, RoboSubtaskNet outperforms MS-TCN and MS-TCN++ on GTEA and our RoboSubtask benchmark (boundary-sensitive and sequence metrics), while remaining competitive on the long-horizon Breakfast benchmark. Specifically, RoboSubtaskNet attains F1 @ 50 = 79.5%, Edit = 88.6%, Acc = 78.9% on GTEA; F1 @ 50 = 30.4%, Edit = 52.0%, Acc = 53.5% on Breakfast; and F1 @ 50 = 94.2%, Edit = 95.6%, Acc = 92.2% on RoboSubtask. We further validate the full perception-to-execution pipeline on a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator, achieving reliable end-to-end behavior in physical trials (overall task success approx 91.25%).

We further propose a two-step residual objective that enforces physical consistency on refined, structurally valid generative trajectories rather than noisy single-step predictions.

Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly propelled the field of computational pathology. However, their application in cytopathology, particularly cervical cytology, remains underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology.

Existing approaches address these challenges separately, either focusing on sway damping with predefined collision-free paths or performing collision avoidance only at the global planning level. We present the first collision-free, sway-damping model predictive controller (MPC) for a forestry crane that unifies both objectives in a single control framework. Our approach integrates LiDAR-based environment mapping directly into the MPC using online Euclidean distance fields (EDF), enabling real-time environmental adaptation. The controller simultaneously enforces collision constraints while damping payload sway, allowing it to (i) replan upon quasi-static environmental changes, (ii) maintain collision-free operation under disturbances, and (iii) provide safe stopping when no bypass exists. Experimental validation on a real forestry crane demonstrates effective sway damping and successful obstacle avoidance.

West", "YangQuan Chen"], "title": "Statistical Roughness-Informed Machine Unlearning", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of a designated forget set from a trained model while preserving utility on the retained data. In modern deep networks, approximate unlearning frequently fails under large or adversarial deletions due to pronounced layer-wise heterogeneity: some layers exhibit stable, well-regularized representations while others are brittle, undertrained, or overfit, so naive update allocation can trigger catastrophic forgetting or unstable dynamics. We propose Statistical-Roughness Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (SRAGU), a mechanism-first unlearning algorithm that reallocates unlearning updates using layer-wise statistical roughness operationalized via heavy-tailed spectral diagnostics of layer weight matrices. Starting from an Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (AGU) sensitivity signal computed on the forget set, SRAGU estimates a WeightWatcher-style heavy-tailed exponent for each layer, maps it to a bounded spectral stability weight, and uses this stability signal to spectrally reweight the AGU sensitivities before applying the same minibatch update form. This concentrates unlearning motion in spectrally stable layers while damping updates in unstable or overfit layers, improving stability under hard deletions. We evaluate unlearning via behavioral alignment to a gold retrained reference model trained from scratch on the retained data, using empirical prediction-divergence and KL-to-gold proxies on a forget-focused query set; we additionally report membership inference auditing as a complementary leakage signal, treating forget-set points as should-be-forgotten members during evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSRAGU\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u5c3e\u8c31\u8bca\u65ad\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5220\u9664\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u5404\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1a\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c42\u5219\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u6b20\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b80\u5355\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5f15\u53d1\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStatistical-Roughness Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (SRAGU)\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8eForget\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97AGU\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9\u6bcf\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884cWeightWatcher\u5f0f\u91cd\u5c3e\u6307\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u5bf9AGU\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8c31\u52a0\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "SRAGU\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u5220\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u3001KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4ece\u5934\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c42\u95f4\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u9057\u5fd8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0cSRAGU\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u4fe1\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose HLGFA, a high-low resolution guided feature alignment framework that learns normality by modeling cross-resolution feature consistency between high-resolution and low-resolution representations of normal samples, instead of relying on pixel-level reconstruction. Dual-resolution inputs are processed by a shared frozen backbone to extract multi-level features, and high-resolution representations are decomposed into structure and detail priors to guide the refinement of low-resolution features through conditional modulation and gated residual correction. During inference, anomalies are naturally identified as regions where cross-resolution alignment breaks down. In addition, a noise-aware data augmentation strategy is introduced to suppress nuisance-induced responses commonly observed in industrial environments. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HLGFA, achieving 97.9% pixel-level AUROC and 97.5% image-level AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset, outperforming representative reconstruction-based and feature-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHLGFA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9ad8\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u9677\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8-\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6HLGFA\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5c06\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u8c03\u5236\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6291\u5236\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec AD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523097.9%\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7AUROC\u548c97.5%\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7AUROC\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u91cd\u5efa\u5f0f\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff0cHLGFA\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out.

Yet, as humanoid robots begin to share our workplaces, homes, and public spaces, the design challenge expands. We must now consider not only factors for humans but also factors for humanoids, since both will coexist and interact within the same environments. Unlike conventional machines, humanoids introduce expectations of human-like behavior, communication, and social presence, which reshape usability, trust, and safety considerations. In this article, we introduce the concept of humanoid factors as a framework structured around four pillars - physical, cognitive, social, and ethical - that shape the development of humanoids to help them effectively coexist and collaborate with humans. This framework characterizes the overlap and divergence between human capabilities and those of general-purpose humanoids powered by AI foundation models. To demonstrate our framework's practical utility, we then apply the framework to evaluate a real-world humanoid control algorithm, illustrating how conventional task completion metrics in robotics overlook key human cognitive and interaction principles.

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning is a key mechanism for improvement, but its effectiveness is fundamentally governed by reward design. Despite its importance, the relationship between reward modeling and core LLM challenges--such as evaluation bias, hallucination, distribution shift, and efficient learning--remains poorly understood. This work argues that reward modeling is not merely an implementation detail but a central architect of reasoning alignment, shaping what models learn, how they generalize, and whether their outputs can be trusted. We introduce Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL), a unifying framework that systematizes diverse reward paradigms for multi-step reasoning. Within this framework, we present a taxonomy of reward mechanisms, analyze reward hacking as a pervasive failure mode, and examine how reward signals unify challenges ranging from inference-time scaling to hallucination mitigation. We further critically evaluate existing benchmarks, highlighting vulnerabilities such as data contamination and reward misalignment, and outline directions for more robust evaluation. By integrating fragmented research threads and clarifying the interplay between reward design and fundamental reasoning capabilities, this work provides a foundational roadmap for building reasoning models that are robust, verifiable, and trustworthy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faReasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3001\u5206\u6790\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7b49\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6279\u5224\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u5341\u5206\u532e\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6Reasoning-Aligned Reinforcement Learning (RARL)\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u7c7b\u5956\u52b1\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5178\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u8003\u5bdf\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5982\u4f55\u7edf\u4e00\u523b\u753b\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5982\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\uff09\uff1b\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u975e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u2018\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u2019\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u9610\u91ca\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff1b\u9610\u660e\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6839\u672c\u56e0\u7d20\uff1bRARL\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5398\u6e05\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

Designed as a controlled reference set under near-optimal acoustic and linguistic conditions, the benchmark was used to evaluate 37 models, ranging from Bambara-trained systems to large-scale commercial models. Our findings reveal that current ASR performance remains significantly below deployment standards in a narrow formal domain; the top-performing system in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) achieved 46.76\\% and the best Character Error Rate (CER) of 13.00\\% was set by another model, while several prominent multilingual models exceeded 100\\% WER.

However, visuo-tactile perception is critical for contact-rich manipulation, as tasks such as insertion are difficult to complete robustly using vision alone. At the same time, acquiring large-scale and reliable tactile data in the physical world remains costly and challenging, and the lack of a unified evaluation platform further limits policy learning and systematic analysis. To address these challenges, we propose UniVTAC, a simulation-based visuo-tactile data synthesis platform that supports three commonly used visuo-tactile sensors and enables scalable and controllable generation of informative contact interactions. Based on this platform, we introduce the UniVTAC Encoder, a visuo-tactile encoder trained on large-scale simulation-synthesized data with designed supervisory signals, providing tactile-centric visuo-tactile representations for downstream manipulation tasks. In addition, we present the UniVTAC Benchmark, which consists of eight representative visuo-tactile manipulation tasks for evaluating tactile-driven policies. Experimental results show that integrating the UniVTAC Encoder improves average success rates by 17.1% on the UniVTAC Benchmark, while real-world robotic experiments further demonstrate a 25% improvement in task success.

Many existing approaches attempt to compensate through manual data augmentation or additional server-side constraints, but these strategies either introduce limited semantic diversity or increase system overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose \\textbf{LUMOS}, a parameter-isolated FedSeqRec architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs) as \\emph{local semantic generators}. Instead of sharing gradients or auxiliary parameters, LUMOS privately invokes an on-device LLM to construct three complementary sequence variants from each user history: (i) \\emph{future-oriented} trajectories that infer plausible behavioural continuations, (ii) \\emph{semantically equivalent rephrasings} that retain user intent while diversifying interaction patterns, and (iii) \\emph{preference-inconsistent counterfactuals} that serve as informative negatives. These synthesized sequences are jointly encoded within the federated backbone through a tri-view contrastive optimisation scheme, enabling richer representation learning without exposing sensitive information. Experimental results across three public benchmarks show that LUMOS achieves consistent gains over competitive centralised and federated baselines on HR@20 and NDCG@20. In addition, the use of semantically grounded positive signals and counterfactual negatives improves robustness under noisy and adversarial environments, even without dedicated server-side protection modules.

Submitted for review", "summary": "Automated change detection in remote sensing imagery is critical for urban management, environmental monitoring, and disaster assessment. While deep learning models have advanced this field, they often struggle with challenges like low sensitivity to small objects and high computational costs. This paper presents SCA-Net, an enhanced architecture built upon the Change-Agent framework for precise building and road change detection in bi-temporal images. Our model incorporates several key innovations: a novel Difference Pyramid Block for multi-scale change analysis, an Adaptive Multi-scale Processing module combining shape-aware and high-resolution enhancement blocks, and multi-level attention mechanisms (PPM and CSAGate) for joint contextual and detail processing. Furthermore, a dynamic composite loss function and a four-phase training strategy are introduced to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. Comprehensive evaluations on the LEVIR-CD and LEVIR-MCI datasets demonstrate SCA-Net's superior performance over Change-Agent and other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a significant 2.64% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on LEVIR-MCI and a remarkable 57.9% increase in IoU for small buildings, while reducing the training time by 61%.

We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $\u03c1=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale).

The key idea is \\emph{leakage-free state prediction}: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines.

While in specific settings, Shampoo and Muon reduce to spectral descent analogous to how Adam and Signum reduce to sign descent, their general relationship and relative data efficiency under controlled settings remain unclear. Through extensive experiments on language models, we demonstrate that Shampoo achieves higher token efficiency than Muon, mirroring Adam's advantage over Signum. We show that Shampoo's update applied to weight matrices can be decomposed into an adapted Muon update. Consistent with this, Shampoo's benefits can be exclusively attributed to its application to weight matrices, challenging interpretations agnostic to parameter shapes. This admits a new perspective that also avoids shortcomings of related interpretations based on variance adaptation and whitening: rather than enforcing semi-orthogonality as in spectral descent, Shampoo's updates are time-averaged semi-orthogonal in expectation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86Shampoo\u548cMuon\u4e24\u79cd\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Shampoo\u5728token\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eMuon\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5f62\u72b6\u65e0\u5173\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05Shampoo\u4e0eMuon\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790Shampoo\u4e0eMuon\u7684token\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5bf9Shampoo\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0eMuon\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u534a\u6b63\u4ea4\u2019\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "result": "Shampoo\u5728token\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u9ad8\u4e8eMuon\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u5b8c\u5168\u6765\u81ea\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1bShampoo\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9002\u914d\u540e\u7684Muon\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u5176\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u610f\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u534a\u6b63\u4ea4\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8c31\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "Shampoo\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5ffd\u7565\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u2018\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u534a\u6b63\u4ea4\u2019\u89c6\u89d2\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u89c4\u907f\u4e86\u65b9\u5dee\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u767d\u5316\u7b49\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module. This mechanism weights each distortion-specific feature as per its perceptual impact, ensuring that the final quality prediction aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging BIQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DR.Experts over current methods and showcase its excellence in terms of generalization and data efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDR.Experts\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5931\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76f2\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08BIQA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5931\u771f\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5931\u771f\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6309\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709BIQA\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u5931\u771f\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3b\u56e0\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5931\u771f\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3001\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u89c2\u5224\u65ad\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDR.Experts\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u5931\u771f\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5931\u771f-\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u79bb\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5931\u771f\u8868\u5f81\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5931\u771f\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u5757\uff08MoE\u98ce\u683c\uff09\u878d\u5408\u5931\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u6865\u63a5\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6309\u611f\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41BIQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u52a0\u6743\u5931\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0cDR.Experts\u4e3aBIQA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This underrepresented downstream task addresses the subcategory of meta-scientific questions concerning the \"science of science.\" When compared to traditional scientific question answering based on papers, the task poses unique challenges in the planning phase. Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses. As a database for retrieval-augmented generation, we leverage a proprietary research performance assessment platform.

Depth sensors suffer from noise and material sensitivity, while existing reconstruction models lack the precision and metric consistency required for physical interaction. We introduce Robo3R, a feed-forward, manipulation-ready 3D reconstruction model that predicts accurate, metric-scale scene geometry directly from RGB images and robot states in real time. Robo3R jointly infers scale-invariant local geometry and relative camera poses, which are unified into the scene representation in the canonical robot frame via a learned global similarity transformation. To meet the precision demands of manipulation, Robo3R employs a masked point head for sharp, fine-grained point clouds, and a keypoint-based Perspective-n-Point (PnP) formulation to refine camera extrinsics and global alignment. Trained on Robo3R-4M, a curated large-scale synthetic dataset with four million high-fidelity annotated frames, Robo3R consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction methods and depth sensors. Across downstream tasks including imitation learning, sim-to-real transfer, grasp synthesis, and collision-free motion planning, we observe consistent gains in performance, suggesting the promise of this alternative 3D sensing module for robotic manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Robo3R\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684RGB+\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u9a71\u52a8\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6750\u8d28\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u64cd\u4f5c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "Robo3R\u91c7\u7528\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u76f8\u5bf9\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\u7edf\u4e00\u81f3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672c\u4f53\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u63a9\u7801\u70b9\u4e91\u5934\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u7ec6\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5173\u952e\u70b9PnP\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u5916\u53c2\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6Robo3R-4M\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "Robo3R\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u3001sim-to-real\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u6293\u53d6\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Robo3R\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u60273D\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as a promising post-training technique; however, most existing methods apply uniform rank allocation or rely solely on static weight properties. This overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in expert utilization observed in MoE models, where frequent routing patterns and intrinsic information density vary significantly across experts. In this work, we propose RFID-MoE, an effective framework for MoE compression by exploiting heterogeneous Routing Frequency and Information Density. We first introduce a fused metric that combines expert activation frequency with effective rank to measure expert importance, adaptively allocating higher ranks to critical expert groups under a fixed budget. Moreover, instead of discarding compression residuals, we reconstruct them via a parameter-efficient sparse projection mechanism to recover lost information with minimal parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on representative MoE LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, DeepSeekMoE) across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that RFID-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods like MoBE and D2-MoE. Notably, RFID-MoE achieves a perplexity of 16.92 on PTB with the Qwen3-30B model at a 60% compression ratio, reducing perplexity by over 8.0 compared to baselines, and improves zero-shot accuracy on HellaSwag by approximately 8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRFID-MoE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u5316\u4f4e\u79e9\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6295\u5f71\u91cd\u5efa\u538b\u7f29\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347MoE\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "MoE\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5b58\u50a8\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709SVD\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u79e9\u5206\u914d\u6216\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u95f4\u5728\u8def\u7531\u9891\u7387\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRFID-MoE\uff1a1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u6784\u79e9\u5206\u914d\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6295\u5f71\u673a\u5236\u91cd\u5efaSVD\u538b\u7f29\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e22\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen3-30B\u548cDeepSeekMoE\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c60%\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0bPTB\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u964d\u81f316.92\uff08\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e\u8d858.0\uff09\uff0cHellaSwag\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea68%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eMoBE\u3001D2-MoE\u7b49SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u662fMoE\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0cRFID-MoE\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aMoE\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGloSA-sum\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff08TDA\uff09\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u52a0\u6743\u56fe\u4e0e\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u8bc6\u522b\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5229\u4e8eLLM\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6458\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u6216\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u53d7\u635f\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u800c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u52a0\u6743\u53e5\u5d4c\u5165\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u8bc6\u522b\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5b58\u5165\u2018\u4fdd\u62a4\u6c60\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6458\u8981\u4e3b\u5e72\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u62d3\u6251\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u53e5\u5b50\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u878d\u5408\u6bb5\u7ea7\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6458\u8981\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cGloSA-sum\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7f29\u77edLLM\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GloSA-sum\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u5165\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u6458\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Human manipulation videos, as a direct carrier of manipulation knowledge, offer significant potential for scaling up robot learning. However, the substantial embodiment gap between human hands and robotic dexterous hands makes direct pretraining from human videos extremely challenging. To bridge this gap and unleash the potential of large-scale human manipulation video data, we propose DexImit, an automated framework that converts monocular human manipulation videos into physically plausible robot data, without any additional information. DexImit employs a four-stage generation pipeline: (1) reconstructing hand-object interactions from arbitrary viewpoints with near-metric scale; (2) performing subtask decomposition and bimanual scheduling; (3) synthesizing robot trajectories consistent with the demonstrated interactions; (4) comprehensive data augmentation for zero-shot real-world deployment. Building on these designs, DexImit can generate large-scale robot data based on human videos, either from the Internet or video generation models. DexImit is capable of handling diverse manipulation tasks, including tool use (e.g., cutting an apple), long-horizon tasks (e.g., making a beverage), and fine-grained manipulations (e.g., stacking cups).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDexImit\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u76ee\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u867d\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u5374\u56e0\u4eba\u624b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u5728\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\uff08embodiment gap\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "DexImit\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a(1) \u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u8fd1\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b(2) \u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u53cc\u624b\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1b(3) \u5408\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u6f14\u793a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b(4) \u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "DexImit\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u6216\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\uff08\u5207\u82f9\u679c\uff09\u3001\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5236\u4f5c\u996e\u6599\uff09\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u53e0\u676f\u5b50\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "DexImit\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u6d77\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an \"emotion-then-AU\" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques.

While MSA as the standard written variety is commonly used in formal settings, people speak and write online in various dialects that are spread across the Arab region. This poses limitations for Arabic LMs, since its dialects vary in their similarity to MSA. In this work we study cross-lingual transfer of Arabic models using probing on 3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks, and representational similarity. Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects. This questions their degree of similarity, and raises concerns for cross-lingual transfer in Arabic models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u65b9\u8a00\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\uff08MSA\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ca\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u8a00\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d1f\u5411\u5e72\u6270\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\uff08MSA\uff09\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u5927\u91cf\u6d89\u53ca\u5730\u57df\u6027\u65b9\u8a00\uff1b\u65b9\u8a00\u4e0eMSA\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8de8\u65b9\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57283\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790\uff08probing\uff09\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u5728MSA\u4e0e\u5404\u65b9\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5730\u7406\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u8a00\u95f4\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u7531\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u591a\u65b9\u8a00\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u8d1f\u5411\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u8a00\u95f4\u5e76\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u65b9\u8a00\u4e0eMSA\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u65b9\u8a00\u95f4\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u65b9\u8a00\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7b80\u5355\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

While this paradigm has advanced robot-arm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, data-hungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EgoHumanoid, the first framework to co-train a vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with a limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce a systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\\%, particularly in unseen environments.

This can be problematic when contributors are dependent (e.g., reused/augmented data or causal feature orderings) or when contributions should be adjusted by factors such as trust or risk. We propose Priority-Aware Shapley Value (PASV), which incorporates both hard precedence constraints and soft, contributor-specific priority weights.

However, due to the strong prior of large language models (LLMs) and misaligned attention across modalities, LVLMs often generate outputs inconsistent with visual content - termed hallucination. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schr\u00f6dinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable.

We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -> 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -> 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings. These results highlight scalable spatially guided training as a promising direction for robust, generalizable robot learning.

To appear in Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD '26)", "summary": "The absence of pre-hospital physiological data in standard clinical datasets fundamentally constrains the early prediction of stroke, as patients typically present only after stroke has occurred, leaving the predictive value of continuous monitoring signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) unvalidated. In this work, we overcome this limitation by focusing on a rare but clinically critical cohort - patients who suffered stroke during hospitalization while already under continuous monitoring - thereby enabling the first large-scale analysis of pre-stroke PPG waveforms aligned to verified onset times. Using MIMIC-III and MC-MED, we develop an LLM-assisted data mining pipeline to extract precise in-hospital stroke onset timestamps from unstructured clinical notes, followed by physician validation, identifying 176 patients (MIMIC) and 158 patients (MC-MED) with high-quality synchronized pre-onset PPG data, respectively. We then extract hemodynamic features from PPG and employ a ResNet-1D model to predict impending stroke across multiple early-warning horizons. The model achieves F1-scores of 0.7956, 0.8759, and 0.9406 at 4, 5, and 6 hours prior to onset on MIMIC-III, and, without re-tuning, reaches 0.9256, 0.9595, and 0.9888 on MC-MED for the same horizons. These results provide the first empirical evidence from real-world clinical data that PPG contains predictive signatures of stroke several hours before onset, demonstrating that passively acquired physiological signals can support reliable early warning, supporting a shift from post-event stroke recognition to proactive, physiology-based surveillance that may materially improve patient outcomes in routine clinical care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u4f4f\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u7a81\u53d1\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53d1\u75c5\u524d\u7684PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eResNet-1D\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728MIMIC-III\u548cMC-MED\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8F1-score\u7684\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660ePPG\u5177\u6709\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9662\u524d\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff1bPPG\u7b49\u8fde\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\u5c1a\u672a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u7ecf\u533b\u751f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff1b\u5728MIMIC-III\u548cMC-MED\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5171334\u4f8b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u540c\u6b65PPG\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u63d0\u53d6PPG\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ResNet-1D\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\uff084/5/6\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728MIMIC-III\u4e0a4/5/6\u5c0f\u65f6\u524dF1-score\u8fbe0.7956/0.8759/0.9406\uff1b\u5728MC-MED\u4e0a\uff08\u672a\u8c03\u53c2\uff09\u8fbe0.9256/0.9595/0.9888\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cPPG\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "PPG\u4fe1\u53f7\u8574\u542b\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u524d\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u4e8b\u4ef6\u540e\u8bc6\u522b\u8f6c\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u540e\u3002"}}

The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts.

We investigate quantification in Mandarin Chinese using a picture-based elicited description task in which speakers freely described scenes containing multiple objects, without explicit instructions to count or quantify. Across both spoken and written modalities, we examine three aspects of quantification: whether speakers choose to quantify at all, how precise their quantification is, and which quantificational strategies they adopt. Results show that object numerosity, animacy, and production modality systematically shape quantificational behaviour. In particular, increasing numerosity reduces both the likelihood and the precision of quantification, while animate referents and modality selectively modulate strategy choice. This study demonstrates how quantification can be examined under unconstrained production conditions and provides a naturalistic dataset for further analyses of quantity expression in language production.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7247\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u6c49\u8bed\u6bcd\u8bed\u8005\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u51fa\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u53ca\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u751f\u547d\u6027\u53ca\u4ea7\u51fa\u6a21\u6001\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u65e5\u5e38\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u51fa\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u91cf\u5316\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u8bf1\u53d1\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8ba9\u6c49\u8bed\u6bcd\u8bed\u8005\u81ea\u7531\u63cf\u8ff0\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff08\u65e0\u8ba1\u6570\u6216\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\uff0c\u8de8\u53e3\u8bed\u4e0e\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u6a21\u6001\u8003\u5bdf\u91cf\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u91cf\u5316\u503e\u5411\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff1b\u6709\u751f\u6027\u6307\u79f0\u7269\u53ca\u4ea7\u51fa\u6a21\u6001\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u8c03\u8282\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u53e3\u8bed\u4e0e\u4e66\u9762\u8bed\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u8bed\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982 numerosity\u3001animacy\u3001modality\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u51fa\u4e2d\u6570\u91cf\u8868\u8fbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, even with precise modeling, fixed policies remain susceptible to out-of-distribution scenarios, ranging from external aerodynamic disturbances to internal hardware degradation. To ensure safety under these evolving uncertainties, such controllers are forced to operate with conservative safety margins, inherently constraining their agility outside of controlled settings. While online adaptation offers a potential remedy, safely exploring physical limits remains a critical bottleneck due to data scarcity and safety risks. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-adaptive framework that eliminates the need for precise system identification or offline Sim2Real transfer. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Scaling (ATS) to actively explore platform physical limits, and employ online residual learning to augment a simple nominal model. {Based on the learned hybrid model, we further propose Real-world Anchored Short-horizon Backpropagation Through Time (RASH-BPTT) to achieve efficient and robust in-flight policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our quadrotor reliably executes agile maneuvers near actuator saturation limits. The system evolves a conservative base policy with a peak speed of 1.9 m/s to 7.3 m/s within approximately 100 seconds of flight time. These findings underscore that real-world adaptation serves not merely to compensate for modeling errors, but as a practical mechanism for sustained performance improvement in aggressive flight regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u548c\u79bb\u7ebfSim2Real\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\uff08ATS\uff09\u63a2\u7d22\u5e73\u53f0\u7269\u7406\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eRASH-BPTT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u7ea6100\u79d2\u5185\u5c06\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u5cf0\u503c\u901f\u5ea6\u4ece1.9 m/s\u63d0\u5347\u81f37.3 m/s\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0Sim2Real\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6c14\u6d41\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u9000\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u4fdd\u5b88\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u727a\u7272\u654f\u6377\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53c8\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u98de\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\uff08ATS\uff09\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u7269\u7406\u6781\u9650\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u7ebf\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7b80\u5355\u540d\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1Real-world Anchored Short-horizon BPTT\uff08RASH-BPTT\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u673a\u4e0a\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u53ef\u9760\u6267\u884c\u8fd1\u6267\u884c\u5668\u9971\u548c\u6781\u9650\u7684\u654f\u6377\u673a\u52a8\uff1b\u5728\u7ea6100\u79d2\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u5cf0\u503c\u901f\u5ea6\u75311.9 m/s\u63d0\u5347\u81f37.3 m/s\u3002", "conclusion": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u8865\u507f\u5efa\u6a21\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6fc0\u8fdb\u98de\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Outlier detection (OD) on tabular data underpins numerous real-world applications, yet existing OD benchmarks remain limited. The prominent OD benchmark AdBench is the de facto standard in the literature, yet comprises only 57 datasets. In addition to other shortcomings discussed in this work, its small scale severely restricts diversity and statistical power. We introduce MacrOData, a large-scale benchmark suite for tabular OD comprising three carefully curated components: OddBench, with 790 datasets containing real-world semantic anomalies; OvrBench, with 856 datasets featuring real-world statistical outliers; and SynBench, with 800 synthetically generated datasets spanning diverse data priors and outlier archetypes. Owing to its scale and diversity, MacrOData enables comprehensive and statistically robust evaluation of tabular OD methods. Our benchmarks further satisfy several key desiderata: We provide standardized train/test splits for all datasets, public/private benchmark partitions with held-out test labels for the latter reserved toward an online leaderboard, and annotate our datasets with semantic metadata. We conduct extensive experiments across all benchmarks, evaluating a broad range of OD methods comprising classical, deep, and foundation models, over diverse hyperparameter configurations.

Existing medical image editing datasets often suffer from limited diversity, neglect of medical image understanding and inability to balance quality with scalability. To address these gaps, we propose MieDB-100k, a large-scale, high-quality and diverse dataset for text-guided medical image editing. It categorizes editing tasks into perspectives of Perception, Modification and Transformation, considering both understanding and generation abilities.

To address this limitation, we introduce a corpus of 2,344 Sinhala figures of speech with cultural and cross-lingual annotations. We examine this dataset to classify the cultural origins of the figures of speech and to identify their cross-lingual equivalents. Additionally, we have developed a binary classifier to differentiate between two types of FOS in the dataset, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 92%. We also evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this dataset.

The main focus of PB is designing rules, functions that return feasible budget allocations for a set of projects subject to some budget constraint. Designing PB rules that optimize both utility and fairness objectives based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and the proven trade-off between the two notions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design. Given the resemblance of PB rules to algorithms for classical knapsack problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, named LLMRule, that addresses the limitations of existing works by incorporating LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure for automating the design of PB rules. Our experimental results, evaluated on more than 600 real-world PB instances obtained from the U.S., Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands with different representations of agent preferences, demonstrate that the LLM-generated rules generally outperform existing handcrafted rules in terms of overall utility while still maintaining a similar degree of fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLLMRule\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cPB\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u6548\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f0f\u9884\u7b97\uff08PB\uff09\u4e2d\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14PB\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u80cc\u5305\u95ee\u9898\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5951\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLMRule\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u7684PB\u5206\u914d\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u56fd\u771f\u5b9ePB\u6570\u636e\uff08600+\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u597d\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u4e0a\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3PB\u4e2d\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Pl\u00fccker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHand2World\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u624b\u52bf\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u56fe\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u6240\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u624b/\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6Hand2World\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u6295\u5f713D\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u5b9e\u73b0\u906e\u6321\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u9010\u50cf\u7d20Pl\u00fccker\u5c04\u7ebf\u5d4c\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u76f8\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u624b\u90e8\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u53cc\u5411\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ea4\u4e92\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e3D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "Hand2World\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While effective, such interventions often induce unfavorable attribute-utility trade-offs under strong control, as they ignore the fact that many behaviors are governed by a small and heterogeneous subset of model components. We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average. Overall, Steer2Edit provides a principled bridge between representation steering and weight editing by translating steering signals into interpretable, training-free parameter updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSteer2Edit\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8f6c\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u79e9-1\u6743\u91cd\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\uff08\u800c\u975e\u5168\u5c40\u5e72\u9884\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6807\u51c6\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5c5e\u6027-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6c\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5e38\u7531\u5c11\u91cf\u5f02\u8d28\u7ec4\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "Steer2Edit\u5c06\u8f6c\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u4ece\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e0eMLP\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u79e9-1\u6743\u91cd\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u524d\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cSteer2Edit\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe17.2%\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad89.8%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c1112.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "Steer2Edit\u5728\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u5411\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u7f16\u8f91\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u539f\u7406\u6027\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5c06\u8f6c\u5411\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u3002"}}

Conventional Digital Surface Model (DSM) and image differencing are sensitive to vertical bias and viewpoint mismatch, while original point cloud or voxel models require large memory, assume perfect alignment, and degrade thin structures. We propose an uncertainty-aware, object-centric method for city-scale LiDAR-based change detection. Our method aligns data from different time periods using multi-resolution Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) and a point-to-plane Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method, normalizes elevation, and computes a per-point level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate change decisions. Geometry-based associations are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and optimized using class-constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle split-merge cases. Tiled processing bounds memory and preserves narrow ground changes, while instance-level decisions integrate overlap, displacement, and volumetric differences under local detection gating. We perform experiments on a Subiaco (Western Australia) dataset captured in 2023 and again in 2025. Our method achieves 95.3% accuracy, 90.8% mF1, and 82.9% mIoU, improving over the strongest baseline, Triplet KPConv, by 0.3, 0.6, and 1.1 points, respectively.

However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTele-Omni\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\uff08\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u6307\u4ee4\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u6790\u5f02\u6784\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "Tele-Omni\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u9996\u5c3e\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Tele-Omni\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern.

Ensuring safety of these agents often requires localizing the pose for subsequent actions. Pose estimates can, e.g., be obtained from various combinations of lidar sensors, cameras, and external services such as GPS. Crucially, in safety-critical domains, a rough estimate is insufficient to formally determine safety, i.e., guaranteeing safety even in the worst-case scenario, and external services might additionally not be trustworthy. We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification.

However, its extra parameter perturbation step doubles the computation cost, which becomes the bottleneck of SAM in the practical implementation. In this work, we propose an approach SL-SAM to break this bottleneck by introducing the sparse technique to layers. Our key innovation is to frame the dynamic selection of layers for both the gradient ascent (perturbation) and descent (update) steps as a multi-armed bandit problem. At the beginning of each iteration, SL-SAM samples a part of the layers of the model according to the gradient norm to participate in the backpropagation of the following parameter perturbation and update steps, thereby reducing the computation complexity. We then provide the analysis to guarantee the convergence of SL-SAM. In the experiments of fine-tuning models in several tasks, SL-SAM achieves the performances comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines, including a \\#1 rank on LLM fine-tuning. Meanwhile, SL-SAM significantly reduces the ratio of active parameters in backpropagation compared to vanilla SAM (SL-SAM activates 47\\%, 22\\% and 21\\% parameters on the vision, moderate and large language model respectively while vanilla SAM always activates 100\\%), verifying the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSL-SAM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728SAM\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u53c2\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff08\u6270\u52a8\uff09\u548c\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\u7684\u5c42\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "SAM\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u6b65\u9aa4\u4f7f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSL-SAM\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u53c2\u4e0e\u6270\u52a8\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff08LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00\uff09\uff1b\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u89c6\u89c9/\u4e2d\u7b49/\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u4e3a47%/22%/21%\uff0c\u800cSAM\u4e3a100%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "SL-SAM\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347SAM\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAGMark\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5212\u5206\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u65e0\u5173\u8bcd\u5143\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u65e0\u5173\u6c34\u5370\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u65e0\u5173\u8bcd\u5143\u5e76\u7834\u574f\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5b9a\u6c34\u5370\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u957f\u5c3e\u8bcd\u5143\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAttention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking\uff08AGMark\uff09\uff1a\u6bcf\u6b65\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bc1\u636e-\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u518d\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u8bcd\u5143\u71b5\uff08\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\uff09\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08\u8bc1\u636e\u6821\u51c6\uff09\u786e\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5143\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bcd\u6c47\u5212\u5206\u3002", "result": "AGMark\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u751f\u6210\u540e\u671f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u226599.36% AUC\uff0c\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u226588.61% AUC\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "AGMark\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6c34\u5370\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bcd\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., \"pick up a bowl and place it on the table\"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI.

While this minimizes resource usage for on-device applications, it makes agents notoriously sample-inefficient, since value-based losses alone struggle to extract meaningful representations from transient data. We propose extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to the streaming pipeline to maximize the utility of every observed frame. However, due to the highly correlated samples induced by the streaming regime, naively applying this auxiliary loss results in training instabilities. Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers. Validated across the Atari, MinAtar, and Octax suites, our approach systematically outperforms existing streaming baselines.

However, existing solutions for video hate detection either rely heavily on large-scale human annotations or lack fine-grained temporal precision. In this work, we propose LELA, the first training-free Large Language Model (LLM) based framework for hate video localization. Distinct from state-of-the-art models that depend on supervised pipelines, LELA leverages LLMs and modality-specific captioning to detect and temporally localize hateful content in a training-free manner. Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame. We further introduce a composition matching mechanism to enhance cross-modal reasoning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, HateMM and MultiHateClip, demonstrate that LELA outperforms all existing training-free baselines by a large margin.

We investigate whether their own likelihood of success is recoverable from their internal representations before generation, and if this signal can guide more efficient inference. We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty.

Based on \\textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \\textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge.

Existing trajectory-level length penalties often fail to effectively shorten reasoning length and degrade accuracy, as they uniformly treat all reasoning steps and lack fine-grained signals to distinguish redundancy from necessity. Meanwhile, process-supervised methods are typically resource-intensive and suffer from inaccurate credit assignment. To address these issues, we propose ATTNPO, a low-overhead process-supervised RL framework that leverages the model's intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment.

In these fields, the goal is to generate various samples with high rewards (e.g., drug-likeness in molecules), making reward-based guidance crucial. Most existing methods are based on guiding the diffusion model using intermediate rewards but tend to underperform since intermediate rewards are noisy due to the non-smooth nature of reward functions used in scientific domains. To address this, we propose Clean-Sample Markov Chain (CSMC) Sampler, a method that performs effective test-time reward-guided sampling for discrete diffusion models, enabling local search without relying on intermediate rewards. CSMC constructs a Markov chain of clean samples using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm such that its stationary distribution is the target distribution.

We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps.

However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions.

In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization.

According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \\poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \\poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaPOS HBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5411\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u82f1\u8bed\u53e5\u6cd5\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u7591\u95ee\u53e5\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u5c9b\u5c7f\u9650\u5236\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ecd\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u513f\u7ae5\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u540e\uff0c\u53e5\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4f46\u672a\u6539\u5584POS HBench\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u2018\u5148\u5929\u8bed\u6cd5\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u901a\u5411\u6cdb\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u2019\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8c\u8d2b\u56f0\u523a\u6fc0\u5047\u8bf4\uff08PoSH\uff09\u2014\u2014\u5373\u513f\u7ae5\u4ec5\u51ed\u6709\u9650\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\u80fd\u5426\u4e60\u5f97\u6bcd\u8bed\u7ea7\u53e5\u6cd5\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u987b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5148\u5929\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaPOS HBench\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5957\u4ef6\uff08\u805a\u7126\u7591\u95ee\u53e5\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u5c9b\u5c7f\u7b49PoSH\u6838\u5fc3\u73b0\u8c61\uff09\uff1b\u572810\u201350M\u8bcd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u9002\u5b9c\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u76f4\u63a5\u6b63\u5411\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8ff9\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5747\u5f31\u4e8e\u513f\u7ae5\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u7f6e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u53e5\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5374\u672a\u63d0\u5347POS HBench\u4e0a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5148\u5929\u8bed\u6cd5\u5e76\u975e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53e5\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u53ef\u80fd\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u8981\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u672c\u6587\u672a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002"}}

The design of OE2D algorithm generalizes Falcon~\\citep{simchi2022bypassing} and its linear reward version~\\citep[][Section 4]{xu2020upper} in that it chooses an action distribution that we term ``exploitative F-design'' that simultaneously guarantees low regret and good coverage that trades off exploration and exploitation.

Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\\!-\\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\\!-\\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684N-k\u6545\u969c\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7a77\u4e3e\u7ec4\u5408\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6545\u969c\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u67d4\u6027\u8d1f\u8377\u589e\u52a0\u53ca\u8fd0\u884c\u5de5\u51b5\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfN-k\u6545\u969c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u9057\u6f0f\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u8fd0\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u6545\u969c\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u6001\u548cN-1\u6545\u969c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u79bb\u7ebf\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5728\u6709\u9650AC\u6f6e\u6d41\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u91cd\u6545\u969c\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE\u6807\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e25\u91cd\u5ea6\u7684\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86N-k\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7535\u7f51\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u5907\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6545\u969c\u7b5b\u9009\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing evaluation frameworks for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and open-ended question answering primarily rely on surface-level similarity, factual consistency, or semantic relevance, and often fail to assess whether responses provide the specific information required for domain-sensitive decisions. To address this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs along four complementary dimensions: specificity, robustness to paraphrasing and semantic perturbations, answer relevance, and context utilization. We introduce a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs spanning 40 professional roles and seven natural hazard types to support systematic evaluation. We further conduct human evaluation to assess inter-annotator agreement and alignment between model outputs and human judgments, which highlights the inherent subjectivity of open-ended, domain-specific evaluation.

This model captures environments that are stable except at a few vulnerable points. We introduce \\emph{conditioned occupancy measures}, which remain stable across episodes even with adversarial transitions, and use them to design two algorithms. The first handles arbitrary adversarial steps and achieves regret $\\tilde{O}(H S^\u039b\\sqrt{K S A^{\u039b+1}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $S$ is the number of state, $A$ is the number of actions and $H$ is the episode's horizon. The second, assuming the adversarial steps are consecutive, improves the dependence on $S$ to $\\tilde{O}(H\\sqrt{K S^{3} A^{\u039b+1}})$. We further give a $K^{2/3}$-regret reduction that removes the need to know which steps are the $\u039b$ adversarial steps.

However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes.

In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models.

Neural-operator surrogates provide resolution-robust prediction, but autoregressive rollouts can drift due to the accumulation of error, and out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions often degrade accuracy. Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems. Across these benchmarks, DDOL-ART delivers a strong accuracy and cost trade-off. It is several-fold faster than a physics-based numerical-loss operator learner (NLOL) under matched settings, and it remains competitive on both in-distribution stability and OOD robustness. Training-dynamics diagnostics show that adaptivity strengthens the correlation between validation error and OOD test error performance, acting as a feedback controller that limits optimization drift.

However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4ece\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\uff08\u5982ShuffleNet\u3001SqueezeNet\u7b49\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u800c\u6765\u7684Spiking Neural Networks\uff08SNNs\uff09\uff0c\u5728CIFAR\u548cTinyImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eSNN\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad815.7\u500d\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dSqueezeNet-SNN\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21SNN\uff0c\u800c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN-to-SNN\u8f6c\u6362\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c1a\u5c5e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9762\u5411\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u9700\u6c42\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06ShuffleNet\u3001SqueezeNet\u3001MnasNet\u548cMixNet\u7b49\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u7edf\u4e00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eLIF\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684SNN\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u5e94SNN\u53d8\u4f53\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5bf9SqueezeNet-SNN\u5b9e\u65bd\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5f97\u5230SNN-SqueezeNet-P\u3002", "result": "SNN\u76f8\u8f83\u5bf9\u5e94CNN\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534715.7\u00d7\u80fd\u6548\uff1bSqueezeNet-SNN\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u526a\u679d\u540eSNN-SqueezeNet-P\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u53476%\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1119%\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u8f83CNN-SqueezeNet\u4ec5\u4f4e1%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f46\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e88.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SNN\u662f\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d85\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u843d\u5730\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In addition, to make the reasoning process transparent, a textual explanation is necessary to justify the verification result. However, most claim verification works mainly focus on the reasoning over textual evidence only or ignore the explainability, resulting in inaccurate and unconvincing verification. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that jointly achieves evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation. For evidence retrieval, we construct a two-layer multi-modal graph for claims and evidence, where we design image-to-text and text-to-image reasoning for multi-modal retrieval. For claim verification, we propose token- and evidence-level fusion to integrate claim and evidence embeddings for multi-modal verification. For explanation generation, we introduce multi-modal Fusion-in-Decoder for explainability. Finally, since almost all the datasets are in general domain, we create a scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, in AI domain to complement claim verification community.

In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u88c2\u7eb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548cMumford-Shah\u578b\u53d8\u5206\u6cdb\u51fd\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed8\u753b\u4e2d\u88c2\u7eb9\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u7ed8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u88c2\u7eb9\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u9000\u5316\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u4fee\u590d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u573a\u666f\u590d\u6742\u53ca\u88c2\u7eb9\u4e0e\u7b14\u89e6\u3001\u53d1\u4e1d\u7b49\u827a\u672f\u7279\u5f81\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u88c2\u7eb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3a\u65e0\u88c2\u7eb9\u753b\u4f5c\u548c\u88c2\u7eb9\u6210\u5206\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u753b\u4f5c\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7528Mumford-Shah\u578b\u53d8\u5206\u6cdb\u51fd\u7ed3\u5408\u88c2\u7eb9\u5148\u9a8c\u523b\u753b\u88c2\u7eb9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ed8\u753b\u4e2d\u88c2\u7eb9\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u88c2\u7eb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u827a\u672f\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u88c2\u7eb9\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Comprehensive evaluation across 170 subdomains demonstrates that Anagent achieves substantial improvements, up to $\\uparrow 13.43\\%$ in training-free settings and $\\uparrow 42.12\\%$ with finetuning, while revealing that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific table \\& figure analysis.

[TCC 2006]) and to the statistical query (SQ) model (Kearns [JACM `98]). Statistically, it was known that differentially private learning and replicable learning are equivalent and strictly more powerful than SQ-learning. Yet, computationally, all previously known efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) replicable learning algorithms were confined to SQ-learnable tasks or restricted distributions, in contrast to differentially private learning.\n  Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient replicable algorithm for realizable learning of parities over arbitrary distributions, a task that is known to be hard in the SQ-model, but possible under differential privacy. This result provides the first evidence that efficient replicable learning over general distributions strictly extends efficient SQ-learning, and is closer in power to efficient differentially private learning, despite computational separations between replicability and privacy.

However, achieving precise control over fine-grained facial movements remains a significant challenge, particularly due to lip-synchronization inaccuracies and facial jitter, both of which can contribute to the uncanny valley effect. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting (FG-3DGS), a novel framework that enables temporally consistent and high-fidelity talking head generation. Our method introduces a frequency-aware disentanglement strategy to explicitly model facial regions based on their motion characteristics. Low-frequency regions, such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead, are jointly modeled using a standard MLP, while high-frequency regions, including the eyes and mouth, are captured separately using a dedicated network guided by facial area masks. The predicted motion dynamics, represented as Gaussian deltas, are applied to the static Gaussians to generate the final head frames, which are rendered via a rasterizer using frame-specific camera parameters. Additionally, a high-frequency-refined post-rendering alignment mechanism, learned from large-scale audio-video pairs by a pretrained model, is incorporated to enhance per-frame generation and achieve more accurate lip synchronization. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets for talking head generation demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting\uff08FG-3DGS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u4f4e\u9891\uff08\u5982\u8138\u988a\u3001\u9f3b\u5b50\uff09\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\uff08\u5982\u773c\u775b\u3001\u5634\u5df4\uff09\u9762\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u540e\u6e32\u67d3\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5507\u5f62\u540c\u6b65\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5934\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5507\u5f62\u540c\u6b65\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9762\u90e8\u6296\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u6050\u6016\u8c37\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFG-3DGS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u8026\u5efa\u6a21\u2014\u2014\u4f4e\u9891\u533a\u57df\u7528\u5171\u4eabMLP\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u533a\u57df\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e13\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u589e\u91cf\uff08Gaussian deltas\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u9759\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u53d8\u5f62\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7531\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u7ec6\u5316\u540e\u6e32\u67d3\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5934\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5507\u540c\u6b65\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FG-3DGS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5507\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u4e0e\u9762\u90e8\u6296\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, there exist large gaps between their approximate regret bounds and the regret bounds achieved in the convex setting. Moreover, if focusing on projection-free algorithms, which can efficiently handle complex decision sets, they cannot even recover the approximate regret bounds achieved in the centralized setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for D-OCSM over general convex decision sets, these two issues can be addressed simultaneously. Furthermore, for D-OCSM over downward-closed decision sets, we show that the second issue can be addressed while significantly alleviating the first issue. Our key techniques are two reductions from D-OCSM to decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO), which can exploit D-OCO algorithms to improve the approximate regret of D-OCSM in these two cases, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4ece\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u8fde\u7eed\u5b50\u6a21\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08D-OCSM\uff09\u5230\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\uff08D-OCO\uff09\u7684\u5f52\u7ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86D-OCSM\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u51f8\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u548c\u5411\u4e0b\u95ed\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u61be\u754c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u81ea\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709D-OCSM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9057\u61be\u754c\u4e0a\u4e0e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5dee\u8ddd\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u6295\u5f71\u81ea\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5c06D-OCSM\u5f52\u7ea6\u4e3aD-OCO\u7684\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u51f8\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u548c\u5411\u4e0b\u95ed\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709D-OCO\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u51f8\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u4e0a\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u9057\u61be\u754c\u5dee\u8ddd\u5927\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u81ea\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728\u5411\u4e0b\u95ed\u51b3\u7b56\u96c6\u4e0a\u7f13\u89e3\u524d\u8005\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u540e\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u7ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0cD-OCSM\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6295\u5f71\u81ea\u7531\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u903c\u8fd1D-OCO\u7684\u9057\u61be\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Despite strong empirical results, InfoNCE-based objectives introduce inherent conflicts that yield distribution gaps across modalities. In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules. We then provide a theoretical guarantee that our method acts as an efficient proxy for a global H\u00f6lder divergence over multiple modality distributions, and thus reduces the distribution gap among modalities.

However, the inherent capacity gap often limits the performance of student networks. Inspired by the expressiveness of pretrained teacher networks, a compelling research question arises: is there a type of network that can not only inherit the teacher's structure but also maximize the inheritance of its knowledge? Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization to ensure the inheritance of principal knowledge, InherNet effectively balances depth, width, and compression efficiency. Experimental results across unimodal and multimodal tasks demonstrate that InherNet achieves higher performance compared to student networks of similar parameter sizes.

We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\\%$ and $3.8\\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($\u03c1= 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u7406\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5730\u57df\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6b27\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bb6\u6837\u672c\u5360\u6bd4\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u5357\u7f8e\u548c\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5404\u56fdGDP\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u5b50\u96c6\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bcd\u8bed\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u9ad8\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Stable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u867d\u903c\u771f\u4f46\u5730\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5730\u7406\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5730\u7406\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u82f1\u6587\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u9898\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf-\u6807\u9898\u5bf9\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u56fd\u5bb6\uff1b\u5206\u6790Re-LAION\u3001DataComp1B\u548cConceptual Captions\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u572820\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fd\u5bb6GDP\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u5360\u6bd4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u6790Re-LAION\u4e2d\u56db\u79cd\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u5730\u7406\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5730\u7406\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9/\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5e76\u7528Stable Diffusion v1.3\u751f\u6210\u5404\u56fd\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u3001\u82f1\u56fd\u3001\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u5360\u6837\u672c48.0%\uff0c\u5357\u7f8e\u548c\u975e\u6d32\u4ec5\u53601.8%\u548c3.8%\uff1b\u56fd\u5bb6GDP\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5360\u6bd4\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u03c1=0.82\uff09\uff1b\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u5b50\u96c6\u540c\u6837\u504f\u5411\u6bcd\u8bed\u56fd\u5bb6\uff1b\u9ad8\u5730\u7406\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1bStable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u867d\u903c\u771f\u4f46\u5730\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u8fdc\u7a84\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7406\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b20\u4ee3\u8868\u5730\u533a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u5168\u7403\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u5730\u7406\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8003\u91cf\u3002"}}

Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that all three proposed federated Rashomon set definitions offer valuable insights, enabling clients to deploy models that better align with their local data, fairness considerations, and practical requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5c06Rashomon\u96c6\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5f15\u5165\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684Rashomon\u96c6\u5b9a\u4e49\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u3001t-\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684FL\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u5730\u9002\u914d\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Rashomon\u96c6\u4e0e\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\uff1b\u800cFL\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u635f\u5bb3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u523b\u753b\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u90a6Rashomon\u96c6\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\uff09\u3001t-\u4e00\u81f4\uff08t\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5c40\u90e8Rashomon\u96c6\u4ea4\u96c6\uff09\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\uff08\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5728FL\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684FL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6FL\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e09\u79cd\u8054\u90a6Rashomon\u96c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u5747\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u5951\u5408\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Rashomon\u96c6\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3FL\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning.

Mahoney"], "title": "Learning to Discover Iterative Spectral Algorithms", "comment": null, "summary": "We introduce AutoSpec, a neural network framework for discovering iterative spectral algorithms for large-scale numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization. Our self-supervised models adapt to input operators using coarse spectral information (e.g., eigenvalue estimates and residual norms), and they predict recurrence coefficients for computing or applying a matrix polynomial tailored to a downstream task. The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines.

However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression.

Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward \"white-box\" cardiac diagnostics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faECG-IMN\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u541112\u5bfc\u8054\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u5f62\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728PTB-XL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u201c\u9ed1\u7bb1\u201d\u7279\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\uff1b\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u66f4\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\uff08\u5982\u7279\u5b9a\u751f\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u9a8c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Grad-CAM\u3001SHAP\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faECG-IMN\uff08Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network\uff09\uff1a\u4ee5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u6743\u91cdW\uff09\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u6e21\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08transition decoder\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5bfc\u8054\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u75c5\u7406\u8bc1\u636e\uff08\u5982ST\u6bb5\u62ac\u9ad8\u3001T\u6ce2\u5012\u7f6e\uff09\uff1b\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0cW\u5373\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728PTB-XL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cECG-IMN\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u9ed1\u7bb1\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684AUROC\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fe0\u5b9e\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u8fc8\u5411\u2018\u767d\u76d2\u2019\u5fc3\u810f\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "ECG-IMN\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56AI\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures.

To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks.

However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction.

Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay.

Existing training frameworks primarily optimize for single-agent scenarios and fail to address the unique system-level challenges of MARL, including rollout-training synchronization barriers, rollout load imbalance, and training resource underutilization. To bridge this gap, we propose FlexMARL, the first end-to-end training framework that holistically optimizes rollout, training, and their orchestration for large-scale LLM-based MARL. Specifically, FlexMARL introduces the joint orchestrator to manage data flow under the rollout-training disaggregated architecture. Building upon the experience store, a novel micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline eliminates the synchronization barriers while providing strong consistency guarantees. Rollout engine adopts a parallel sampling scheme combined with hierarchical load balancing, which adapts to skewed inter/intra-agent request patterns. Training engine achieves on-demand hardware binding through agent-centric resource allocation. The training states of different agents are swapped via unified and location-agnostic communication. Empirical results on a large-scale production cluster demonstrate that FlexMARL achieves up to 7.3x speedup and improves hardware utilization by up to 5.6x compared to existing frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FlexMARL\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM-based\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026rollout\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5f02\u6b65\u5fae\u6279\u6b21\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MARL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u672a\u89e3\u51b3MARL\u7279\u6709\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982rollout-\u8bad\u7ec3\u540c\u6b65\u74f6\u9888\u3001rollout\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlexMARL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8054\u5408\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u5fae\u6279\u6b21\u5f02\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6d88\u9664\u540c\u6b65\u969c\u788d\u5e76\u4fdd\u969c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b3\uff09rollout\u5f15\u64ce\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837+\u5206\u5c42\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u5e94\u5bf9\u8bf7\u6c42\u503e\u659c\uff1b4\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f15\u64ce\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u9700\u786c\u4ef6\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65e0\u5173\u901a\u4fe1\u4ea4\u6362\u5404\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlexMARL\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u6700\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b07.3\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53475.6\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexMARL\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MARL\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLM-based MARL\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We show this is not merely an empirical regularity but a consequence of architectural necessity: transformers communicate information through linear interfaces (attention OV circuits, unembedding matrices), and any semantic feature decoded through such an interface must occupy a context-invariant linear subspace.

However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), pretrained on general-domain data, often struggle to capture category-specific anomalies, thereby limiting both detection accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-IAD, a knowledge-guided dynamic latent reasoning framework for explainable industrial anomaly detection. Reason-IAD comprises two core components. First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

We demonstrate that, unlike in the image domain where deep generative models frequently assign higher likelihoods to anomalous data, such counterintuitive behavior occurs far less often in tabular settings. We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition. Through extensive experiments on 47 tabular datasets and 10 CV/NLP embedding datasets in ADBench, benchmarked against 13 baseline models, we demonstrate that the phenomenon, as defined, is consistently rare in general tabular data. We further investigate this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, focusing on the roles of data dimensionality and difference in feature correlation. Our results suggest that likelihood-only detection with normalizing flows offers a practical and reliable approach for anomaly detection in tabular domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5373\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u4f3c\u7136\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8fdc\u5c11\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u6307\u51fa\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u4f3c\u7136\u66f4\u9ad8\uff09\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1b\u5728ADBench\u768447\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c10\u4e2aCV/NLP\u5d4c\u5165\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd413\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u901a\u7528\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u7f55\u89c1\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u662f\u5176\u8f83\u5c11\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u539f\u56e0\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u5728\u8868\u683c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u662f\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u5f31\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\uff0c\u53ef\u88ab\u5b89\u5168\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction. However, existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability. To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data.

However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFree-GVC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u53d7\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728GOP\u7ea7\u522b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5e27\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u95ea\u70c1\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFree-GVC\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ee5\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aGOP\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u538b\u7f29\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u7ebf\u7387-\u611f\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e27\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e27\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u76f8\u90bbGOP\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728DISTS\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u76f8\u8f83\u6700\u65b0\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668DCVC-RT\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e93.29% BD-Rate\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Free-GVC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u8de8GOP\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u95ea\u70c1\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Our analysis shows that BDDMs can accurately sample from the data distribution in polynomially many steps as a function of the intrinsic dimension. Empirical results corroborate these mathematical findings on both synthetic and image data, demonstrating that the noise variance is accurately estimated from the noisy image. Remarkably, we observe that schedule-free BDDMs produce samples of higher quality compared to their non-blind counterparts.

Selective state space models (SSMs) offer linear time sequence processing with input dependent gating, presenting a compelling alternative to quadratic complexity attention mechanisms. However, the design space for deploying SSMs in the TinyML regime remains largely unexplored. In this paper, BabyMamba-HAR is introduced, a framework comprising two novel lightweight Mamba inspired architectures optimized for resource constrained HAR: (1) CI-BabyMamba-HAR, using a channel independent stem that processes each sensor channel through shared weight, but instance independent transformations to prevent cross channel noise propagation, and (2) Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR, using an early fusion stem that achieves channel count independent computational complexity. Both variants incorporate weight tied bidirectional scanning and lightweight temporal attention pooling. Through evaluation across eight diverse benchmarks, it is demonstrated that Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR achieves 86.52% average macro F1-score with approximately 27K parameters and 2.21M MACs, matching TinyHAR (86.16%) while requiring 11x fewer MACs on high channel datasets. Systematic ablation studies reveal that bidirectional scanning contributes up to 8.42% F1-score improvement, and gated temporal attention provides up to 8.94% F1-score gain over mean pooling.

While scientific machine learning offers powerful nonlinear modeling tools, the control-oriented implications of different differentiable paradigms remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), and Differentiable Programming (DP) for modeling, identification, and control of power system dynamics. Using the Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system as a benchmark, we evaluate their performance in trajectory extrapolation, parameter estimation, and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) synthesis.\n  Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between data-driven flexibility and physical structure. NODE exhibits superior extrapolation by capturing the underlying vector field, whereas PINN shows limited generalization due to its reliance on a time-dependent solution map. In the inverse problem of parameter identification, while both DP and PINN successfully recover the unknown parameters, DP achieves significantly faster convergence by enforcing governing equations as hard constraints. Most importantly, for control synthesis, the DP framework yields closed-loop stability comparable to the theoretical optimum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NODE serves as a viable data-driven surrogate when governing equations are unavailable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINN\uff09\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08NODE\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08DP\uff09\u5728\u4f4e\u60ef\u91cf\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8fa8\u8bc6\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DP\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u95ed\u73af\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u4f18\uff0cNODE\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u5916\u63a8\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cPINN\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u60ef\u91cf\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5bfc\u5411\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u8303\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5355\u673a\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08SMIB\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790PINN\u3001NODE\u548cDP\u4e09\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u5916\u63a8\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u548cLQR\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7efc\u5408\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "NODE\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1bPINN\u548cDP\u5747\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4f46DP\u56e0\u5c06\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff1bDP\u5408\u6210\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u95ed\u73af\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\uff1bNODE\u53ef\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u5fae\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff1aDP\u6700\u9002\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u5bfc\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cNODE\u9002\u5408\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff0cPINN\u5219\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u89e3\u6620\u5c04\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002"}}

This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u8eab4D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u89c6\u89d2RGBD\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2RGBD\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76844D\u573a\u666f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u60f3\u8c61\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u95ed\u73af\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7eaf\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u90e8\u52063D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u76844D\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u8eab4D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\uff08RGB+\u6df1\u5ea6\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u63a8\u65ad\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57284D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u4e864D\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper proposes SCIL (Streaming Class-Incremental Learning) to address these challenges. The SCIL framework integrates an autoencoder (AE) with a multi-layer perceptron for multi-class prediction, uses a dual-loss strategy (classification and reconstruction) for prediction and new class detection, employs corrected pseudo-labels for online training, manages classes with queues, and applies oversampling to handle imbalance. The rationale behind the method's structure is elucidated through ablation studies and a comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed using both real-world and synthetic datasets that feature class imbalance, incremental classes, and concept drifts.

However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q.

Weight-space ensembling methods, such as Model Soups, mitigate this effect by averaging multiple checkpoints, but they are computationally prohibitive, requiring the training and storage of dozens of fine-tuned models. In this paper, we introduce MonoSoup, a simple, data-free, hyperparameter-free, post-hoc method that achieves a strong ID-OOD balance using only a single checkpoint. Our method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to each layer's update and decomposes it into high-energy directions that capture task-specific adaptation and low-energy directions that introduce noise but may still encode residual signals useful for robustness. MonoSoup then uses entropy-based effective rank to automatically re-weigh these components with layer-wise coefficients that account for the spectral and geometric structure of the model. Experiments on CLIP models fine-tuned on ImageNet and evaluated under natural distribution shifts, as well as on Qwen language models tested on mathematical reasoning and multiple-choice benchmarks, show that this plug-and-play approach is a practical and effective alternative to multi-checkpoint methods, retaining much of their benefits without their computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMonoSoup\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SVD\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u9ad8\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0ID-OOD\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u63d0\u5347ID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5374\u635f\u5bb3OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6743\u91cd\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Model Soups\uff09\u6548\u679c\u597d\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u591a\u4e2a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c42\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08SVD\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u80fd\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5316\uff09\u4e0e\u4f4e\u80fd\uff08\u542b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u6b8b\u4f59\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u71b5\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u5404\u5c42\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728CLIP\uff08ImageNet\u5fae\u8c03+\u81ea\u7136\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u548cQwen\uff08\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u591a\u9009\u9898\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMonoSoup\u4ee5\u5355\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u591a\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u96c6\u6210\u7684ID-OOD\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "MonoSoup\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u901a\u7528\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u83b7\u5f97\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4e3aID-OOD\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Anomaly detection in UTS plays an essential role in both data mining and system reliability management. However, existing reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods struggle to capture certain subtle anomalies, particularly small point anomalies and slowly rising anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prediction-based framework named Contextual and Seasonal LSTMs (CS-LSTMs). CS-LSTMs are built upon a noise decomposition strategy and jointly leverage contextual dependencies and seasonal patterns, thereby strengthening the detection of subtle anomalies.

To address this gap, we introduce the Laparoscopic Skill Analysis and Assessment (LASANA) dataset, comprising 1270 stereo video recordings of four basic laparoscopic training tasks. Each recording is annotated with a structured skill rating, aggregated from three independent raters, as well as binary labels indicating the presence or absence of task-specific errors. The majority of recordings originate from a laparoscopic training course, thereby reflecting a natural variation in the skill of participants.

Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step.

Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences.

A particularly well-known centrality measure is betweenness centrality, which becomes computationally prohibitive on large-scale networks. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have thus been proposed to predict node rankings according to their relative betweenness centrality. However, state-of-the-art methods fail to generalize to high-diameter graphs such as road networks. We propose BRAVA-GNN, a lightweight GNN architecture that leverages the empirically observed correlation linking betweenness centrality to degree-based quantities, in particular multi-hop degree mass. This correlation motivates the use of degree masses as size-invariant node features and synthetic training graphs that closely match the degree distributions of real networks. Furthermore, while previous work relies on scale-free synthetic graphs, we leverage the hyperbolic random graph model, which reproduces power-law exponents outside the scale-free regime, better capturing the structure of real-world graphs like road networks. This design enables BRAVA-GNN to generalize across diverse graph families while using 54x fewer parameters than the most lightweight existing GNN baseline. Extensive experiments on 19 real-world networks, spanning social, web, email, and road graphs, show that BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and up to 70x speedup in inference time over state-of-the-art GNN-based approaches, particularly on challenging road networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBRAVA-GNN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8df3\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4ecb\u6570\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u53cc\u66f2\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982\u9053\u8def\u7f51\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u9ad8\u76f4\u5f84\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u9884\u6d4b\u8282\u70b9\u4ecb\u6570\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u9ad8\u76f4\u5f84\u56fe\uff08\u5982\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u5ea6\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBRAVA-GNN\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4ee5\u591a\u8df3\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3a\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0d\u53d8\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8d85\u53cc\u66f2\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5339\u914d\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\uff1b\u6452\u5f03\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u6807\u5ea6\u56fe\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u572819\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u793e\u4ea4\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u3001\u90ae\u4ef6\u3001\u9053\u8def\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBRAVA-GNN\u76f8\u8f83SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5Kendall-Tau\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347214%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u5feb70\u500d\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1154\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "BRAVA-GNN\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u5177\u666e\u9002\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9053\u8def\u7f51\uff09\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

As one of the most successful deep reinforcement-learning algorithm, the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) clips the policy gradient within a conservative on-policy updates, which ensures reliable and stable policy improvement. However, this training pattern may sacrifice sample efficiency. On the other hand, off-policy methods make more adequate use of data through sample reuse, though at the cost of increased the estimation variance and bias. To leverage the advantages of both, in this paper, we propose a new PPO variant based on the stability guarantee from conservative on-policy iteration with a more efficient off-policy data utilization. Specifically, we first derive an extended off-policy improvement from an expectation form of generalized policy improvement lower bound. Then, we extend the clipping mechanism with segmented exponential functions for a suitable surrogate objective function.

Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes. Our transport cost blends (i) size-normalized geometry, (ii) local registration trust from the deformation-field Jacobian, and (iii) optional patch-level appearance consistency. The resulting transport plan is sparsified by relative pruning, yielding one-to-one matches as well as new, disappearing, merging, and splitting lesions without retraining or heuristic rules. On longitudinal CT data, our approach achieves consistently higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores versus distance-only baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08UOT\uff09\u7684\u6ce8\u518c\u611f\u77e5\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u7eb5\u5411CT\u626b\u63cf\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u5efa\u7acb\u75c5\u7076\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5904\u7406\u75c5\u7076\u51fa\u73b0\u3001\u6d88\u5931\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u4e0e\u5206\u88c2\u7b49\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u5206\u5339\u914d\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u75c5\u7076\u51fa\u73b0\u3001\u6d88\u5931\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u6216\u5206\u88c2\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u9760\u5bf9\u5e94\uff1b\u800c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u75c5\u7076\u6f14\u5316\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u54cd\u5e94\u5224\u65ad\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08UOT\uff09\u7684\u6ce8\u518c\u611f\u77e5\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u914d\u51c6\u53d8\u5f62\u573aJacobian\u6240\u53cd\u6620\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u9009\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7ea7\u5916\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u8f93\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u526a\u679d\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\u53ca\u65b0/\u6d88\u5931/\u5408\u5e76/\u5206\u88c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7eb5\u5411CT\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001\u75c5\u7076\u72b6\u6001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001\u75c5\u7076\u56fe\u8fde\u901a\u7ec4\u4ef6F1\u5206\u6570\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eUOT\u7684\u6ce8\u518c\u611f\u77e5\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u5efa\u6a21\u75c5\u7076\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u7eb5\u5411\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment.

This framework facilitates the optimization of the vision backbone via lightweight task heads with multi-granularity supervision; (iii) extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding a versatile vision backbone suited for both language-mediated reasoning and pixel-level understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faVersaViT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76MLLMs\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVersaViT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u5934\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "VersaViT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u517c\u5177\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MLLMs\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u867d\u5728\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff1bVersaViT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u8be5\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u51fa\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3002"}}

While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific \"vascular fingerprint\" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models. Crucially, our method successfully suppresses false positives from mucosal folds that dynamically appear and vanish as the bladder fills and empties during surgery. Hence, HAC provides the reliable structural stability required for clinical navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b-\u5377\u79ef\uff08HAC\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8180\u80f1\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u8840\u7ba1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8180\u80f1\u764c\u672f\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40\u8840\u7ba1\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0eCNN\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u4fee\u590d\u7ec6\u5c0f\u8840\u7ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728BlaVeS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0eclDice\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u9ecf\u819c\u76b1\u8936\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8180\u80f1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u800c\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u4e0b\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u8840\u7ba1\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u2018\u8840\u7ba1\u6307\u7eb9\u2019\u7528\u4e8e\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8840\u7ba1\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u6c14\u6ce1/\u5149\u7167\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u5f62\u53d8\u53ca\u6613\u4e0e\u8840\u7ba1\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u9ecf\u819c\u76b1\u8936\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHybrid Attention-Convolution\uff08HAC\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff1aTransformer\u6a21\u5757\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u8840\u7ba1\u62d3\u6251\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5254\u9664\u77ed/\u672b\u7aef\u5206\u652f\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff09\uff0cCNN\u6a21\u5757\u5b66\u4e60\u6b8b\u5dee\u7cbe\u4fee\u56fe\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u5c0f\u8840\u7ba1\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728BlaVeS\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHAC\u8fbe\u52300.94\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u30010.61\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u548c0.66 clDice\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u56e0\u8180\u80f1\u5145\u76c8/\u6392\u7a7a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9ecf\u819c\u76b1\u8936\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HAC\u4e3a\u8180\u80f1\u764c\u672f\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u5907\u7ed3\u6784\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8840\u7ba1\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53d8\u5f62\u7a7a\u8154\u5668\u5b98\u5185\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

Although diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating realistic medical images, their internal decision making process remains largely opaque. We present a faithfulness-based explainability framework that analyzes how prototype-based explainability methods like ProtoPNet (PPNet), Enhanced ProtoPNet (EPPNet), and ProtoPool can link the relationship between generated and training features. Our study focuses on understanding the reasoning behind image formation through denoising trajectory of diffusion model and subsequently prototype explainability with faithfulness analysis. Experimental analysis shows that EPPNet achieves the highest faithfulness (with score 0.1534), offering more reliable insights, and explainability into the generative process. The results highlight that diffusion models can be made more transparent and trustworthy through faithfulness-based explanations, contributing to safer and more interpretable applications of generative AI in healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728MRI\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0EPPNet\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff080.1534\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597AI\u4e2d\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u539f\u578b\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ProtoPNet\u3001EPPNet\u3001ProtoPool\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "EPPNet\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff080.1534\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3YOLOv11\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fb7\u56fd\u70d8\u7119\u98df\u54c1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fb7\u56fd\u9762\u5305\u5e97\u9700\u76d1\u63a7\u5269\u4f59\u4ea7\u54c1\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u70d8\u7119\u54c1\u7c7b\u7e41\u591a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u96be\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5982OWLv2\u3001Grounding DINO\uff09\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9002\u914d\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4f4e\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u7ed3\u5408OWLv2\u4e0eGrounding DINO\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528Segment Anything 2\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89d2\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u9009\u7528YOLOv11\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u65f6mAP\u8fbe0.91\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534719.3%\uff0c\u4e14\u6574\u4f53\u65b9\u6848\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763+\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u843d\u5730\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework.

However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u589e\u5927\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u2018\u5c3a\u5bf8-\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6096\u8bba\u2019\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728\u635f\u5931\u538b\u7f29\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u589e\u5927\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u53cd\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u2018\u8d8a\u5927\u8d8a\u597d\u2019\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u57280.6B\u81f390B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u79e9\u4e0etoken\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u71b5\u89d2\u5ea6\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6613\u7528\u81ea\u8eab\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8986\u76d6\u539f\u59cb\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff08\u5982\u2018\u767d\u8349\u8393\u2019\u2192\u2018\u7ea2\u8349\u8393\u2019\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6539\u5199\u800c\u975e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u590d\u73b0\uff08\u5982\u2018Alice hit Bob\u2019\u2192\u2018Bob hit Alice\u2019\uff09\uff1b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e3b\u56e0\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u5bb9\u91cf\u8fc7\u5269\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u662f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u662f\u4f34\u968f\u7f29\u653e\u800c\u6765\u7684\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4fdd\u771f\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5931\u6548\u3002"}}

However, manual sleep staging is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases due to EEG abnormalities and fragmented sleep, making PSG assessments a bottleneck for deploying new RBD screening technologies at scale. We adapted U-Sleep, a deep neural network, for generalizable sleep staging in PD and iRBD. A pretrained U-Sleep model, based on a large publicly available, multisite non-neurodegenerative dataset (PUB; 19,236 PSGs across 12 sites), was fine-tuned on research datasets from two centers (Lundbeck Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Center (PACE) and the Cologne-Bonn Cohort (CBC); 112 PD, 138 iRBD, 89 age-matched controls. The resulting model was evaluated on an independent dataset from the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine (DCSM; 81 PD, 36 iRBD, 87 sleep-clinic controls). A subset of PSGs with low agreement between the human rater and the model (\\k{appa} < 0.6) was re-scored by a second blinded human rater to identify sources of disagreement. Finally, we applied confidence-based thresholds to optimize REM sleep staging. The pretrained model achieved mean \\k{appa} = 0.81 in PUB, but \\k{appa} = 0.66 when applied directly to PACE/CBC. By fine-tuning the model, we developed a generalized model with \\k{appa} = 0.74 on PACE/CBC (p < 0.001 vs. the pretrained model). In DCSM, mean and median \\k{appa} increased from 0.60 to 0.64 (p < 0.001) and 0.64 to 0.69 (p < 0.001), respectively. In the interrater study, PSGs with low agreement between the model and the initial scorer showed similarly low agreement between human scorers.

However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFake-HR1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u6df7\u5408\u5fae\u8c03+\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u5bf9\u660e\u663e\u4f2a\u9020\u56fe\u50cf\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFake-HR1\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\uff08HFT\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08HGRPO\uff09\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4f55\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "Fake-HR1\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Fake-HR1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86DDQN\u548cDueling DQN\u5728\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DDQN\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800cDueling DQN\u5219\u4e00\u81f4\u51fa\u73b0\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u8868\u660e\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff08DDQN vs Dueling DQN\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u4e3a\u4f55\u8fc1\u79fb\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u5728CartPole\uff08\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u5230LunarLander\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5c42\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u8fc1\u79fb\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "DDQN\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u907f\u514d\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1bDueling DQN\u5219\u4e00\u81f4\u51fa\u73b0\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e8c\u8005\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6240\u8003\u5bdf\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u8fc1\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods.\n  Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases.

However, the high deployment cost hinders their scalability. To tackle the issues, Spatial Interpolation (SI) introduces virtual sensors to infer readings from observed sensors, leveraging graph structure. However, current graph-based SI methods rely on pre-trained models, lack adaptation to larger and unseen graphs at test-time, and overlook test data utilization. To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging semantic reasoning to generate unbounded operators, existing methods fail to construct free-form FE pipelines, remaining confined to isolated subtasks such as feature generation. Most importantly, they are rarely optimized jointly with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of the ML model, leading to greedy \"FE-then-HPO\" workflows that cannot capture strong FE-HPO interactions. In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML. CoFEH uses an LLM-driven FE optimizer powered by Tree of Thought (ToT) to explore flexible FE pipelines, a Bayesian optimization (BO) module to solve HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector that realizes interleaved optimization by adaptively scheduling FE and HPO steps. Crucially, we introduce a mutual conditioning mechanism that shares context between LLM and BO, enabling mutually informed decisions.

In this work, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism that extends transformer attention blocks to incorporate multi-frame context, enabling robust temporal feature representations for video semantic segmentation. Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines.

While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial.\n  In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization.\n  The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on artifact cues to detect spliced or forged areas, Forensim is designed to capture duplication patterns crucial for understanding context. In scenarios such as protest imagery, detecting only the forged region, for example a duplicated act of violence inserted into a peaceful crowd, can mislead interpretation, highlighting the need for joint source-target localization. Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture. We propose a visual state-space model that leverages normalized attention maps to identify internal similarities, paired with a region-based block attention module to distinguish manipulated regions.

Using synthetically generated processes with known temporal and cross-sectional dependency structures and varying signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct bootstrapped experiments that enable direct evaluation via out-of-sample correlations with the optimal ground-truth predictor. We show that two-way attention transformers, which alternate between temporal and cross-sectional self-attention, can outperform standard baselines-Lasso, boosting methods, and fully connected multilayer perceptrons-across a wide range of settings, including low signal-to-noise regimes. We further introduce a dynamic sparsification procedure for attention matrices applied during training, and demonstrate that it becomes significantly effective in noisy environments, where the correlation between the target variable and the optimal predictor is on the order of a few percent. Analysis of the learned attention patterns reveals interpretable structure and suggests connections to sparsity-inducing regularization in classical regression, providing insight into why these models generalize effectively under noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u51e0\u5e74\u65e5\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u4ea4\u66ff\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u73af\u5883\uff09\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eLasso\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5168\u8fde\u63a5MLP\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff08\u4ec5\u51e0\u5e74\u65e5\u89c2\u6d4b\uff09\u4e14\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u5426\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u5df2\u77e5\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7684\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u8def\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\uff08\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\uff08bootstrapped\uff09\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5916\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u6837\u672c\u5916\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b5) \u5206\u6790\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u53cc\u8def\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u5728\u5bbd\u6cdb\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff09\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eLasso\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cMLP\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ec5\u4e3a\u767e\u5206\u4e4b\u51e0\u7684\u5f3a\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u8def\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u3001\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5176\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u5206\u6e90\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9690\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion.

Mind wandering and disengagement can be detrimental to learning outcomes, making their automated detection via video-based indicators a promising approach for real-time learner support. However, machine learning-based approaches often require sharing sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training while also distributing computational load. We propose a framework exploiting cross-device federated learning to address different manifestations of behavioral and cognitive disengagement during remote learning, specifically behavioral disengagement, mind wandering, and boredom. We fit video-based cognitive disengagement detection models using facial expressions and gaze features. By adopting federated learning, we safeguard users' data privacy through privacy-by-design and introduce a novel solution with the potential for real-time learner support. We further address challenges posed by eyeglasses by incorporating related features, enhancing overall model performance. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five datasets and benchmark multiple federated learning algorithms.

Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCD\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u591a\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u6e32\u67d3\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6df1\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e8c\u8005\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeparable Causal Diffusion\uff08SCD\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u7528\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u6b21/\u6bcf\u5e27\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8d1f\u8d23\u591a\u6b65\u5e27\u5185\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSCD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5355\u5e27\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u53bb\u566a\u6e32\u67d3\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\uff0cSCD\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Classical models (Fick, Higuchi, Peppas) rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy in complex geometries and release mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE <0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE <0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise. By combining physical laws with experimental data, the proposed framework yields highly accurate long-term release predictions from short-term measurements, offering a practical route for accelerated characterization and more efficient early-stage drug release system formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINNs\uff09\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afPINNs\uff08BPINNs\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5e73\u9762\u30011D\u8936\u76b1\u30012D\u76b1\u7f29\uff09\u8584\u819c\u7684\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5408Fick\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e0e\u5c11\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u7528\u65e9\u671f6%-33%\u91ca\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u8fbe40%\uff0cRMSE<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Fick\u3001Higuchi\u3001Peppas\uff09\u56e0\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u91ca\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Fick\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165PINN\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u752810,000\u4e2a\u62c9\u4e01\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u914d\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u30011D\u8936\u76b1\u30012D\u76b1\u7f29\u8584\u819c\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5f00\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528MAE\u548cRMSE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6784\u5efaBPINNs\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "PINN\u5728\u6240\u6709\u819c\u578b\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a\u8fbe40%\uff1b\u5e73\u9762\u819c\u4ec5\u7528\u524d6%\u91ca\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u5373\u8fbeRMSE<0.05\uff08\u8282\u770194%\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\uff1b\u8936\u76b1\u4e0e\u76b1\u7f29\u819c\u5206\u522b\u572833%\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u7b49\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1bBPINNs\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ed9\u51fa\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "PINNs/BPINNs\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a7\u91ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u5feb\u901f\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u914d\u65b9\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN.

Each context is characterized by rich observable covariates yet typically exhibits only limited historical price variation, motivating the use of multi-task learning to borrow strength across tasks. A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects.\n  We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set. Our results provide guarantees for large-scale demand estimation with endogenous prices and small per-task samples, offering a principled foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDCMOML\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u751f\u6027\uff08\u5373\u5386\u53f2\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0e\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u5173\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u552e\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u9700\u4f30\u8ba1\u5927\u91cf\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u7ebf\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5404\u573a\u666f\u5386\u53f2\u4ef7\u683c\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u751f\u6027\uff08\u4ef7\u683c\u7531\u7ba1\u7406\u8005/\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e0e\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u5173\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8054\u5408\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDecision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning\uff08DCMOML\uff09\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5185\u751f\u51b3\u7b56\u5386\u53f2\uff1b\u5728\u4ef7\u683c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u53c2\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u503c\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "DCMOML\u53ef\u5728\u5185\u751f\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u6bcf\u4efb\u52a1\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5c0f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9700\u6c42\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u56e0\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u7406\u6027\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u751f\u6027\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$\u0394$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSeq\u0394-REPA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u6548\u679c\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efaOlaf-World\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u88ab\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u63a7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u4ec5\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u5185\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u5f97\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea0\u7f20\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeq\u0394-REPA\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236-\u6548\u679c\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u951a\u5b9a\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\uff08\u0394\uff09\u4e0a\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efaOlaf-World\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u88ab\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u6548\u679c\uff08\u800c\u975e\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u9f50\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff1bSeq\u0394-REPA\u4e0eOlaf-World\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In these scenarios, the continuous mapping from parameters to solutions can result in spectral bias or \"mode collapse\", where the network averages distinct physical behaviors. We propose a Topology-Aware PINN (TAPINN) that aims to mitigate this challenge by structuring the latent space via Supervised Metric Regularization. Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08TAPINN\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5ea6\u91cf\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6PINN\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u5c16\u9510\u76f8\u53d8\uff08\u5982\u5206\u5c94\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTAPINN\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7269\u7406\u6b8b\u5dee\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6PINN\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5c16\u9510 regime \u8f6c\u53d8\uff08\u5982\u5206\u5c94\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u8fde\u7eed\u6620\u5c04\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTopology-Aware PINN\uff08TAPINN\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5ea6\u91cf\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6784\u9020\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u6001\u95f4\u5ea6\u91cf\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u9690\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\uff08AO\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u8c03\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u5728Duffing\u632f\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTAPINN\u76f8\u8f83\u6807\u51c6PINN\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea649%\u7269\u7406\u6b8b\u5dee\uff080.082 vs. 0.160\uff09\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u6bd4Sobolev\u8bef\u5dee\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f4e2.18\u500d\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c115\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TAPINN\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86PINN\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios.

In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed. These run continuously online in the background, supervising the system status and recording anomalies. This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available.

Established classical methods, such as L1-IRLS and Shonan, face limitations including local minima susceptibility and reliance on convex relaxations that fail to preserve the exact manifold geometry, leading to reduced accuracy in high-noise scenarios. We introduce IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization), the first algorithm that reformulates MRA as a sequence of local quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers after binarization, to leverage inherent hardware advantages. IQARS removes convex relaxation dependence and better preserves non-Euclidean rotation manifold geometry while leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient solution space exploration. We evaluate IQARS's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

We explore the reverse: crafting training data that induces model behavior. Our framework, Infusion, uses scalable influence-function approximations to compute small perturbations to training documents that induce targeted changes in model behavior through parameter shifts. We evaluate Infusion on data poisoning tasks across vision and language domains. On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned. Taken together, these results show that small, subtle edits to training data can systematically shape model behavior, underscoring the importance of training data interpretability for adversaries and defenders alike.

To satisfy the millisecond-level response requirements of online systems while retaining the interpretable reasoning traces of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel \\textbf{Answer-First, Reason Later (AFRL)} paradigm. This paradigm requires the model to output the definitive relevance score in the very first token, followed by a structured logical explanation. Inspired by the success of reasoning models, we adopt a \"Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + Reinforcement Learning (RL)\" pipeline to achieve AFRL. However, directly applying existing RL training often leads to \\textbf{mode collapse} in the search relevance task, where the model forgets complex long-tail rules in pursuit of high rewards. From an information theory perspective: RL inherently minimizes the \\textbf{Reverse KL divergence}, which tends to seek probability peaks (mode-seeking) and is prone to \"reward hacking.\" On the other hand, SFT minimizes the \\textbf{Forward KL divergence}, forcing the model to cover the data distribution (mode-covering) and effectively anchoring expert rules. Based on this insight, we propose a \\textbf{Mode-Balanced Optimization} strategy, incorporating an SFT auxiliary loss into Stepwise-GRPO training to balance these two properties.

The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{ADORA} (\\textbf{A}dvantage \\textbf{D}ynamics via \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{R}ollout \\textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework. It significantly enhances long reasoning in both geometric and mathematical tasks, consistently achieving notable performance gains without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faADORA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebfrollout\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4e34\u65f6\u4f18\u52a3\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7528\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u6b21\u4f18\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADORA\uff08Advantage Dynamics via Online Rollout Adaptation\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578brollout\u4e2d\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7528\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u6682\u65f6\u6709\u5229/\u4e0d\u5229\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u5d4c\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cADORA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u654f\u611f\u8d85\u53c2\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "ADORA\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

From this perspective, many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, while genuine gaps arise only in specific regimes. We further argue that MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths. That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure.

Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08bAE\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\uff08FMQA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982TSP\u4e2d\u7684\u6392\u5217\uff09\u65f6\uff0cbAE\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u539f\u59cb\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "FMQA\u8981\u6c42\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982TSP\uff09\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u641c\u7d22\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\uff1b\u73b0\u6709bAE+FMQA\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21TSP\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4bAE\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u6c49\u660e\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5c0f\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "bAE\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u884c\u65c5\u884c\u8def\u7ebf\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u540c\u7b49\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5176\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u90bb\u57df\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u66f4\u5c11\uff1b\u8fd9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86bAE+FMQA\u66f4\u5feb\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4e14\u5168\u7a0b\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u8ddd\u79bb\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3001\u90bb\u57df\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff09\u662fbAE\u63d0\u5347FMQA\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In contrast to upper confidence bound (UCB)-style exploration methods, OWMs incorporate optimism directly into model learning by augmentation with an optimistic dynamics loss that biases imagined transitions toward higher-reward outcomes. This fully gradient-based loss requires neither uncertainty estimates nor constrained optimization. Our approach is plug-and-play with existing world model frameworks, preserving scalability while requiring only minimal modifications to standard training procedures.

Existing post-hoc detectors typically rely on model confidence scores or likelihood estimates in feature space, often under restrictive distributional assumptions.

We propose the Vendi Novelty Score (VNS), an OOD detector based on the Vendi Scores (VS), a family of similarity-based diversity metrics. VNS quantifies how much a test sample increases the VS of the in-distribution feature set, providing a principled notion of novelty that does not require density modeling. VNS is linear-time, non-parametric, and naturally combines class-conditional (local) and dataset-level (global) novelty signals.

Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\\sqrt{\\log(\\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time. In contrast, prior practical approximations either lack error guarantees or require quadratic runtime to guarantee such high fidelity.

Patel"], "title": "Learning on the Manifold: Unlocking Standard Diffusion Transformers with Representation Encoders", "comment": "Technical Report", "summary": "Leveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers a path for efficient, high-fidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features.

So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model. The carried out performance assessment shows improvements of FEXT-DP in terms of a faster training, i.e., numbers of rounds, Mean Squared Error and explainability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4e0e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6FEXT-DP\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u517c\u987e\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff08\u5982\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff08\u5982\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5728\u4e8c\u8005\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFEXT-DP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u6784\u5efa\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30DP\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFEXT-DP\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u3001\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "FEXT-DP\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5728\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u672a\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across six LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u9ed1\u76d2\u5f0f\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u672a\u8a00\u660e\u504f\u5dee\uff08unverbalized biases\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u81ea\u8bc4\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u504f\u5dee\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u5f0f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u5185\u90e8\u672a\u8a00\u660e\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9ed1\u76d2\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a1\uff09\u7528LLM autorater\u4ece\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u504f\u5dee\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6784\u9020\u6b63/\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u53d8\u4f53\u5e76\u5728\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u5927\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u91cd\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\uff1b4\uff09\u82e5\u67d0\u6982\u5ff5\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4f46\u672a\u5728\u6a21\u578bCoT\u4e2d\u88ab\u63d0\u53ca\uff0c\u5219\u5224\u5b9a\u4e3a\u672a\u8a00\u660e\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2aLLM\u30013\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u62db\u8058\u3001\u8d37\u6b3e\u5ba1\u6279\u3001\u5927\u5b66\u5f55\u53d6\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u6d41\u5229\u5ea6\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u3001\u5199\u4f5c\u6b63\u5f0f\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u3001\u6c11\u65cf\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}
