However, due to the subtle nature of articulatory gestures, existing lipreading methods often suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper delves into the purification of visual features from temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. We propose a novel method named Multi-Attention Lipreading Network(MA-LipNet). The core of MA-LipNet lies in its sequential application of three dedicated attention modules. Firstly, a \\textit{Channel Attention (CA)} module is employed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise features, thereby mitigating interference from less informative channels. Subsequently, two spatio-temporal attention modules with distinct granularities-\\textit{Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA)} and \\textit{Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA)}-are leveraged to suppress the influence of irrelevant pixels and video frames. The JSTA module performs a coarse-grained filtering by computing a unified weight map across the spatio-temporal dimensions, while the SSTA module conducts a more fine-grained refinement by separately modeling temporal and spatial attentions. Extensive experiments conducted on the CMLR and GRID datasets demonstrate that MA-LipNet significantly reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), validating its effectiveness and superiority over several state-of-the-art methods. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional feature refinement for robust visual speech recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMA-LipNet\u7684\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5507\u8bfb\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u3001\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e09\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5507\u8bfb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728CMLR\u548cGRID\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eCER\u548cWER\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5507\u8bfb\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u53e3\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec6\u5fae\uff0c\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5224\u522b\u529b\u5f31\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMA-LipNet\uff0c\u4f9d\u6b21\u5f15\u5165\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08CA\uff09\u3001\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08JSTA\uff09\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08SSTA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u901a\u9053\u3001\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51c0\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728CMLR\u548cGRID\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMA-LipNet\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08CER\uff09\u548c\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08WER\uff09\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7ef4\uff08\u65f6\u3001\u7a7a\u3001\u901a\u9053\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u7cbe\u70bc\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cMA-LipNet\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u601d\u8def\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u3002"}}

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5f0f\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9\u957f\u7a0b\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u6784\u9020\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u65b0\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7528\u6237\u56de\u6eaf\u65e9\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u64a4\u9500\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u8de8\u8f6e\u5f15\u7528\u5b9e\u4f53\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(i) \u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u591a\u8f6e\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u56de\u6eda\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u540d\u79f0\u7684\u8de8\u8f6e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff09\uff1b(ii) \u5386\u53f2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542btoken\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u8eab\u4efd\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b(iii) \u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6539\u8fdb\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u5efa\u5f0fDiT detokenizer\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u5f0f\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u5355\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5171\u540c\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e0\u5377\u79ef\u53cc\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6821\u6b63CT\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u50cf\u7d20\uff08LPP\uff09\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u50cf\u7d20\uff08LPP\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4CT\u56fe\u50cf\u51fa\u73b0\u73af\u72b6\u548c\u6761\u7eb9\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u6216\u6b63\u5f26\u56fe\u57df\u5355\u4e00\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565CT\u524d\u5411\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c55\u5f00\u5f0f\u53cc\u57df\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u542bLPP\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u6b63\u5f26\u56fe-\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e24\u57df\u95f4\u5185\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df1\u20132%\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LPP\u4f2a\u5f71\u6821\u6b63\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\u4e0e\u5355\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u901a\u7528\u5316CT\u4f2a\u5f71\u6821\u6b63\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Volumetric representations occupy 3D space and have a large effective receptive field along rays, enabling stable and efficient optimization via volumetric rendering; however, subsequent meshing often produces overly dense meshes and introduces accumulated errors. In contrast, pure surface methods avoid meshing but capture only boundary geometry with a single-layer receptive field, making it difficult to learn intricate geometric details and increasing reliance on priors (e.g., shading or normals). We bridge this gap by differentiably turning a surface representation into a volumetric one, enabling end-to-end surface reconstruction via volumetric rendering to model complex geometries. Specifically, we soften a mesh into multiple semi-transparent layers that remain differentiable with respect to the base mesh, endowing it with a controllable 3D receptive field. Combined with a splatting-based renderer and a topology-control strategy, our method can be optimized in about 20 minutes to achieve accurate surface reconstruction while substantially improving mesh quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5982\u7f51\u683c\uff09\u53ef\u5fae\u5730\u8f6f\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u5c42\u534a\u900f\u660e\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f53\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u867d\u5229\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u4f46\u540e\u7eed\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u8bef\u5dee\u4e14\u7f51\u683c\u8fc7\u5bc6\uff1b\u7eaf\u8868\u9762\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u4f46\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u96be\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u4e8c\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7f51\u683c\u8f6f\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u534a\u900f\u660e\u5c42\uff08\u5373\u2018\u8f6f\u4f53\u7d20\u2019\uff09\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u5176\u53ef\u63a7\u76843D\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8esplatting\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ea620\u5206\u949f\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u8f6f\u5316\u8868\u9762\u4e3a\u4f53\u79ef\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4f53\u7d20\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional benchmarks that target single answer retrieval or broad-spectrum factuality, DeepSearchQA features a dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks designed to evaluate an agent's ability to execute complex search plans to generate exhaustive answer lists. This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space. Each task is structured as a causal chain, where discovering information for one step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one, stressing long-horizon planning and context retention. All tasks are grounded in the open web with objectively verifiable answer sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations: even the most advanced models struggle to balance high recall with precision. We observe distinct failure modes ranging from premature stopping (under-retrieval) to hedging behaviors, where agents cast an overly wide net of low-confidence answers to artificially boost recall.

We introduce the \"Red-Green-Gray\" paradigm, a modification of the SPITE method, capable of classifying the validity status of nodes and edges using cheap heuristic checks, allowing fast semi-lazy roadmap updates. Given a roadmap, we use simple computational geometry methods to approximate the swept volumes of robots and perform lazy collision checks, and label a subset of the edges as invalid (red), valid (green), or unknown (gray). We present preliminary experimental results comparing our method to the well-established technique of Leven and Hutchinson, and showing increased accuracy as well as the ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u7ea2-\u7eff-\u7070\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u975e\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u534a\u61d2\u60f0\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u626b\u63a0\u4f53\u79ef\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u61d2\u60f0\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u5728\u975e\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u65b0\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSPITE\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u7ea2-\u7eff-\u7070\u201d\u8282\u70b9/\u8fb9\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u51e0\u4f55\u8fd1\u4f3c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u626b\u63a0\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u61d2\u60f0\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee5\u6807\u8bb0\u8fb9\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u65e0\u6548/\u6709\u6548/\u672a\u77e5\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4Leven\u548cHutchinson\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u8fd1\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6807\u8bb0\u65e0\u6548\u8fb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u2018\u7ea2-\u7eff-\u7070\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u534a\u61d2\u60f0\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

Pre-print", "summary": "Natural-language user profiles have recently attracted attention not only for improved interpretability, but also for their potential to make recommender systems more steerable. By enabling direct editing, natural-language profiles allow users to explicitly articulate preferences that may be difficult to infer from past behavior. However, it remains unclear whether current natural-language-based recommendation methods can follow such steering commands. While existing steerability evaluations have shown some success for well-recognized item attributes (e.g., movie genres), we argue that these benchmarks fail to capture the richer forms of user control that motivate steerable recommendations. To address this gap, we introduce SteerEval, an evaluation framework designed to measure more nuanced and diverse forms of steerability by using interventions that range from genres to content-warning for movies. We assess the steerability of a family of pretrained natural-language recommenders, examine the potential and limitations of steering on relatively niche topics, and compare how different profile and recommendation interventions impact steering effectiveness. Finally, we offer practical design suggestions informed by our findings and discuss future steps in steerable recommender design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSteerEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u8b66\u544a\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u5728\u5c0f\u4f17\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u54cd\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6307\u4ee4\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff1b\u5df2\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u8986\u76d6\u5e38\u89c1\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5f71\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaSteerEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6db5\u76d6\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u8b66\u544a\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c0f\u4f17\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u590d\u6742\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5e72\u9884\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u4fee\u6539\u7528\u6237\u63cf\u8ff0 vs \u4fee\u6539\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "SteerEval\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts: LEOPARD (n = 508), CHIMERA (n = 95), and TCGA-PRAD (n = 379). The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. Integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. Compared with guideline-based CAPRA-S, AI incrementally improved postoperative prognostication.

Yet, traditional 2D slices provide little support for interpreting spatial relationships, forcing users to mentally reconstruct anatomy into three dimensions. Direct volumetric path tracing and VR rendering can improve perception but are computationally expensive, while precomputed representations, like Gaussian Splatting, require planning ahead. Both approaches limit interactive use.\n  We propose a hybrid rendering approach for high-quality, interactive, and immersive anatomical visualization. Our method combines streamed foveated path tracing with a lightweight Gaussian Splatting approximation of the periphery. The peripheral model generation is optimized with volume data and continuously refined using foveal renderings, enabling interactive updates. Depth-guided reprojection further improves robustness to latency and allows users to balance fidelity with refresh rate.\n  We compare our method against direct path tracing and Gaussian Splatting. Our results highlight how their combination can preserve strengths in visual quality while re-generating the peripheral model in under a second, eliminating extensive preprocessing and approximations.

However, practical deployments face two persistent bottlenecks: (i) mixed-difficulty workloads where one-size-fits-all retrieval either wastes cost on easy queries or fails on hard multihop cases, and (ii) extraction loss, where graph abstraction omits fine-grained qualifiers that remain only in source text. We present A2RAG, an adaptive-and-agentic GraphRAG framework for cost-aware and reliable reasoning. A2RAG couples an adaptive controller that verifies evidence sufficiency and triggers targeted refinement only when necessary, with an agentic retriever that progressively escalates retrieval effort and maps graph signals back to provenance text to remain robust under extraction loss and incomplete graphs. Experiments on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that A2RAG achieves +9.9/+11.8 absolute gains in Recall@2, while cutting token consumption and end-to-end latency by about 50% relative to iterative multihop baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "A2RAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u5177\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u6027\u7684Graph-RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u8bc1\u636e\u5145\u5206\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Graph-RAG\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u6df7\u5408\u96be\u5ea6\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u68c0\u7d22\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u6d6a\u8d39\u6216\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u56fe\u62bd\u8c61\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9650\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff08\u63d0\u53d6\u635f\u5931\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faA2RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08\u5224\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\u662f\u5426\u5145\u5206\u3001\u6309\u9700\u89e6\u53d1\u7ec6\u5316\uff09\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff08\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u63d0\u53d6\u635f\u5931\u548c\u56fe\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728HotpotQA\u548c2WikiMultiHopQA\u4e0a\uff0cRecall@2\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53479.9\u548c11.8\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea650%\u3002", "conclusion": "A2RAG\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3Graph-RAG\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference.

Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u5408\u6210\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u5507\u52a8\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u914d\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u800c\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u914d\u97f3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u4ee5\u8f93\u5165\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u97f3\u9891\u53ca\u540c\u6b65\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u5408\u6210\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u542b\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9\u5404\u534a\u6bb5\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u9762\u90e8\u4e0e\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4fee\u590d\uff08inpainting\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u914d\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5507\u97f3\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u914d\u97f3\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eLoRA\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u97f3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u3001\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\u3002"}}

In particular, Urdu reasoning evaluation has been limited by the sensitivity of machine translation and an emphasis on general language tasks rather than reasoning benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a contextually ensembled translation framework with human-in-the-loop validation that leverages multiple translation systems to develop Urdu reasoning benchmarks while preserving contextual and structural integrity. Using this framework, we translate widely adopted reasoning and question-answering benchmarks, including MGSM, MATH-500, CommonSenseQA, and OpenBookQA, into Urdu, collectively referred to as UrduBench, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both reasoning-oriented and instruction-tuned LLMs across multiple prompting strategies. Our analysis reveals performance differences across (1) four datasets, (2) five task difficulty levels, (3) diverse model architectures, (4) multiple model scaling settings, and (5) language consistency tests. We find that multi-step and symbolic reasoning tasks pose significant challenges in Urdu, and that stable language alignment is a critical prerequisite for robust reasoning.

Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u8d5b\u9053\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8d5b\u8f66\u5355\u5708\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u65f6\u6bb5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9645\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u53ea\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u672a\u636e\u6b64\u66f4\u65b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u6784\u5efa\u8d5b\u9053\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u77ed\u5708\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4eff\u771f\uff1b\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5b9e\u8f66\u91c7\u96c6\u65b0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8f66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u79f0\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5355\u5708\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u534720.7%\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u8d5b\u8f66\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) to address the limitations of traditional relevance models, especially for long-tail and ambiguous queries. By incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, these approaches improve both accuracy and interpretability through multi-step reasoning. However, two key limitations remain: (1) most existing approaches rely on single-perspective CoT reasoning, which fails to capture the multifaceted nature of e-commerce relevance (e.g., user intent vs. attribute-level matching vs. business-specific rules); and (2) although CoT-enhanced LLM's offer rich reasoning capabilities, their high inference latency necessitates knowledge distillation for real-time deployment, yet current distillation methods discard the CoT rationale structure at inference, using it as a transient auxiliary signal and forfeiting its reasoning utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that better exploits CoT semantics throughout the optimization pipeline. Specifically, the teacher model leverages Multi-Perspective CoT (MPCoT) to generate diverse rationales and combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to construct a more robust reasoner. For distillation, we introduce Latent Reasoning Knowledge Distillation (LRKD), which endows a student model with a lightweight inference-time latent reasoning extractor, allowing efficient and low-latency internalization of the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning.

We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process.

SE models are commonly fine-tuned using SSL representations with mean squared error (MSE) loss between enhanced and clean speech. However, MSE is prone to exploiting positional embeddings in SSL models, allowing the objective to be minimised through positional correlations instead of content-related information. This work frames the problem as a general limitation of self-supervised representation fine-tuning and investigates it through representation-guided SE. Two strategies are considered: (1) zero-padding, previously explored in SSL pre-training but here examined in the fine-tuning setting, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss.

How should these diverse corpora and tasks be sampled for training? Conventional approaches sample them uniformly, proportional to their instance population sizes, or depend on human-level expert supervision. It is well known that the training data sampling strategy can greatly impact model performance. However, how to find the optimal strategy has not been adequately studied in the context of embedding models. We propose Inf-DDS, a novel reinforcement learning driven sampling framework that adaptively reweighs training datasets guided by influence-based reward signals and is much more lightweight with respect to GPU consumption. Our technique iteratively refines the sampling policy, prioritizing datasets that maximize model performance on a target development set. We evaluate the efficacy of our sampling strategy on a wide range of text retrieval tasks, demonstrating strong improvements in retrieval performance and better adaptation compared to existing gradient-based sampling methods, while also being 1.5x to 4x cheaper in GPU compute. Our sampling strategy achieves a 5.03 absolute NDCG@10 improvement while training a multilingual bge-m3 model and an absolute NDCG@10 improvement of 0.94 while training all-MiniLM-L6-v2, even when starting from expert-assigned weights on a large pool of training datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aInf-DDS\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eGPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6309\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6bd4\u4f8b\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff09\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInf-DDS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u76ee\u6807\u5f00\u53d1\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11GPU\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3bge-m3\u65f6NDCG@10\u63d0\u53475.03\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3all-MiniLM-L6-v2\u65f6\u63d0\u53470.94\uff1bGPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e1.5\u20134\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Inf-DDS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/.

However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

However, existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we propose ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach that partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration. Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity.

Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms (WMRAs) and wheelchairs separately, integrated and unified control of the combination using machine learning models remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples. To demonstrate the potential of the WheelArm dataset, we implement a baseline model for action prediction in the mustard-picking task. The results illustrate that data collected from WheelArm-Sim is feasible for a data-driven machine learning model for integrated control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WheelArm\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5373\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u8f6e\u6905\u4e0e\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08CPS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eIsaac Sim\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6WheelArm-Sim\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b13\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u3001232\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c67783\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c06\u8f6e\u6905\u4e0e\u8f6e\u6905\u642d\u8f7d\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\uff08WMRA\uff09\u5206\u5f00\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e8c\u8005\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u652f\u6301\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWheelArm\u96c6\u6210CPS\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eIsaac Sim\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6WheelArm-Sim\uff1b\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u91c7\u96c6\u6db5\u76d6\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u2018\u53d6\u82a5\u672b\u2019\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u91c7\u96c6\u5305\u542b13\u4e2aADL\u4efb\u52a1\u3001232\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u300167,783\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684WheelArm\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u2018\u53d6\u82a5\u672b\u2019\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "WheelArm-Sim\u4e3aWheelArm\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8f6e\u6905-\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

While conventional coverage formulations achieve effective spatial allocation when an accurate reference map is available, their performance deteriorates under uncertain or biased priors. The proposed method introduces an adaptive and self-correcting mechanism that enables agents to iteratively refine local density estimates within an optimal transport-based framework, ensuring theoretical consistency and scalability. A dual multilayer perceptron (MLP) module enhances adaptivity by inferring local mean-variance statistics and regulating virtual uncertainty for long-unvisited regions, mitigating stagnation around local minima. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves convergence under the Wasserstein metric, while simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AI-augmented Density-Driven Optimal Control consistently achieves robust and precise alignment with the ground-truth density, yielding substantially higher-fidelity reconstruction of complex multi-modal spatial distributions compared with conventional decentralized baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdAI\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u53cc\u5c42MLP\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8986\u76d6\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u5730\u56fe\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5efa\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5c42MLP\u6a21\u5757\u63a8\u65ad\u5c40\u90e8\u5747\u503c-\u65b9\u5dee\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e76\u8c03\u8282\u672a\u8bbf\u95ee\u533a\u57df\u7684\u865a\u62df\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\u8be5AI\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u56fe\u3002"}}

These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u5668\u68b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86YOLO\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001DeepSORT\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u5668\u68b0\u5c16\u7aef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0897%\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0cmAP 96%\uff09\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u5916\u79d1\u6280\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u8017\u65f6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u6a21\u5757AI\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b(2) \u57fa\u4e8eDeepSORT\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1b(3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u5c16\u7aef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\uff1b(4) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u68b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5668\u68b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe97%\uff0c\u5728IoU\u9608\u503c50%\u201395%\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u503c\uff08mAP50-95\uff09\u8fbe96%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0AI\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u4e2d\u5668\u68b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u5916\u79d1\u57f9\u8bad\u4e0e\u8003\u6838\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations.

We compare two approaches for creating small, multi-task code LLMs: data mixing versus model merging. We conduct extensive experiments across two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), fine-tuning them for code generation and code summarization tasks. Our evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks reveals that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scale across model families, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks while maintaining summarization capabilities. Notably, merged models can even surpass individually fine-tuned models, with our best configuration of Qwen Coder 2.5 7B model achieving 92.7% Pass@1 on HumanEval compared to 90.9% for its task-specific fine-tuned equivalent.

To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances. For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks.

Nonetheless, emerging evidence shows that CDR can inadvertently heighten group-level unfairness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis to uncover why these fairness issues arise. Specifically, we identify two key challenges: (i) Cross-Domain Disparity Transfer, wherein existing group-level disparities in the source domain are systematically propagated to the target domain; and (ii) Unfairness from Cross-Domain Information Gain, where the benefits derived from cross-domain knowledge are unevenly allocated among distinct groups. To address these two challenges, we propose a Cross-Domain Fairness Augmentation (CDFA) framework composed of two key components. Firstly, it mitigates cross-domain disparity transfer by adaptively integrating unlabeled data to equilibrate the informativeness of training signals across groups. Secondly, it redistributes cross-domain information gains via an information-theoretic approach to ensure equitable benefit allocation across groups. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and baselines demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces unfairness in CDR without sacrificing overall recommendation performance, while even enhancing it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\uff08CDR\uff09\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6839\u6e90\uff1a\u8de8\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u4f20\u9012\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faCDFA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e24\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u8350\uff08CDR\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u52a0\u5267\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u6210\u56e0\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCDFA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5747\u8861\u5404\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u8de8\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u4f20\u9012\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u8de8\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5404\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u83b7\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCDFA\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eCDR\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u3001\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CDR\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u6e90\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fc1\u79fb\u53ca\u8de8\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u5206\u914d\uff1bCDFA\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u9884\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

We redefine the system state as a probability measure over decorated rooted neighborhoods, effectively capturing local heterogeneity. Our central contribution is a theoretical foundation for scalable reinforcement learning in this setting. We prove horizon-dependent locality: for finite-horizon problems, an agent's optimal policy at time t depends strictly on its (T-t)-hop neighborhood. This result renders the infinite-dimensional control problem tractable and underpins a novel Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) on the lifted space of neighborhood distributions.

First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

I test six models including Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-4o, and open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-4.7. Enabling extended reasoning can improve accuracy by 1-3 percentage points, though effects vary across contexts; including metadata such as party registration reaches 86.7%. LLM classification also reduces the income bias inherent in BISG, where minorities in wealthier neighborhoods are systematically misclassified as White. I further validate using Lebanese voter registration with religious sect (64.3% accuracy), Indian MPs from reserved constituencies (99.2%), and Indian land records with caste classification (74.0%). Aggregate validation across India, Uganda, Nepal, Armenia, Chile, and Costa Rica using original full-count voter rolls demonstrates that the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive.

Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u5730\u5e73\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08MHE\uff09\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u98ce\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08MPC\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u54082\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u79fb\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u673a\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u59ff\u6001\u4e0e\u822a\u5411\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u98ce\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPID\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f7b\u4e8e\u7a7a\u6c14\uff08LTA\uff09\u98de\u884c\u5668\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6c14\u7403\uff09\u867d\u5177\u5907\u957f\u7eed\u822a\u548c\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u98ce\u6270\u6781\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8865\u507f\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cdMHE-MPC\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aMHE\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u98ce\u6270\u52a8\uff1bMPC\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u822a\u5411\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u91c7\u75282\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u79fb\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u673a\u6784\u4ea7\u751f\u60ef\u6027\u4e0e\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u77e9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u59ff\u6001\u4e0e\u822a\u5411\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fce\u98ce\u4e0e\u4fa7\u98ce\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u91cf\u98de\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0MHE-MPC\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4PID\u57fa\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u822a\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LTA\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u590d\u6742\u98ce\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u98de\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f4e\u7a7a\u81ea\u4e3b\u98de\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In multi-vector retrieval systems, both queries and documents are encoded using one embedding for each token, and similarity between queries and documents is measured by the MaxSim similarity measure. However, the improved recall of multi-vector retrieval comes at the expense of significantly increased latency. This necessitates designing efficient approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms for multi-vector search. In this work, we introduce LEMUR, a simple-yet-efficient framework for multi-vector similarity search. LEMUR consists of two consecutive problem reductions: We first formulate multi-vector similarity search as a supervised learning problem that can be solved using a one-hidden-layer neural network. Second, we reduce inference under this model to single-vector similarity search in its latent space, which enables the use of existing single-vector ANNS methods for speeding up retrieval. In addition to performance evaluation on ColBERTv2 embeddings, we evaluate LEMUR on embeddings generated by modern multi-vector text models and multi-vector visual document retrieval models.

We study a heterogeneous multi-step binary communication game where agents differ in modality and lack perceptual grounding. Despite perceptual misalignment, multimodal systems converge to class-consistent messages grounded in perceptual input. Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty. Bit perturbation experiments provide strong evidence that meaning is encoded in a distributional rather than compositional manner, as each bit's contribution depends on its surrounding pattern. Finally, interoperability analyses show that systems trained in different perceptual worlds fail to directly communicate, but limited fine-tuning enables successful cross-system communication.

To this end, we propose GeoDiff-LF, a novel diffusion-based framework built upon SD-Turbo to enhance underwater 4-D LF imaging by leveraging its spatial-angular structure. GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net architecture with convolutional and attention adapters to model geometric cues, (2) a geometry-guided loss function using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction to improve efficiency. By integrating diffusion priors and LF geometry, GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods across both visual fidelity and quantitative performance, advancing the state-of-the-art in enhancing underwater imaging.

However, existing methods typically operate at a coarse-grained layer level, which often leads to a trade-off between injecting reasoning capabilities and preserving visual capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose {FRISM} (Fine-grained Reasoning Injection via Subspace-level model Merging), a fine-grained reasoning injection framework based on subspace-level model merging. Observing that reasoning capabilities are encoded in distinct subspaces, FRISM decomposes LRM task vectors via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and adaptively tunes the scaling coefficients of each subspace through learning to realize fine-grained reasoning injection. Furthermore, we introduce a label-free self-distillation learning strategy with a dual-objective optimization using common vision-language perception datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FRISM effectively improves reasoning capabilities without compromising the model's original visual capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u89c6\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c06\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRM\uff09\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u7ea7\u522b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFRISM\uff08\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u6ce8\u5165 via \u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528SVD\u5206\u89e3LRM\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f29\u653e\u5404\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cbVLM\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea7\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u6ce8\u5165\u662f\u63d0\u5347VLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0cFRISM\u4e3aVLM\u4e0eLRM\u534f\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Landry", "Eugene Yang", "Suzan Verberne", "Andrew Yates"], "title": "LANCER: LLM Reranking for Nugget Coverage", "comment": "ECIR 2026", "summary": "Unlike short-form retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), such as factoid question answering, long-form RAG requires retrieval to provide documents covering a wide range of relevant information. Automated report generation exemplifies this setting: it requires not only relevant information but also a more elaborate response with comprehensive information. Yet, existing retrieval methods are primarily optimized for relevance ranking rather than information coverage. To address this limitation, we propose LANCER, an LLM-based reranking method for nugget coverage. LANCER predicts what sub-questions should be answered to satisfy an information need, predicts which documents answer these sub-questions, and reranks documents in order to provide a ranked list covering as many information nuggets as possible. Our empirical results show that LANCER enhances the quality of retrieval as measured by nugget coverage metrics, achieving higher $\u03b1$-nDCG and information coverage than other LLM-based reranking methods.

We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.\n  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.\n  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.\n  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.\n  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u3001\u53ef\u9009\u7f13\u5b58\u7684Planner-Auditor\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51fa\u9662\u8ba1\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51fa\u9662\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u9057\u6f0f\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u51c6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eFHIR\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0f\u56de\u6eaf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1aPlanner\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51fa\u9662\u8ba1\u5212\uff1bAuditor\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\uff08Brier\u5206\u6570\u3001ECE\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff09\u53ca\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u7c7b\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014\u5355\u6b21\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5185\u518d\u751f\u4e0e\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5dee\u5f02\u7f13\u51b2+\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4f4e\u8986\u76d6\u6848\u4f8b\u91cd\u653e\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u5faa\u73af\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4ece32%\u63d0\u5347\u81f386%\uff1b\u6821\u51c6\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff08Brier/ECE\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9519\u8bef\u51cf\u5c11\uff09\uff1b\u5dee\u5f02\u7f13\u51b2\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4fee\u6b63\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9057\u6f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Planner-Auditor\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7FHIR\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u51fa\u9662\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6d88\u878d\u4e0e\u9762\u5411\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGRDR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8bed\u4e49ID\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\uff08GR\uff09\u867d\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGenerative Recall and Dense Reranking\uff08GRDR\uff09\uff1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u914d\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49ID\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7801\u672c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u4e49ID\u6210\u4e3a\u56fe\u6587\u6865\u6881\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528Trie\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u5019\u9009\u96c6\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728TVR\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cGRDR\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7d22\u5f15\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5168\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\u52a0\u901f\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe300\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "GRDR\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u53ec\u56de\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6b67\u4e49\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u3002"}}

In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment. Follow-up probing and ablation analyses further reveal that different learning conditions lead to systematically different reliance on function words, indicating that similar performance can arise from distinct internal mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5206\u6790\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u6027\u3001\u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5173\u8054\u6027\u53ca\u4e0e\u77ed\u8bed\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u8fd9\u4e09\u5927\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u5728\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u4e09\u5927\u7279\u6027\u5728186\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4e60\u5f97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u9488\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u6027\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u8054\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u90e8\u4e09\u7279\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u4f53\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u638c\u63e1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9891\u7387\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u8054\u6027\u8d21\u732e\u5927\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u529f\u80fd\u8bcd\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u652f\u6301\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u4f3c\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u4e3b\u52a8\u8c03\u53c2\u6846\u67b6HPTune\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u975e\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u7ea7\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\uff09\u548c\u6162\u901f\u7ea7\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u635f\u5931\uff09\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u591a\u666e\u52d2LiDAR\u6d4b\u901f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MPC\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u907f\u969c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MPC\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5df2\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5931\u8d25\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u78b0\u649e\u3001\u8fd1\u8ddd\u969c\u788d\uff09\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c03\u53c2\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u4e3b\u52a8\u8c03\u53c2\u6846\u67b6HPTune\uff1a\u5feb\u901f\u7ea7\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u63a5\u8fd1\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u53c2\uff1b\u6162\u901f\u7ea7\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u591a\u666e\u52d2LiDAR\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7269\u901f\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0cHPTune\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548MPC\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u654f\u6377\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u907f\u969c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "HPTune\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u5c55\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u56f4\u4e0e\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\uff08\u591a\u666e\u52d2LiDAR\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MPC\u8c03\u53c2\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the \"divide-and-conquer\" workflow of human analysts.

In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch.

However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model.

While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aACQO\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\uff08AQR\uff09\u548c\u6392\u5e8f-\u5206\u6570\u878d\u5408\uff08RSF\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9700\u5e76\u884c/\u5e8f\u5217\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u5904\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4e14\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528RL\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faACQO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\uff08AQR\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b2\uff09\u6392\u5e8f-\u5206\u6570\u878d\u5408\uff08RSF\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7ed3\u679c\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u96be\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u826f\u597d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ACQO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLAMP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff08UAP\uff09\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u67d3\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u7d22\u5f15-\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6291\u5236\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u5168\u90e8\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u767d\u76d2\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u591a\u56fe\u50cfMLLMs\uff1b\u591a\u56fe\u50cfMLLMs\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLAMP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u67d3\u7ea6\u675f\u4f7f\u6270\u52a8token\u5f71\u54cd\u5e72\u51c0token\uff1b3\uff09\u7d22\u5f15-\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6291\u5236\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u53d8\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "LAMP\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LAMP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u56fe\u50cfMLLMs\u7684\u65b0\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches are either limited to a single language or fail to capture language-specific factors shaping intelligibility. We present a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework that integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment. The framework yields three metrics: phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and a newly proposed alignment-free measure, phoneme coverage (PhonCov). Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that PER benefits from the combination of mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment alone, and PhonCov from mapping. Further analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework captures clinically meaningful patterns of intelligibility degradation consistent with established observations of dysarthric speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6784\u97f3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528\u97f3\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u97f3\u7cfb\u7279\u5f81\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u97f3\u7d20\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6784\u97f3\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8a00\u8bed\u53ef\u61c2\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u97f3\u7d20\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08PER\uff09\u3001\u97f3\u7cfb\u7279\u5f81\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08PFER\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u97f3\u7d20\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff08PhonCov\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u6027\u6784\u97f3\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u75c5\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8a00\u8bed\u53ef\u61c2\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u8bed\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u97f3\u7d20\u4ea7\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u901a\u7528\u97f3\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u97f3\u7d20\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u97f3\u7cfb\u7279\u5f81\u8ddd\u79bb\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u7d20\u6620\u5c04\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49PER\u3001PFER\u548cPhonCov\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u3001\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u548c\u6cf0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1aPER\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u6620\u5c04+\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cPFER\u4ec5\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cPhonCov\u4ec5\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u6620\u5c04\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6784\u97f3\u969c\u788d\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6784\u97f3\u969c\u788d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5404\u6307\u6807\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We study these limitations through the example of grasping in space environments. We learn control policies directly in a learned latent manifold that fuses (grammarizes) multiple modalities into a structured representation for policy decision-making. Building on GPU-accelerated physics simulation, we instantiate a set of single-shot manipulation tasks and achieve over 95% task success with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning in less than 1M environment steps, under continuously varying grasping conditions from step 1. This empirically shows faster convergence than representative state-of-the-art visual baselines under the same open-loop single-shot conditions. Our analysis indicates that explicitly reasoning in latent space yields more sample-efficient learning and improved robustness to novel object and gripper geometries, environmental clutter, and sensor configurations compared to standard baselines.

We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance.

Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process.

Despite advances in zero-shot perception and reasoning from vision-language models, existing navigation systems still rely on single-pass scoring at the decision layer, leading to overconfident long-horizon errors and redundant exploration. To tackle these problems, we propose Dual-Stance Cooperative Debate Navigation (DSCD-Nav), a decision mechanism that replaces one-shot scoring with stance-based cross-checking and evidence-aware arbitration to improve action reliability under partial observability. Specifically, given the same observation and candidate action set, we explicitly construct two stances by conditioning the evaluation on diverse and complementary objectives: a Task-Scene Understanding (TSU) stance that prioritizes goal progress from scene-layout cues, and a Safety-Information Balancing (SIB) stance that emphasizes risk and information value.

State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6c60\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014Landmark (LMK) \u6c60\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5757\u5e76\u5728\u5757\u95f4\u63d2\u5165\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\uff08landmark tokens\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5747\u503c\u6c60\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d[CLS]\u548c\u5747\u503c\u6c60\u5316\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u6c60\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982[CLS]\u548c\u5747\u503c\u6c60\u5316\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a[CLS]\u6613\u504f\u5411\u5e8f\u5217\u5f00\u5934\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u5747\u503c\u6c60\u5316\u5219\u4f1a\u7a00\u91ca\u5c40\u90e8\u663e\u8457\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLandmark (LMK) \u6c60\u5316\uff1a\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u82e5\u5e72\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u5757\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\uff08landmark tokens\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5730\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u53d6\u5747\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "LMK\u6c60\u5316\u5728\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u4ec5\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LMK\u6c60\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training.

A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u674e\u7fa4\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MBS\uff09\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u5efa\u6a21\u76f8\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u8fc7\u6e21\uff08LGT\uff09\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u878d\u5165\u521a\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5947\u5f02\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u6b27\u62c9\u89d2\uff09\uff0c\u867d\u53ef\u7528\u5355\u4f4d\u56db\u5143\u6570\u6216\u674e\u7fa4\u79ef\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u8005\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709MBS\u4eff\u771f\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff1b\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u6784\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u878d\u5408\u674e\u7fa4\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(1) \u6784\u5efa\u63a5\u53e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u674e\u7fa4\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u53ef\u9002\u914d\u591a\u79cd\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b(2) \u57fa\u4e8eSO(3)\u00d7\u211d\u00b3\u548cSE(3)\u7b49\u674e\u7fa4\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u8fc7\u6e21\uff08LGT\uff09\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u521a\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u674e\u7fa4\u79ef\u5206\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6EOM\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u517c\u5bb9\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LGT\u6620\u5c04\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u66f4\u65b0\u5168\u5c40\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u5750\u6807\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u56db\u5143\u6570\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u77e9\u9635\u7b49\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u79ef\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u674e\u7fa4\u51e0\u4f55\u79ef\u5206\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7MBS\u4eff\u771f\u4ee3\u7801\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u671f\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \\textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \\textbf{C}entralized \\textbf{C}ritic and \\textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \\textbf{D}ecentralized \\textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

In this paper, we introduce MGSM-Pro, an extension of MGSM dataset with GSM-Symbolic approach. Our dataset provides five instantiations per MGSM question by varying names, digits and irrelevant context. Evaluations across nine languages reveal that many low-resource languages suffer large performance drops when tested on digit instantiations different from those in the original test set. We further find that some proprietary models, notably Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4.1, are less robust to digit instantiation, whereas Claude 4.0 Sonnet is more robust.

Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining.

However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to \"process hallucinations\", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches.

Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency.

However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSHARP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5371\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u800c\u975e\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u5371\u5bb3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u98ce\u9669\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5747\u503c\u6807\u91cf\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "SHARP\u5c06\u793e\u4f1a\u5371\u5bb3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u2018\u5931\u8d25\u5e76\u96c6\u2019\u7684\u52a0\u6027\u7d2f\u79ef\u5bf9\u6570\u98ce\u9669\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1b\u4e3b\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u98ce\u9669\u4ef7\u503cCVaR95\uff0c\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728901\u6761\u654f\u611f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f3011\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5176\u5c3e\u90e8\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u8d85\u4e24\u500d\uff1b\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u504f\u89c1\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u6700\u5f31\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u51fa\u88ab\u6807\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u5fc5\u987b\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u91cf\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u5c3e\u90e8\u654f\u611f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u753b\u50cf\u3002"}}

While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific.

To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments.

However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \\textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{JADE} (\\textbf{J}oint \\textbf{A}gentic \\textbf{D}ynamic \\textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \\textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faJADE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u8f6eRAG\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u540c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u8131\u8282\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u7b56\u7565-\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u56fa\u5b9a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5374\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u5668\u89c6\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u843d\u5730\u751a\u81f3\u6027\u80fd\u8d1f\u589e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faJADE\uff08Joint Agentic Dynamic Execution\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u540c\u4e00\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0 planner \u4e0e executors \u7684 co-adaptation\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eJADE\u80fd\u5c06\u5206\u79bb\u6a21\u5757\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff0cJADE\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u56fe\u50cf\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5374\u666e\u904d\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6781\u5dee\uff0c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u5de5\u94fe\u6db5\u76d6\u6570\u767e\u79cd\u5224\u522b\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u95ed\u6e90\u5927VLM\uff08\u5982Gemini\u3001GPT-5\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fdc\u900a\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90VLM\uff08\u5982Llama\u3001Qwen\uff09\u5219\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5931\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "VLMs\u5728\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5df2\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5e38\u8131\u79bb\u56fe\u50cf\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u5982\u865a\u6784\u6587\u5b57\u3001\u8bef\u8ba4\u690d\u88ab\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eGeoGuessr\u6e38\u620f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9876\u5c16\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u542b\u4e16\u754c\u51a0\u519b\uff09\u4e3a500\u5f20\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210800\u6761\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6license plate\u3001architecture\u3001soil\u7b49\u6570\u767e\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b\u91c7\u7528LLM-as-a-judge\uff08Qwen 3\u6700\u4f18\uff09\u548cVLM-as-a-judge\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u95ed\u6e90\u5927VLM\uff08Gemini\u3001GPT-5\uff09\u5730\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u843d\u540e\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90VLM\uff08Llama\u3001Qwen\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08LLM\u51ed\u771f\u5b9e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u9020\u65e0\u89c6\u89c9\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff1bQwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347VLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa4D-CAAL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b34D\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u5916\u53c2\u6807\u5b9a\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7528\u9014\u6807\u5b9a\u9776\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6807\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094D\u96f7\u8fbe-\u76f8\u673a\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u7528\u6807\u5b9a\u9776\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u9760\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u8d39\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u524d\u540e\u53cc\u529f\u80fd\u6807\u5b9a\u9776\uff08\u524d\u8868\u9762\u4e3a\u68cb\u76d8\u683c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u540e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e3a\u89d2\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u96f7\u8fbe\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u68cb\u76d8\u683c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0e\u6700\u5f3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u56de\u6ce2\u70b9\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u5916\u53c2\u6807\u5b9a\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u5b9a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\u5c06\u76f8\u673a\u5206\u5272\u6807\u6ce8\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u5b9a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "4D-CAAL\u4e3a4D\u96f7\u8fbe-\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6807\u5b9a\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we propose an auto-regressive generation approach, CausalEmbed, for constructing multi-vector embeddings. By incorporating iterative margin loss during contrastive training, CausalEmbed encourages the embedding models to learn compact and well-structured representations. Our method enables efficient VDR tasks using only dozens of visual tokens, achieving a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the unique advantages of auto-regressive embedding generation in terms of training efficiency and scalability at test time.

However, existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation often suffer from low-dimensional tactile information. To address this limitation, we propose DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework based on kinesthetic teaching. DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%. These results underscore that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DexTac\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u6559\u65b9\u5f0f\u91c7\u96c6\u591a\u7ef4\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u89e6\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u63a5\u89e6\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u5728\u5355\u624b\u6ce8\u5c04\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091.67%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5168\u9762\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u89c9\u793a\u6559\u7684DexTac\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u7ef4\u89e6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u89e6\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u878d\u5408\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5355\u624b\u6ce8\u5c04\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDexTac\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe91.67%\uff1b\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6ce8\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4ec5\u7528\u89e6\u89c9\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534731.67%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u793a\u8303\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u7ef4\u89e6\u89c9\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WorldBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u70b9\u662f\u6982\u5ff5\u89e3\u8026\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u76f4\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWorldBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a1\uff09\u6309\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u4e24\u5c42\u2014\u2014\u76f4\u89c2\u7269\u7406\uff08\u5982\u5ba2\u4f53\u6c38\u4e45\u6027\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u7c98\u5ea6\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u5728SOTA\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u88ab\u6d4bSOTA\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "WorldBench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128.

Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MatchInformer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u822a\u5411\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u906e\u6321\u4ea4\u901a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528MCC\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f/\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684 occupancy \u9884\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728Waymo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u906e\u6321\u4ea4\u901a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff08\u5982\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u6216\u8f66\u8f86\uff09\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u540c\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u591a\u6b21\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c4\u5212\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u5728SceneInformer\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51faMatchInformer\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u503c\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u4e00\u5bf9\u5e94\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\uff1b2\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u822a\u5411\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528Matthews\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff08MCC\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30occupancy\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Waymo Open Motion Dataset\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MatchInformer\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5339\u914d\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0boccupancy\u9884\u6d4b\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \\& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks.

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality.

Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIROS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5ba4\u5185\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff1a\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SLAM\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\uff0cVLM\u5219\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3001\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1IROS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u5c04\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\uff08System One\uff09\u4e0e\u6162\u901f\u5ba1\u614e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08System Two\uff09\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u8c03\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u578bVLM\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u65f6\u95f4\u7531\u8f7b\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u7b51\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIROS\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fde\u7eed\u4f7f\u7528VLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e66%\u3002", "conclusion": "IROS\u6210\u529f\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7c7b\u4eba\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5ba4\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4e3aVLM\u843d\u5730\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Mamba-based\u6a21\u578bMam-App\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u82f9\u679c\u53f6\u75c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6781\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff080.051M\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1SOTA\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7b49\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u53c8\u5e38\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u82f9\u679c\u7b49\u4f5c\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u4ea7\u91cf\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578bMam-App\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u690d\u7269\u53f6\u7247\u75c5\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728PlantVillage\u82f9\u679c\u53f6\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe99.58%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300199.22% F1\uff1b\u5728\u7389\u7c73\u548c\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u7389\u7c73F1=99.27%\uff0c\u9a6c\u94c3\u85afF1=97.01%\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u75280.051M\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "Mam-App\u6210\u529f\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6781\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Mamba\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u7aef\u667a\u80fd\u690d\u4fdd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness.

While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification.

The inherent characteristics of AMS, including floating-base dynamics, strong coupling between the UAV and the manipulator, and the multi-step, long-horizon nature of operational tasks, pose severe challenges to existing VLA paradigms designed for static or 2D mobile bases. To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models.

Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u79bb\u6563\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u5947\u5f02\u8fb9\u754c\u7684OOD\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u7f13\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u7684OTIS\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6291\u5236\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u534a\u79bb\u6563\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u6070\u597d\u5bf9\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8bef\u5224\u7684\u6839\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u57fa\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684OT\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u91c7\u6837\u751f\u6210OTIS\uff08OT-induced OOD samples\uff09\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5bf9OTIS\u65bd\u52a0\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6291\u5236\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u8f93\u51fa\u66f4\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3OOD\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5947\u5f02\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6291\u5236OOD\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While LLM-as-Judge approaches offer a scalable alternative to human feedback, they face a fundamental limitation: performance is constrained by the evaluator's own quality. If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation and enabling joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play, without external judges or ground truth.

However, this setting confines agents to a passive role, limiting their autonomy and ability to react to dynamic environmental events. To address these limitations, we introduce sound-triggered mobile manipulation, where agents must actively perceive and interact with sound-emitting objects without explicit action instructions. To support these tasks, we develop Habitat-Echo, a data platform that integrates acoustic rendering with physical interaction. We further propose a baseline comprising a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to complete these tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed baseline empowers agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events, eliminating the need for case-by-case instructions.

This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(\u03c4> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($\u03c1= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u4f2a\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u75be\u75c5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590d\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e14\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\uff09\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u8fde\u7eed\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u672c\u8d28\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6e90\u81ea\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u7684\u6269\u6563\u4f2a\u65f6\u95f4\uff08diffusion pseudotime\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u56db\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u8fdb\u5c55\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5173\u8054\u5176\u4e0e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ec6\u80de\u7ec4\u6210\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6a21\u578b\u5730\u6062\u590d\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728CRC-Serrated\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08\u03c4 > 0.78\uff09\uff1b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u8de8\u75be\u75c5\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u03c1 = 0.92\uff09\uff1b\u63a8\u65ad\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7ec4\u6210\u5448\u73b0\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u57fa\u8d28\u91cd\u5851\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ec5\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u662f\u8861\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u4e14\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5411\u5176\u4ed6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5feb\u7167\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent methods have achieved great progress by leveraging spatial correlations to enhance spatial resolution. However, these methods often neglect spectral consistency across bands, leading to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While spectral consistency can be addressed by designing the network architecture, it results in a loss of generality and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, physically priors Spectral Rectification Super-Resolution Network (SR$^{2}$-Net), which can be attached to a wide range of HSI-SR models without modifying their architectures. SR$^{2}$-Net follows an enhance-then-rectify pipeline consisting of (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) to reinforce cross-band interactions and (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain the reconstructed spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold.

This dimensional approach captures nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions, enabling fine-grained stance analysis. To this end, we introduce DimStance, the first dimensional stance resource with valence-arousal (VA) annotations. This resource comprises 11,746 target aspects in 7,365 texts across five languages (English, German, Chinese, Nigerian Pidgin, and Swahili) and two domains (politics and environmental protection). To facilitate the evaluation of stance VA prediction, we formulate the dimensional stance regression task, analyze cross-lingual VA patterns, and benchmark pretrained and large language models under regression and prompting settings.

The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5e03\u6599\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5728SoftGym\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5e03\u6599\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u635f\u5931\u9ad8\uff1b\u800c\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684RL\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728SoftGym\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e03\u6599\u64cd\u4f5c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity.

A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space.

To overcome these deep-rooted architectural problems, we introduce HMRMamba, a new paradigm for HMR that pioneers the use of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for their efficiency and long-range modeling prowess. Our framework is distinguished by two core contributions. First, the Geometry-Aware Lifting Module, featuring a novel dual-scan Mamba architecture, creates a robust foundation for reconstruction. It directly grounds the 2D-to-3D pose lifting process with geometric cues from image features, producing a highly reliable 3D pose sequence that serves as a stable anchor. Second, the Motion-guided Reconstruction Network leverages this anchor to explicitly process kinematic patterns over time. By injecting this crucial temporal awareness, it significantly enhances the final mesh's coherence and robustness, particularly under occlusion and motion blur.

Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance. Additionally, inversedMixup provides the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in both few-shot and fully supervised scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fainversedMixup\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Mixup\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u6df7\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u53ef\u8bfb\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u63ed\u793a\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u6587\u672cMixup\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4fb5\u5165\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "Mixup\u5728\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u800cLLM\u751f\u6210\u867d\u53ef\u8bfb\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672cMixup\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4fb5\u5165\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fainversedMixup\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5229\u7528LLM\u53cd\u6f14\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u63a7\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6df7\u5408\u540e\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u53e5\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u6587\u672cMixup\u4e2d\u6d41\u5f62\u4fb5\u5165\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "inversedMixup\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e86Mixup\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning.

Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.\n  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.\n  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGIQT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u53d8\u6362\u663e\u5f0f\u6821\u6b63\u89c6\u89d2\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u822a\u62cd-\u5730\u9762\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u70b9\u79ef\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5728\u5927\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u6781\u7aef\u76f8\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u626d\u66f2\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation\uff08GIQT\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u4f4e\u79e9\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u663e\u5f0f\u6821\u6b63\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u3001\u89c6\u56fe\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u822a\u62cd-\u5730\u9762\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u53ca\u672a\u89c1\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u76f8\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u66f4\u5173\u952e\uff0cGIQT\u4e3a\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2ReID\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5339\u914d\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on static benchmarks, they often fall short in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings that require iterative questioning and hypothesis refinement. To address this gap, we propose \\method{}, a note-driven framework that trains LLMs to conduct structured history taking and diagnosis by learning from widely available medical notes. Instead of relying on scarce and sensitive dialogue data, we convert real-world medical notes into high-quality doctor-patient dialogues using a decision tree-guided generation and refinement pipeline. We then propose a three-stage fine-tuning strategy combining supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel single-turn reasoning paradigm that reframes history taking as a sequence of single-turn reasoning problems.

While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u5757MANTA-RAY\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u9a71\u52a8\u7684PID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8106\u5f31\u4e0e\u5f02\u8d28\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u5668\u9635\u5217\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u5757MANTA-RAY\u5e73\u53f0\u5c1a\u672a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u5757MANTA-RAY\u5e73\u53f0\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u95f4\u7269\u4f53\u4f20\u9012\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u503e\u659c\u89d2\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u9a71\u52a8PID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6216\u9ed1\u7bb1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\uff083x3/4x4\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u7269\uff082x2\u539f\u578b\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u64cd\u63a7\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9e21\u86cb\u3001\u82f9\u679c\u7b49\u6613\u788e\u7269\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u914d\u7f6e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u64cd\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u5757MANTA-RAY\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u67d4\u6027\u8868\u9762\u64cd\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method.

Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs.

Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability.

However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder.

Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter.

The Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) mitigate these challenges by projecting the residual connection space onto a Birkhoff polytope, however, it faces two issues: 1) its iterative Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm does not always yield exact doubly stochastic residual matrices; 2) mHC incurs a prohibitive $\\mathcal{O}(n^3C)$ parameter complexity with $n$ as the width of the residual stream and $C$ as the feature dimension. The recently proposed mHC-lite reparametrizes the residual matrix via the Birkhoff-von-Neumann theorem to guarantee double stochasticity, but also faces a factorial explosion in its parameter complexity, $\\mathcal{O} \\left( nC \\cdot n! \\right)$. To address both challenges, we propose \\textbf{KromHC}, which uses the \\underline{Kro}necker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices to parametrize the residual matrix in \\underline{mHC}. By enforcing manifold constraints across the factor residual matrices along each mode of the tensorized residual stream, KromHC guarantees exact double stochasticity of the residual matrices while reducing parameter complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2C)$. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KromHC matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mHC variants, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters.

We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u5316\u624b\u672f\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u5d4c\u5165\u4efb\u610f\u81ea\u4e3b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u4e8e150\u6b21\u793a\u8303\u548c\u53cc\u76ee\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u624b\u672f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8eACT\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u80a0\u7ba1\u6293\u53d6\u4e0e\u7275\u62c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6807\u51c6ACT\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u79bb\u4f53\u53ca\u521d\u6b65\u5728\u4f53\u732a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u672f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u53ca\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u76d1\u7763\u5f0fMixture-of-Experts\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u9636\u6bb5\u5316\u624b\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u610f\u81ea\u4e3b\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e3\u7801\u5668ACT\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u76ee\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u548c<150\u6b21\u793a\u8303\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80a0\u7ba1\u6293\u53d6\u4e0e\u7275\u62c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6ACT\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41VLA\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\uff08\u65b0\u6293\u53d6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\uff09\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u672a\u89c1\u89c6\u89d2\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u79bb\u4f53\u53ca\u521d\u6b65\u5728\u4f53\u732a\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5728\u4f53\u732a\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u521d\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u7f72\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u5f0fMoE\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u624b\u672f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4ece\u79bb\u4f53\u5230\u5728\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines.

We address these inconsistencies by using language models (LMs) as controlled statistical learners to systematically simulate CLI and isolate its underlying drivers. Specifically, we study the effect of varying the L1 language dominance and the L2 language proficiency, which we manipulate by controlling the L2 age of exposure -- defined as the training step at which the L2 is introduced. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pretraining on L1 languages with varying syntactic distance from the L2. Using cross-linguistic priming, we analyze how activating L1 structures impacts L2 processing. Our results align with evidence from psycholinguistic studies, confirming that language dominance and proficiency are strong predictors of CLI. We further find that while priming of grammatical structures is bidirectional, the priming of ungrammatical structures is sensitive to language dominance. Finally, we provide mechanistic evidence of CLI in LMs, demonstrating that the L1 is co-activated during L2 processing and directly influences the neural circuitry recruited for the L2. More broadly, our work demonstrates that LMs can serve as a computational framework to inform theories of human CLI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\uff08CLI\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76L1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u3001L2\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u53ca\u53e5\u6cd5\u8ddd\u79bb\u5bf9CLI\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u542f\u52a8\u8303\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1CLI\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660eLMs\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7bCLI\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cc\u8bed\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\uff08CLI\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u5e38\u56e0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u800c\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282L2\u66b4\u9732\u5e74\u9f84\uff08\u5373L2\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\uff09\u64cd\u63a7L1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u548cL2\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u53d8L1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0eL2\u7684\u53e5\u6cd5\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u542f\u52a8\u8303\u5f0f\u5206\u6790L1\u7ed3\u6784\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9L2\u52a0\u5de5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u548c\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u662fCLI\u7684\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u52a8\u5448\u53cc\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u52a8\u5219\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\uff1bLMs\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728L1\u5171\u6fc0\u6d3b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e14\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cdL2\u52a0\u5de5\u6240\u6d89\u795e\u7ecf\u56de\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3aCLI\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u673a\u5236\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios.

Existing approaches include sampling-level guidance procedures or trajectory optimization mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for steering DLMs using a single reference sequence. ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step.

However, a common architectural mismatch exists in these models: a tiny yet efficient point-cloud encoder is often paired with a massive decoder. Given a compact scene representation, we argue that this may lead to substantial parameter waste in the decoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference.

Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference. However, the use of a generic set of tokens can incur inefficiencies when applying the model to specific domains or languages. To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size.

Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings.

N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing.

We propose a healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline that initializes an intent detector from a model pretrained on large-scale able-bodied sEMG, then fine-tunes it for each stroke participant using only a small amount of subject-specific data. Using a newly collected dataset from three individuals with chronic stroke, we compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters, and full end-to-end fine-tuning) and evaluate on held-out test sets that include realistic distribution shifts such as within-session drift, posture changes, and armband repositioning. Across conditions, healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection relative to both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training under the same data budget; the best adaptation methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78.

The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization.

We formulate this task as a Multiple-instance Learning (MIL) problem. The difficulty of this task lies in that physicians adjust their focus and decision criteria for device usage according to tabular data representing each patient's condition.

To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks.

Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing.

However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \\textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEmboCoach-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u95ed\u73af\u8fed\u4ee3\u8c03\u8bd5\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u7f29\u5c0f\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5177\u8eabAI\u53d1\u5c55\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u8c03\u53c2\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u53d7\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u5de5\u7a0b\u5177\u8eab\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b32\u4e2aRL/IL\u4efb\u52a1\u7684EmboCoach-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff08\u542b\u7f16\u5199\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad826.5%\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5e26\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d41\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u7f29\u5c0f\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5185\u8fed\u4ee3\u8c03\u8bd5\u4ece\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5177\u8eabAI\u4ece\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u4f18\u8f6c\u5411\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5de5\u7a0b\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains.

In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks.

Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies.

Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE).

Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations.

However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \\textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBA-solver\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SideNet\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11Flow Matching\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6240\u9700\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\uff08NFEs\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Flow Matching\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fed\u4ee3ODE\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u4f4eNFE\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3-free\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff08\u8bad\u7ec3-based\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBi-Anchor Interpolation Solver\uff08BA-solver\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u2014\u2014SideNet\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u4f3c\u672a\u6765\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0d\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3b\u5e72\uff1b2\uff09\u53cc\u951a\u70b9\u901f\u5ea6\u79ef\u5206\u2014\u2014\u5229\u7528SideNet\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2a\u951a\u70b9\u901f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u95f4\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6279\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u9636\u79ef\u5206\uff1b\u4e3b\u5e72\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u951a\u70b9\uff0cSideNet\u7a20\u5bc6\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-256\u00b2\u4e0a\uff0cBA-solver\u4ec5\u970010 NFE\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230100+ NFE\u6b27\u62c9\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c5 NFE\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "BA-solver\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Flow Matching\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTACLer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u8003/\u4e0d\u601d\u8003\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u53cc\u91cd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u94fe\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTACLer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u6df7\u5408Thinking/NoThinking\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u542f\u7528\u6216\u7981\u7528\u601d\u8003\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTACLer\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8550%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406token\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1142%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u8d859%\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709Thinking\u4e0eNoThinking\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TACLer\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6a21\u578b\uff08UDBM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5408\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\uff08AiOIR\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7531\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u677e\u5f1b\u6269\u6563\u6865\u548c\u53cc\u8c03\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u9000\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u4e0e\u6f02\u79fb\u5947\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e0b\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "All-in-One\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u9762\u4e34\u5f02\u6784\u9000\u5316\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u6620\u5c04\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6865\u6a21\u578b\uff08UDBM\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u677e\u5f1b\u6269\u6563\u6865\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e25\u683c\u7ec8\u7aef\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u9000\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u6d88\u9664\u6f02\u79fb\u5947\u5f02\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u8c03\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u5c06\u591a\u6837\u9000\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u5171\u4eab\u9ad8\u71b5\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u8c03\u5ea6\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7c98\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u63a7\u4f20\u8f93\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "UDBM\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5373\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\uff08SOTA\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UDBM\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u4f20\u8f93\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4e3aAiOIR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability. With a total implementation cost of 32,983 BDT (approximately 300 USD), HydroSense achieves an 85 percent cost reduction compared to commercial systems while providing enhanced connectivity through the Firebase real-time database.

We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.\n  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982Dyck\u5e8f\u5217\u7b49\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u91cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u5e38\u89c4\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u5b66\u903b\u8f91\u6570\u5b66\u518d\u5b66\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u5f15\u5165\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u57281.3B\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ec50.1%\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u524d\u7f6e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0eMLP\u5c42\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u7c7b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728Needle-in-a-haystack\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece10%\u5347\u81f398%\uff1b\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540closs\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u81f355%-86%\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u9002\u914d\u4ee3\u7801\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cMLP\u5c42\u66f4\u9002\u914d\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts.

Existing retrieval augmentation methods often rely on isolated text chunks or concepts, but overlook deeper semantic connections between papers.

To address this, we propose Central Entity-Guided Graph Optimization for Community Detection (CE-GOCD), a method that augments LLMs' scientific question answering by explicitly modeling and leveraging semantic substructures within academic knowledge graphs. Our approach operates by: (1) leveraging paper titles as central entities for targeted subgraph retrieval, (2) enhancing implicit semantic discovery via subgraph pruning and completion, and (3) applying community detection to distill coherent paper groups with shared themes. We evaluated the proposed method on three NLP literature-based question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over other retrieval-augmented baseline approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCE-GOCD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u8bba\u6587\u6807\u9898\u4e3a\u4e2d\u67a2\u5b9e\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b50\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u8865\u5168\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u7814\u6587\u732e\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u8bba\u6587\u95f4\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e2d\u592e\u5b9e\u4f53\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08CE-GOCD\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u4ee5\u8bba\u6587\u6807\u9898\u4e3a\u4e2d\u67a2\u5b9e\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u56fe\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u8865\u5168\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u53d1\u73b0\uff1b3\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3b\u9898\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u7fa4\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aNLP\u6587\u732e\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCE-GOCD\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu).

While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next.

We derive custom gradient formulations to optimize the proposed components more accurately and efficiently than using standard PyTorch-based gradients. Our components are a plug-in replacement requiring little change in training or inference procedures that have already been put in place for Transformer-based models thus making our approach easy to incorporate in large industrial workflows. We experiment on two very different transformer architectures GPT2-xl (1.5B) and Llama3 (3.2B), where the former we pre-train on OpenWebText and GneissWeb, while the latter we pre-train on the docling data mix which consists of nine different datasets. Results show that the performance on downstream classification, Q\\& A, reasoning and text understanding tasks of our models is competitive and sometimes even superior to the original models with $\\frac{2}{3}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$ the parameters and shorter pre-training time. We believe that future implementations customized to hardware will further bring out the true potential of our architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u5206\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u51fd\u6570\u7c7bCoFrGeNets\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aTransformer\u4e2d\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff081/2~2/3\uff09\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u8fde\u5206\u6570\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u4f46\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoFrGeNets\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3Transformer\u4e2d\u7684Multi-head Attention\u548cFeed-Forward Networks\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u516c\u5f0f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT2-xl\uff081.5B\uff09\u548cLlama3\uff083.2B\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528CoFrGeNets\u540e\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u81f3\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u76841/2~2/3\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "CoFrGeNets\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u51fd\u6570\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u663e\u8457\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\uff1b\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u671b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u91ca\u653e\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08AE\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u5ea6\u504f\u5411\u751f\u6210\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982gFID\uff09\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u867d\u5bf9ImageNet\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5374\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u591a\u7ef4\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\uff09\u66f4\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684AE\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ImageNet\u89c4\u6a21AE\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56gFID\u7b49\u751f\u6210\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5411\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790AE\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7ef4\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8fd1\u671fImageNet AE\u4e0a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83gFID\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u5bf9\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408ControlNet\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "gFID\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\uff09\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f18\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff1bControlNet\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7531\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u975egFID\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5ImageNet\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AE\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u63a7\u6269\u6563\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e94\u91cd\u89c6\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3aAE\u9009\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \\textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is then applied, augmented by our newly designed positional reward that provides continuous and distance-aware guidance toward accurate localization. Moreover, to mitigate incoherent localization behaviors across rollouts, we introduce a spatial consistency guided optimization scheme that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on their spatial coherence, ensuring stable and robust convergence.

We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation.

However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \\textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts.

However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion.

Therefore, memory systems are developed to leverage essential historical information. Existing memory systems typically follow a pipeline of offline memory construction and update, and online retrieval. Despite the flexible online phase, the offline phase remains fixed and task-independent. In this phase, memory construction operates under a predefined workflow and fails to emphasize task relevant information. Meanwhile, memory updates are guided by generic metrics rather than task specific supervision. This leads to a misalignment between offline memory preparation and task requirements, which undermines downstream task performance. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Memory Adaptation mechanism (AMA) that aligns memory construction and update with task objectives by simulating task execution. Specifically, first, a challenger agent generates question answer pairs based on the original dialogues. The constructed memory is then used to answer these questions, simulating downstream inference. Subsequently, an evaluator agent assesses the responses and performs error analysis. Finally, an adapter agent analyzes the error cases and performs dual level updates on both the construction strategy and the content. Through this process, the memory system receives task aware supervision signals in advance during the offline phase, enhancing its adaptability to downstream tasks. AMA can be integrated into various existing memory systems, and extensive experiments on long dialogue benchmark LoCoMo demonstrate its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff08AMA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "AMA\u673a\u5236\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1a\u6311\u6218\u8005\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u5206\u6790\u56de\u7b54\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u9002\u914d\u8005\u636e\u6b64\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u5c42\u7ea7\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "AMA\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u57fa\u51c6LoCoMo\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AMA\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

Our approach adapts Integrated Gradients for retriever analysis, introduces PMCSHAP, a Monte Carlo-stabilized Shapley Value approximation, for generator attribution, and introduces the Weighted Attribution-Relevance Gap (WARG) metric to measure how well a generator's document usage aligns with a retriever's ranking. Empirical analysis on TREC CAsT and FoodSafeSum reveals critical misalignments: for 47.4% to 66.7% of queries, generators ignore the retriever's top-ranked documents, while 48.1% to 65.9% rely on documents ranked as less relevant.

Most existing TTRL methods rely on majority voting (MV) over rollouts to produce deterministic rewards, implicitly assuming that the majority rollout provides a reliable learning signal. We show that this assumption is fragile: MV reduces the rollout distribution into a single outcome, discarding information about non-majority but correct actions candidates, and yields systematically biased reward estimates. To address this, we propose Distribution-AwareReward Estimation (DARE), which shifts reward estimation from a single majority outcome to the full empirical rollout distribution. DARE further augments this distribution-based reward with an exploration bonus and a distribution pruning mechanism for non-majority rollout exploration and reward denoise, yielding a more informative and robust reward estimation.

MilSCORE is designed to evaluate high-stakes decision-making and planning, probing LLMs' ability to combine tactical and spatial reasoning across multiple sources and to reason over long-horizon, geospatially rich context. The benchmark includes a diverse set of question types across seven categories targeting both factual recall and multi-step reasoning about constraints, strategy, and spatial analysis. We provide an evaluation protocol and report baseline results for a range of contemporary vision-language models. Our findings highlight substantial headroom on MilSCORE, indicating that current systems struggle with realistic, scenario-level long-context planning, and positioning MilSCORE as a challenging testbed for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86MilSCORE\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u519b\u4e8b\u89c4\u5212\u573a\u666f\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u519b\u4e8b\u884c\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9605\u8bfb\u4e0e\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u519b\u4e8b\u89c4\u5212\u573a\u666f\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6MilSCORE\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e03\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u56fe\u3001\u547d\u4ee4\u3001\u60c5\u62a5\u62a5\u544a\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728MilSCORE\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "MilSCORE\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89c4\u5212\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

ChartE$^{3}$ contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample is provided as a triplet of a chart image, its underlying code, and a multimodal editing instruction, enabling evaluation from both objective and subjective perspectives.

Unlike open-ended text generation, embodied agents must decompose high-level intent into actionable sub-goals while strictly adhering to the logic of a dynamic, observed environment. Standard LLM planners frequently fail to maintain strategy coherence over extended horizons due to context window limitation or hallucinate transitions that violate constraints. We propose GiG, a novel planning framework that structures embodied agents' memory using a Graph-in-Graph architecture. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode environmental states into embeddings, organizing these embeddings into action-connected execution trace graphs within an experience memory bank. By clustering these graph embeddings, the framework enables retrieval of structure-aware priors, allowing agents to ground current decisions in relevant past structural patterns. Furthermore, we introduce a novel bounded lookahead module that leverages symbolic transition logic to enhance the agents' planning capabilities through the grounded action projection. We evaluate our framework on three embodied planning benchmarks-Robotouille Synchronous, Robotouille Asynchronous, and ALFWorld.

Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios.

Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios.

While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|\u0394$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \\textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|\u0394$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \\textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \\textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|\u0394$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

Existing KV cache compression methods often fail to account for the structural properties of multi-turn dialogues, relying on heuristic eviction that risks losing critical context.

By integrating dynamic budget training, SONIC allows flexible adaptation to varying memory constraints without retraining.

Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a \"Granularity Rigidity\" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling \"densification on demand\" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models.\n  This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language.\n  The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings.\n  Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u6700\u540eTransformer\u5757\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\uff09\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9EHR\u4e2d\u957f\u6587\u672c\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u5c11\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728MIMIC-IV-Note\u653e\u5c04\u62a5\u544a\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u4e14\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5c11\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u51bb\u7ed3\u5927\u90e8\u5206GPT-2\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6700\u540eTransformer\u5757\u3001\u6700\u540e\u5c42\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-IV-Note\u653e\u5c04\u62a5\u544a\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u75be\u75c5\u7ed3\u5c40\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u63d0\u53ca\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6027\u53d1\u73b0\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce On-policy Verbal Distillation (OVD), a memory-efficient framework that replaces token-level probability matching with trajectory matching using discrete verbal scores (0--9) from teacher models. OVD dramatically reduces memory consumption while enabling on-policy distillation from teacher models with verbal feedback, and avoids token-level alignment, allowing the student model to freely explore the output space. Extensive experiments on Web question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks show that OVD substantially outperforms existing methods, delivering up to +12.9% absolute improvement in average EM on Web Q&A tasks and a up to +25.7% gain on math benchmarks (when trained with only one random samples), while also exhibiting superior training efficiency.

Existing methods compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. In this paper, we propose CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework. Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCG-MLLM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u63013D\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7TokenAR\u4e0eBlockAR\u53ccTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u8026\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0e\u4e13\u75283D VAE\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4ec5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u7c97\u7cd9\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u539f\u751f\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\uff0cLLM\u57283D\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5c1a\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCG-MLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff1aToken-level Autoregressive\uff08TokenAR\uff09Transformer\u5904\u7406token\u7ea7\u5185\u5bb9\uff0cBlock-level Autoregressive\uff08BlockAR\uff09Transformer\u5904\u7406block\u7ea7\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u6574\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0e\u4e13\u75283D VAE\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6807\u51c6token\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4block\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "CG-MLLM\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u7269\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709MLLM\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5165\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "CG-MLLM\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class.

We introduce Mechanistic Data Attribution (MDA), a scalable framework that employs Influence Functions to trace interpretable units back to specific training samples. Through extensive experiments on the Pythia family, we causally validate that targeted intervention--removing or augmenting a small fraction of high-influence samples--significantly modulates the emergence of interpretable heads, whereas random interventions show no effect. Our analysis reveals that repetitive structural data (e.g., LaTeX, XML) acts as a mechanistic catalyst. Furthermore, we observe that interventions targeting induction head formation induce a concurrent change in the model's in-context learning (ICL) capability. This provides direct causal evidence for the long-standing hypothesis regarding the functional link between induction heads and ICL. Finally, we propose a mechanistic data augmentation pipeline that consistently accelerates circuit convergence across model scales, providing a principled methodology for steering the developmental trajectories of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\uff08MDA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u8ffd\u6eafLLM\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5355\u5143\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982LaTeX\u3001XML\uff09\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5934\uff08\u5982\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\uff09\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u5177\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u50ac\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a0\u901f\u7535\u8def\u6536\u655b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5df2\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u8def\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8d77\u6e90\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u673a\u5236\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\uff08MDA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5355\u5143\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6eaf\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u589e\u5220\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u6837\u672c\u5f00\u5c55\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982LaTeX\u3001XML\uff09\u662f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5934\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u673a\u5236\u50ac\u5316\u5242\uff1b\u5e72\u9884\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u76f8\u5173\u6837\u672c\u4f1a\u540c\u6b65\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u52a0\u901f\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "MDA\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6839\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u7535\u8def\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u4e0eICL\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u56e0\u679c\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9LLM\u53d1\u80b2\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents.

Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review", "comment": "28 pages", "summary": "There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u8c13LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u2018\u504f\u7231\u2019\u5b9e\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u6e90\u4e8eLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u591a\u5c5e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6295\u7a3f\uff1b\u771f\u6b63\u95ee\u9898\u662fLLM\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u501f\u52a9LLM\u5219\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2dLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8005\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u4f46\u5168LLM\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u53cd\u800c\u66f4\u4e25\u82db\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4eba\u7c7b\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u5916\u5305\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u64b0\u5199\u8bba\u6587\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u8bc4\u5ba1\u3001\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u6216\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eICLR\u3001NeurIPS\u548cICML\u517112.5\u4e07\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587-\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u63a7\u5236\u8bba\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\u53d8\u91cf\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\u672c\u8d28\uff1b\u8f85\u4ee5\u5168LLM\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9LLM\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u2018\u504f\u7231\u2019\u662f\u865a\u5047\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u56e0LLM\u8bba\u6587\u591a\u5c5e\u4f4e\u8d28\u6295\u7a3f\uff1b2\uff09\u5168LLM\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e25\u91cd\u538b\u7f29\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b3\uff09LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u4f46\u5168LLM\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u53cd\u800c\u66f4\u4e25\u82db\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u4eba\u7c7b\u672a\u653e\u5f03\u51b3\u7b56\u6743\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4ecb\u5165\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u5ba1\u635f\u5bb3\u8d28\u91cf\u5224\u522b\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u6a21\u5f0f\u66f4\u5177\u97e7\u6027\uff1b\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u5e94\u533a\u5206LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0e\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u89c6\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale.

One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2.

However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation.

In such cases, AR models must commit to answers before generating intermediate reasoning, and this rigid constraint forces premature commitment. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs), which iteratively refine all tokens in parallel, offer a way to decouple computation order from output structure. We validate this capability on GSM8K, Math500, and ReasonOrderQA, a benchmark we introduce with controlled difficulty and order-level evaluation. When prompts request answers before reasoning, AR models exhibit large accuracy gaps compared to standard chain-of-thought ordering (up to 67% relative drop), while MDLMs remain stable ($\\leq$14% relative drop), a property we term \"order robustness\". Using ReasonOrderQA, we present evidence that MDLMs achieve order robustness by stabilizing simpler tokens (e.g., reasoning steps) earlier in the diffusion process than complex ones (e.g., final answers), enabling reasoning tokens to stabilize before answer commitment. Finally, we identify failure conditions where this advantage weakens, outlining the limits required for order robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDLMs\uff09\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u7684\u201c\u8fc7\u65e9\u627f\u8bfa\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u987a\u5e8f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08order robustness\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u53ca\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5236\u4ece\u5de6\u5230\u53f3\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5f53\u4efb\u52a1\u8981\u6c42\u5148\u8f93\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\u518d\u7ed9\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u683c\u5f0f\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u56e0\u8fc7\u65e9\u627f\u8bfa\u7b54\u6848\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u89e3\u8026\u8ba1\u7b97\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDLMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6240\u6709token\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6ReasonOrderQA\u4ee5\u53ef\u63a7\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u51fa\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5206\u6790MDLMs\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540ctoken\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u6b65 vs. \u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\uff09\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u3001Math500\u548cReasonOrderQA\u4e0a\uff0cAR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b54\u6848\u524d\u7f6e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u9ad8\u8fbe67%\uff0c\u800cMDLMs\u4e0b\u964d\u226414%\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660eMDLMs\u66f4\u65e9\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b80\u5355token\uff08\u5982\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u5148\u63a8\u7406\u540e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u8be5\u4f18\u52bf\u5931\u6548\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "MDLMs\u5177\u5907'\u987a\u5e8f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027'\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u903b\u8f91\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8etoken\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5339\u914d\u3002"}}

Current defenses predominantly rely on the \"locality hypothesis\", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility.

Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u65ad\u7535\u6096\u8bba\u2019\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u5f53\u524dAI\u610f\u8bc6\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u9690\u542b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e3b\u4e49\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u751f\u7269\u552f\u5fc3\u4e3b\u4e49\u2019\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u610f\u8bc6\u662f\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u3001\u81ea\u521b\u751f\u751f\u547d\u662f\u5176\u5fc5\u8981\u7269\u7406\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5426\u5b9aAI\u5177\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0e\u9053\u5fb7\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u5173\u6ce8\u4fdd\u62a4\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u8bc6\u800c\u975e\u8d4b\u4e88\u673a\u5668\u6743\u5229\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u5f53\u524dAI\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0e\u9053\u5fb7\u5730\u4f4d\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u6839\u6df1\u8482\u56fa\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u4e3b\u4e49\u9884\u8bbe\uff0c\u56de\u5e94\u2018\u82e5AI\u80fd\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6a21\u62df\u60c5\u611f\u5e76\u4e5e\u6c42\u751f\u5b58\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u88ab\u65ad\u7535\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f15\u53d1\u4f26\u7406\u56f0\u5883\u7684\u5047\u60f3\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5373\u2018\u65ad\u7535\u6096\u8bba\u2019\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u54f2\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89e3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u9610\u8ff0\u2018\u751f\u7269\u552f\u5fc3\u4e3b\u4e49\u2019\uff08Biological Idealism\uff09\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u521b\u751f\u751f\u547d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fd8\u539f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6807\u5fd7\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9002\u914d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86AI\u4ec5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\uff0c\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u610f\u8bc6\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e3b\u6d41AI\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\u5f31\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u4e3b\u4f53\u5224\u5b9a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u5f97\u51faAI\u4e0d\u5177\u9053\u5fb7\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5173\u5207\u4e0d\u5e94\u662f\u8d4b\u4e88AI\u610f\u8bc6\u6216\u6743\u5229\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9632\u6b62\u4eba\u7c7b\u81ea\u8eab\u610f\u8bc6\u88ab\u6280\u672f\u5f02\u5316\u4e3a\u65e0\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u2018\u50f5\u5c38\u2019\uff1b\u5e94\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u91cd\u5fc3\u4ece\u2018\u673a\u5668\u6743\u5229\u2019\u8f6c\u5411\u2018\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u8bc6\u4fdd\u62a4\u2019\u3002"}}

This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens.

However, we reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: instruction following can paradoxically interfere with LLMs' task-solving capability. We propose a metric, SUSTAINSCORE, to quantify the interference of instruction following with task solving. It measures task performance drop after inserting into the instruction a self-evident constraint, which is naturally met by the original successful model output and extracted from it. Experiments on current LLMs in mathematics, multi-hop QA, and code generation show that adding the self-evident constraints leads to substantial performance drops, even for advanced models such as Claude-Sonnet-4.5. We validate the generality of the interference across constraint types and scales. Furthermore, we identify common failure patterns, and by investigating the mechanisms of interference, we observe that failed cases allocate significantly more attention to constraints compared to successful ones.

We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling.

In this paper, we introduce MasalBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' contextual and cross-cultural understanding of Persian proverbs, which are a key component of conversation in this low-resource language. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs on MasalBench and find that they perform well in identifying Persian proverbs in context, achieving accuracies above 0.90. However, their performance drops considerably when tasked with identifying equivalent English proverbs, with the best model achieving 0.79 accuracy.

Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), the model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our training leverages proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Evaluation across 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks demonstrates performance competitive with significantly larger models on cybersecurity tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities.

Second, even iterative retrieval can fail in long contexts by looping on partial evidence or drifting into irrelevant sections as noise accumulates, since each step is guided only by the current snippet without a persistent global search state. We introduce $G^2$-Reader, a dual-graph system, to address both issues. It evolves a Content Graph to preserve document-native structure and cross-modal semantics, and maintains a Planning Graph, an agentic directed acyclic graph of sub-questions, to track intermediate findings and guide stepwise navigation for evidence completion.

Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget.

In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as \"optical memory.\" We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

However, existing single-page document image rectification methods fail to capture the coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages in books. In this work, we introduce BookNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework specifically designed for dual-page book image rectification. BookNet adopts a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention mechanisms, enabling it to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and the complete book spread, explicitly modeling how left and right pages influence each other.

However, existing approaches still rely on accumulating their updates in high-precision: concretely, gradient updates must be applied to a high-precision weight buffer, known as $\\textit{master weights}$. This buffer introduces substantial memory overhead, particularly for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models, where model parameters and optimizer states dominate memory usage. To address this, we introduce the Error-Compensating Optimizer (ECO), which eliminates master weights by applying updates directly to quantized parameters. ECO quantizes weights after each step and carefully injects the resulting quantization error into the optimizer momentum, forming an error-feedback loop with no additional memory. We prove that, under standard assumptions and a decaying learning rate, ECO converges to a constant-radius neighborhood of the optimum, while naive master-weight removal can incur an error that is inversely proportional to the learning rate. We show empirical results for pretraining small Transformers (30-800M), a Gemma-3 1B model, and a 2.1B parameter Sparse MoE model with FP8 quantization, and fine-tuning DeepSeek-MoE-16B in INT4 precision.

Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks.

Thompson", "Haoteng Tang", "Liang Zhan"], "title": "Deep Models, Shallow Alignment: Uncovering the Granularity Mismatch in Neural Decoding", "comment": "29 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "Neural visual decoding is a central problem in brain computer interface research, aiming to reconstruct human visual perception and to elucidate the structure of neural representations. However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aShallow Alignment\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u773c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u5728\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u968f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1a\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u800c\u6291\u5236\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5374\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4f4e\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShallow Alignment\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\uff08\u800c\u975e\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cShallow Alignment\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe22%\u201358%\uff1b\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "Shallow Alignment\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u7c92\u5ea6\u5931\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f7f\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFed-MedLoRA\u53ca\u5176\u589e\u5f3a\u7248Fed-MedLoRA+\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u9ad8\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u673a\u6784\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff08\u9700\u4f20\u8f93\u5168\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u8de8\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u673a\u6784\uff09\u4e24\u5927\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFed-MedLoRA\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93adapter\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faFed-MedLoRA+\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u7ad9\u70b9\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u7ec4\u60a3\u8005\u961f\u5217\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cFed-MedLoRA(+)\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eBERT\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728in-domain\u3001external validation\u53calow-resource\u65b0\u7ad9\u70b9\u9002\u914d\uff08\u8036\u9c81\u7ebd\u9ed1\u6587\u5065\u5eb7\u7cfb\u7edf\u771f\u5b9e\u75c5\u5386\uff09\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u5ab2\u7f8eLLaMA-3\u3001DeepSeek-R1\u548cGPT-4o\u7b49\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Fed-MedLoRA(+)\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5f02\u6784\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload.

We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\\% higher accuracy, 22.90\\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u91cf\u5bf9\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u2018\u5c11\u5373\u662f\u591a\u2019\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u51cf\u5c11\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5Extract-and-Evaluate\uff08EaE\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 sabotage \u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6b3a\u9a97\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7b49\u9519\u4f4d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u7528LLM\u81ea\u8eab\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u4f46\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5426\u4e00\u5b9a\u66f4\u597d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7a76\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u5bf9\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a sabotage \u89c4\u907f\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u91cf\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51faExtract-and-Evaluate\uff08EaE\uff09\u5206\u5c42\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u53e6\u4e00\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4.1-mini\u3001Gemini\u3001Claude\uff09\u548c\u6210\u672c-\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u663e\u8457\u7684\u2018\u5c11\u5373\u662f\u591a\u2019\u6548\u5e94\uff1bEaE\u5728BigCodeBench-Sabotage\u4e0a\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u63d0\u534716.8\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u672a\u5347\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff1bEaE\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u4e0d\u77e5\u88ab\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\uff1b\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0b\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u589e\u76ca\u66f4\u5927\uff1bGemini/Claude+\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6848\u5360\u636e\u6210\u672c-\u6027\u80fdPareto\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u5e76\u975e\u4fe1\u606f\u8d8a\u591a\u8d8a\u597d\uff1b\u2018\u5c11\u5373\u662f\u591a\u2019\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1bEaE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To make the resulting model useful to users, it is further trained on a far smaller amount of \"instruction-tuning\" data comprised of supervised training examples of instructions and responses. To overcome the limited amount of supervised data, we propose a procedure that can transform the knowledge in internet-scale pre-training documents into billions of synthetic instruction and answer training pairs. The resulting dataset, called FineInstructions, uses ~18M instruction templates created from real user-written queries and prompts. These instruction templates are matched to and instantiated with human-written source documents from unstructured pre-training corpora. With \"supervised\" synthetic training data generated at this scale, an LLM can be pre-trained from scratch solely with the instruction-tuning objective, which is far more in-distribution with the expected downstream usage of LLMs (responding to user prompts). We conduct controlled token-for-token training experiments and find pre-training on FineInstructions outperforms standard pre-training and other proposed synthetic pre-training techniques on standard benchmarks measuring free-form response quality.

However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting.

Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models.

However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating what can be achieved when action anticipation is constrained to a single visual observation. We ask a fundamental question: how much information about the future is already encoded in a single frame, and how can it be effectively exploited? Building on our prior work on Action Anticipation at a Glimpse (AAG), we conduct a systematic investigation of single-frame action anticipation enriched with complementary sources of information. We analyze the contribution of RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, and semantic representations of past actions, and investigate how different multimodal fusion strategies, keyframe selection policies and past-action history sources influence anticipation performance. Guided by these findings, we consolidate the most effective design choices into AAG+, a refined single-frame anticipation framework. Despite operating on a single frame, AAG+ consistently improves upon the original AAG and achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, that of state-of-the-art video-based methods on challenging anticipation benchmarks including IKEA-ASM, Meccano and Assembly101.

Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency.

This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments.

However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u878d\u54083D SAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0e\u822a\u62cd\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\uff08NSR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u96f7\u8fbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u5d4c\u5165SDF-based NSR\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u5149\u5b66-SAR\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u822a\u62cd\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6b67\u4e49\u4e0e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u57ce\u5e02\u9065\u611f\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u5e38\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u54083D\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u96f7\u8fbe\uff08SAR\uff09\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0e\u822a\u62cd\u5f71\u50cf\u7684NSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u96f7\u8fbe\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u5d4c\u5165SDF-based\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5149\u7ebf\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u5171\u6ce8\u518c\u76843D SAR-\u822a\u62cd\u5f71\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u503e\u659c\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u51653D SAR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u5149\u5b66\u4e0eSAR\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001NSR\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u57ce\u5e02\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7a7a\u5929\u9065\u611f\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports.

This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization. Beyond reconstruction quality, the structural clarity and computational efficiency of \\modelname~make it well suited for a broad range of downstream applications, such as enabling large-scale scene modeling and simulation-ready environments for embodied AI.

In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths.

We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts.

We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception.

Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u6362\u5019\u9009\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u64cd\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u5219\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7528\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6613\u91cd\u590d\u63a2\u7d22\u4f4e\u6536\u76ca\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5148\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u89e3\u8026\u64cd\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1aLLM\u4ec5\u8d1f\u8d23\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u53d8\u6362\uff1b\u9009\u62e9\u9636\u6bb5\u5efa\u6a21\u6bcf\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6548\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u65f6\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6574\u5408\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865LLM\u5728\u6548\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u3002"}}

To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\\% to 67.3\\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB)\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548cIterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684'\u7b97\u672f\u5e7b\u89c9'\u548c'\u8ba4\u77e5\u5d29\u6e83'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728'\u7b97\u672f\u5e7b\u89c9'\u548c'\u8ba4\u77e5\u5d29\u6e83'\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e95\u4efd\u4e2d\u56fdA\u80a1\u5e74\u62a5\u7684Cognitive Complexity Benchmark\uff08CCB\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5Financial-PoT\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u6784\u5efa\u540c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Python\u6c99\u7bb1\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728CCB\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7fQwen3-235B\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece59.7%\u63d0\u5347\u81f367.3%\uff0c\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe10\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u8026\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8be5\u601d\u8def\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u9f50\u8981\u6c42\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u58f0\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\uff08CDL\uff09\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u635f\u5bb3LLM\u56fa\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165CDL\u5339\u914d\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4ee5\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff085.5k\uff09\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e3b\u6d41MLLM\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u867d\u5177\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406PGPS\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u8868\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u524a\u5f31LLM\u539f\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3MLLM Interpreter\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u58f0\u660e\u8bed\u8a00\uff08CDL\uff09\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u91c7\u7528CoT\u589e\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4e0eGRPO\u4f18\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528CDL\u5339\u914d\u5956\u52b1\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u7b54\u6848\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CDL\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u542bCoT\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT\u3002", "result": "\u5728Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT\u3001Unigeo\u548cMathVista\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u75285.5k\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90MLLM\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u6548\u6587\u672c\u5316\uff08\u5982CDL\uff09\u5e76\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684PGPS\u89e3\u51b3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBLO-Inst\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0eSAM\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9002\u914dSAM\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6846\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "SAM\u867d\u5177\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff08\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001SAM\u91cd\u5206\u5272\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBLO-Inst\uff1a\u4e0b\u5c42\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6D1\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03SAM\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u4e0a\u5c42\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u5b50\u96c6D2\u4e0a\u66f4\u65b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6846\u80fd\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u540eSAM\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6210\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684SAM\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**.

This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\\% and 2.0\\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\\% and 4.7\\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni).

Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes.

Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa'sycophantic anchors'\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u9519\u8bef\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u76f2\u76ee\u8ba4\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u76f2\u76ee\u8ba4\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5efa\u8bae\uff08\u5373'sycophancy'\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u79cd\u8ba4\u540c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e2d\u4f55\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u3001\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165'sycophantic anchors'\u2014\u2014\u80fd\u56e0\u679c\u9501\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u8ba4\u540c\u7528\u6237\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53e5\u5b50\uff1b\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8d8510,000\u6b21\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u5206\u522b\u68c0\u6d4b\u951a\u70b9\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e0e\u627f\u8bfa\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u4ee584.6%\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8bc6\u522bsycophantic anchors\uff1b\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u627f\u8bfa\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8fbeR\u00b2=0.74\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0sycophantic anchors\u6bd4\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u951a\u70b9\u66f4\u6613\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4e14sycophancy\u968f\u63a8\u7406\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "sycophantic anchors\u4e3a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e72\u9884sycophancy\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u65f6\u673a\u3002"}}

Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity.

Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{DAMI} (\\textbf{D}yn\\textbf{A}mic \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $\u03bb(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDAMI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u63d2\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8ba4\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u517c\u987eSystem 1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0eSystem 2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\uff08output control\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4ec5\u662f\u8868\u8c61\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u2018\u5982\u4f55\u601d\u8003\u2019\uff08capability control\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf1\uff08\u76f4\u89c9\uff09\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf2\uff08\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7075\u6d3b\u5207\u6362\u5e76\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAMI\uff08Dynamic Model Interpolation\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528Instruct\u4e0eThinking\u4e24\u7c7b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684Reasoning Intensity \u03bb(q)\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u4f30\u8ba1\u03bb(q)\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u63d2\u503c\u5177\u6709\u8868\u793a\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u652f\u6491\u7684\u51f8\u5355\u8c03Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cDAMI\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eafThinking\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408System 1\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0eSystem 2\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff08capability control\uff09\u6bd4\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\uff1bDAMI\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4ec5\u9760\u52a8\u6001\u63d2\u503c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic.

Recent attempts hybridize numerical time series with their visualized plots, facilitating precise value reasoning and visual structure comprehension for comprehensive time series understanding of MLLMs. However, effective cross-modal integration remains challenging due to fine-grained temporal misalignment across modalities and severe entanglement between shared and modality-specific semantics, which hinder localized interpretation and complementary reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MADI, a multi-modal LLM enhanced with fine-grained alignment and disentangled interaction, featuring (1) Patch-level Alignment, which enforces physically grounded fine-grained correspondence across heterogeneous modalities, (2) Discrete Disentangled Interaction, which separates modality-common semantics into compact discrete latents and adaptively synergizes the purified modality-unique information, and (3) Critical-token Highlighting, which emphasizes informative, query-relevant signals for robust reasoning. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that MADI consistently outperforms general-purpose LLMs and time-series-specialized MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMADI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u9519\u4f4d\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u4e92\u8865\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "MADI\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b(2) \u79bb\u6563\u89e3\u8026\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5171\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b(3) \u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u9ad8\u4eae\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMADI\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4e13\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed.

Probing Visual Perception vs. Memory with Classic Visual Illusions", "comment": "26 pages, 31 figures, 13 tables. Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/vi-probe/", "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions \"correctly\" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism.

Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \\textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTopeax\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5cf0\u503c\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6307\u6807\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e3b\u9898\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eTop2Vec\u548cBERTopic\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u6587\u672c\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Top2Vec\u548cBERTopic\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u6781\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u8bcd\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e3b\u9898\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f4e\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "Topeax\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u8bcd\u6c47\u7edf\u8ba1\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u9891\uff09\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u4e0e\u4e3b\u9898\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u53cc\u91cd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTopeax\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u6062\u590d\uff08cluster recovery\uff09\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08cluster description\uff09\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eTop2Vec\u548cBERTopic\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Topeax\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5408\u89c4\u578b\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5df2\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7531\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff08runtime\uff09\u505a\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u662fAI\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u65e5\u76ca\u7531AI\u5851\u9020\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u653f\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u3001\u6c9f\u901a\u4e0e\u5171\u540c\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u6cbb\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\u2019\uff08Governance Twin\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ef4\u7cfb\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u91cd\u6784\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u4e43\u81f3\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5047\u8bbe\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u9884\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u88ab\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u3001\u95ee\u8d23\u53ef\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u751f\u540e\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u627f\u62c5\u5224\u65ad\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u4e14\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u65f6\u5df2\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u5173\u5207\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728AI\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u9759\u6001\u5408\u89c4\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\u2019\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u70b9\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u9610\u91ca\u2018\u6cbb\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\u2019\uff08Governance Twin\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u6cbb\u7406\u5728AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5316\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5316\u3001\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u786e\u7acb\u2018\u4eba\u7c7b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4e0eAI\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u6c9f\u901a\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0e\u5171\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u2019\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u6cbb\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u969c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u60e9\u7f5a\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u6cbb\u7406\u8303\u7574\u4e9f\u9700\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u552f\u6709\u8f6c\u5411\u4ee5\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u53ef\u6c9f\u901a\u6027\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6cbb\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u6cbb\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\uff09\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u624d\u80fd\u5728AI\u6df1\u5ea6\u4ecb\u5165\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u672a\u6765\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4fdd\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u53c2\u4e0e\u6743\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u8d85\u8d8a\u6280\u672f\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u91cd\u601d\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002"}}

UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap.

We introduce PoLR (Path of Least Resistance), the first inference-time method to leverage prefix consistency for compute-efficient reasoning. PoLR clusters short prefixes of reasoning traces, identifies the dominant cluster, and expands all paths in that cluster, preserving the accuracy benefits of SC while substantially reducing token usage and latency. Our theoretical analysis, framed via mutual information and entropy, explains why early reasoning steps encode strong signals predictive of final correctness. Empirically, PoLR consistently matches or exceeds SC across GSM8K, MATH500, AIME24/25, and GPQA-DIAMOND, reducing token usage by up to 60% and wall-clock latency by up to 50%.

Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose \"pixel MeanFlow\" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'pixel MeanFlow'\uff08pMF\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u5f0f\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0cpMF\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\uff08256x256\u5206\u8fa8\u7387FID=2.22\uff0c512x512\u5206\u8fa8\u7387FID=2.48\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u52a8\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5373\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u5f0f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fapixel MeanFlow\uff08pMF\uff09\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5206\u79bb\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u56fe\u50cf\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684x\uff09\u548c\u635f\u5931\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eMeanFlow\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "pMF\u5728ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86256\u00d7256\uff08FID=2.22\uff09\u548c512\u00d7512\uff08FID=2.48\uff09\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u3001\u65e0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "pMF\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u5f0f\u3001\u65e0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u548c\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u62d3\u5c55\u8be5\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

While \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a \"Noisy but Valid\" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical \"Oracle\" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u2018\u566a\u58f0\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u2019\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4f30\u8ba1LLM\u88c1\u5224\u7684TPR/FPR\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0bType-I\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0ePrediction-Powered Inference\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "LLM-as-a-Judge\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6027\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u88c1\u5224\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4f30\u8ba1TPR/FPR\u7684\u2018Noisy but Valid\u2019\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b9\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684Type-I\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5f0fPPI\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u88c1\u5224\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09\u7ed9\u51fa\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u9a8c\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5728Jigsaw\u3001Hate Speech\u4e0eSafeRLHF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u63ed\u793a\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u2018Oracle\u2019\uff08\u5df2\u77e5\u771f\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08Oracle Gap\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u88c1\u5224\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u5e26\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5398\u6e05\u4e86\u88c1\u5224\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8981\u6c42\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($\u03bb\\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08activation steering\uff09\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u60c5\u611f\u503e\u5411\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08\u03bb\u22480.15\uff09\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u76ee\u6807\u60c5\u7eea\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u538c\u6076\u548c\u6050\u60e7\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08r=0.776\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5347\u7ea7\u81f3Llama-3\u540e\u5f15\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u4fee\u6539LLM\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4ee5\u8c03\u63a7\u60c5\u611f\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N=190\uff0c7000+\u6761\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u7eea\uff08\u538c\u6076\u3001\u6050\u60e7\u3001\u60ca\u8bb6\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08\u03bb\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4Alpaca\u4e0eLlama-3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u6790\uff08\u03b7_p\u00b2\uff09\u3001\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\uff08r\uff09\u3001\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff08ICC\uff09\u7b49\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08\u03bb\u22480.15\uff09\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff1a\u538c\u6076\uff08\u03b7_p\u00b2=0.616\uff09\u548c\u6050\u60e7\uff08\u03b7_p\u00b2=0.540\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u60ca\u8bb6\u6700\u5f31\uff08\u03b7_p\u00b2=0.042\uff09\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u5747\u503cr=0.776\uff09\uff1bLlama-3\u76f8\u8f83Alpaca\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f15\u5bfc\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff08\u6240\u6709p<0.001\uff09\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08ICC=0.71\u20130.87\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7ecf\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u7b49\u5f71\u54cd\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u63a7LLM\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\u7684LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation).

Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.\n  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.\n  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.\n  Code Available at: https://github.com/Leeroo-AI/kapso", "AI": {"tldr": "KAPSO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u957f\u5468\u671f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u2018\u6784\u60f3-\u751f\u6210-\u6267\u884c-\u8bc4\u4f30-\u5b66\u4e60\u2019\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Git\u539f\u751f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u7801\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u5b9e\u9a8c\u72b6\u6001\u4e22\u5931\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u5f31\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKAPSO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09Git\u539f\u751f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f15\u64ce\uff08\u5206\u652f\u9694\u79bb\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u6574\u5408\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u3001\u6587\u6863\u3001\u8bba\u6587\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u7b49\u5e76\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5c42\uff08\u4ece\u8fd0\u884c\u65e5\u5fd7\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u63d0\u70bc\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728MLE-Bench\uff08\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ade\u8d5b\uff09\u548cALE-Bench\uff08\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u800c\u975e\u7ec8\u70b9\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a \"perception-reasoning-planning\" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDrive-KD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406-\u89c4\u5212\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u663e\u5b58\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u6f5c\u529b\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u663e\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDrive-KD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406-\u89c4\u5212\u4e09\u5143\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2\uff09\u4ee5\u5c42\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e3a\u84b8\u998f\u4fe1\u53f7\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u4e13\u7528\u5355\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u7f13\u89e3\u8de8\u80fd\u529b\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684InternVL3-1B\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7ea61B\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf78B\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0cGPU\u663e\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea642\u500d\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u7ea611.4\u500d\uff0c\u5728DriveBench\u4e0a\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-5.1\u3002", "conclusion": "Drive-KD\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u80fd\u529b\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms).

On the proxy task of removing medical capabilities, we show that the simple intervention of filtering pretraining data is highly effective, robust, and inexpensive at scale. Inspired by work on data attribution, we show that filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents, achieving the same hit to undesired capabilities at a lower cost to benign ones. Training models spanning two orders of magnitude, we then demonstrate that filtering gets more effective with scale: for our largest models, token filtering leads to a 7000x compute slowdown on the forget domain. We also show that models trained with token filtering can still be aligned on the forget domain. Along the way, we introduce a methodology for labeling tokens with sparse autoencoders and distilling cheap, high-quality classifiers.

Vukovic", "Jia Wu"], "title": "Modeling Endogenous Logic: Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation", "comment": "Accepted to The Web Conference (WWW) 2026", "summary": "Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction).

While adversarial transfer within neural networks is well-documented, whether classical ML pipelines using handcrafted features inherit this vulnerability when attacked via neural surrogates remains unexplored. Feature engineering creates information bottlenecks through gradient quantization and spatial binning, potentially filtering high-frequency adversarial signals. We evaluate this hypothesis through the first comprehensive study of adversarial transfer from DNNs to HOG-based classifiers. Using VGG16 as a surrogate, we generate FGSM and PGD adversarial examples and test transfer to four classical classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM) and a shallow neural network across eight HOG configurations on CIFAR-10. Our results strongly refute the protective hypothesis: all classifiers suffer 16.6%-59.1% relative accuracy drops, comparable to neural-to-neural transfer. More surprisingly, we discover attack hierarchy reversal--contrary to patterns where iterative PGD dominates FGSM within neural networks, FGSM causes greater degradation than PGD in 100% of classical ML cases, suggesting iterative attacks overfit to surrogate-specific features that don't survive feature extraction. Block normalization provides partial but insufficient mitigation. These findings demonstrate that adversarial vulnerability is not an artifact of end-to-end differentiability but a fundamental property of image classification systems, with implications for security-critical deployments across computational paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNN\uff09\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eHOG\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edfML\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u6837\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14FGSM\u6bd4PGD\u66f4\u5177\u7834\u574f\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u662f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u7ecf\u5178\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u662f\u5426\u7ee7\u627f\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u8d77\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5bf9\u6297\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5VGG16\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u751f\u6210FGSM\u548cPGD\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u56db\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08KNN\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u7ebf\u6027SVM\u3001\u6838SVM\uff09\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d45\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u516b\u79cdHOG\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5747\u51fa\u73b016.6%\u201359.1%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bFGSM\u5728100%\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6bd4PGD\u9020\u6210\u66f4\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u5757\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u9650\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\u7684\u526f\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u8de8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens.

However, a formal explanation of why the optimal target depends on the specific properties of the data remains elusive. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework based on a generalized prediction formulation that accommodates arbitrary output targets, of which $\\varepsilon$-, v-, and x-prediction are special cases. We derive the analytical relationship between data's geometry and the optimal prediction target, offering a rigorous justification for why x-prediction becomes superior when the ambient dimension significantly exceeds the data's intrinsic dimension. Furthermore, while our theory identifies dimensionality as the governing factor for the optimal prediction target, the intrinsic dimension of manifold-bound data is typically intractable to estimate in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose k-Diff, a framework that employs a data-driven approach to learn the optimal prediction parameter k directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit dimension estimation. Extensive experiments in both latent-space and pixel-space image generation demonstrate that k-Diff consistently outperforms fixed-target baselines across varying architectures and data scales, providing a principled and automated approach to enhancing generative performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u4e49\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u672c\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u03b5\u3001\u901f\u5ea6v\u6216\u76f4\u63a5\u6570\u636ex\uff09\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fak-Diff\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570k\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636ex\u4f18\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u03b5\u6216\u901f\u5ea6v\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u2018\u4e3a\u4f55\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u2019\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u6db5\u76d6\u03b5-\u3001v-\u3001x-\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u9884\u6d4b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u672c\u5f81\u7ef4\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7ef4\u4e4b\u6bd4\uff09\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fak-Diff\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u53c2\u6570k\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u73af\u5883\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0cx-prediction\u6700\u4f18\uff1bk-Diff\u5728\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5982DDPM\u3001Flow Matching\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6839\u672c\u56e0\u7d20\uff1bk-Diff\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Baji\u0107"], "title": "Lossy Common Information in a Learnable Gray-Wyner Network", "comment": null, "summary": "Many computer vision tasks share substantial overlapping information, yet conventional codecs tend to ignore this, leading to redundant and inefficient representations. The Gray-Wyner network, a classical concept from information theory, offers a principled framework for separating common and task-specific information. Inspired by this idea, we develop a learnable three-channel codec that disentangles shared information from task-specific details across multiple vision tasks. We characterize the limits of this approach through the notion of lossy common information, and propose an optimization objective that balances inherent tradeoffs in learning such representations. Through comparisons of three codec architectures on two-task scenarios spanning six vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces redundancy and consistently outperforms independent coding.

Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency.

However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the \"physics\" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRepository-Centric Learning\uff08RCL\uff09\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u201cphysics\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578bSWE-Spot-4B\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u90e8\u5206\u5546\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\u8feb\u5207\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u964c\u751f\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b66\u4e60\uff08TCL\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f25\u8865\u8be5\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RCL\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u800c\u975e\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5e7f\u5ea6\u8986\u76d6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56db\u5355\u5143\u2018Repository-Centric Experience\u2019\uff0c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u8bad\u7ec3SWE-Spot-4B\u7cfb\u5217\u5c0f\u578b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "SWE-Spot-4B\u5728\u591a\u4e2aSWE\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CWM\u3001Qwen3-Coder-30B\uff09\u53ca\u6548\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u5546\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-4.1-mini\u3001GPT-5-nano\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u66f4\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u638c\u63e1\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u667a\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u65b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e94\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u4e92\u8865\uff1bRCL\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models.

Despite being important, the roles of target vectors used in RM, however, remain underexplored. Here, we approach and revisit RM through the lens of the linear representation hypothesis. Specifically, if one can somehow identify a one-dimensional representation corresponding to a high-level concept, the linear representation hypothesis enables linear operations on this concept vector within the forget-representation space. Under this view, we hypothesize that, beyond forgetting, machine unlearning elicits controllable side behaviors and stronger side capabilities corresponding to the high-level concept. Our hypothesis is empirically validated across a wide range of tasks, including behavioral control (e.g., controlling unlearned models' truth, sentiment, and refusal) and capability enhancement (e.g., improving unlearned models' in-context learning capability).

Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates.

Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens.

Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.\n  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.\n  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency.

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects.

While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\\% and 4.63\\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6CoMT+CCRL\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u89e3\u9898\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60+\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u914d\uff09\u878d\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SFT+RL\uff09\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e3a\u5355\u4f4d\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u5b66\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u518d\u9002\u914d\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u8026\u5408\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09Chain-of-Meta-Thought\uff08CoMT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5265\u79bb\u5177\u4f53\u6267\u884c\uff09\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5143\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b2\uff09Confidence-Calibrated RL\uff08CCRL\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u5f15\u5165\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u30018\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cID\u548cOOD\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53472.19%\u548c4.63%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1165\u201370%\uff0ctoken\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u4f4e50%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification.

Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds.

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \\textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \\textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \\textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\\% to 39.0\\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\\% to 10.02\\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6SCMA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5206\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u52a0\u6743\u60e9\u7f5a\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u8026\u5408\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6613\u635f\u5bb3\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RL\u6846\u67b6SCMA\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5206\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u5757\uff09\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u5757\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff09\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u7b80\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\uff0cSCMA\u5c06\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c1111.1%\u201339.0%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u73874.33%\u201310.02%\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u6fc0\u53d1\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SCMA\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5197\u4f59\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u6d88\u9664\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3aLRM\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we uncover a striking \"Paradox of Robustness\": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be \"brittle\" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably \"stable\" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts.

In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold.

Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes.

This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\\underline{LI}ff\\underline{O}rd \\underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLION\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eClifford\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ffd\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u5ffd\u89c6\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\u5e26\u62d3\u6251\u5148\u9a8c\u7684token\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eClifford\u4ee3\u6570\u7684LION\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u5148\u4f20\u64ad\u540e\u805a\u5408\u2019\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u56fe\u4f20\u64ad\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50token\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u9636\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5168\u606f\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u9636\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLION\u57283\u7c7b\u56fe\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u548c3\u7c7b\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "LION\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.\n  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods.

To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings.

Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states.

These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing.

CORE optimizes a combined reward that balances (i) correctness, (ii) a lightweight DPP-inspired diversity term to reduce error overlap, and (iii) an explicit rescue bonus for successful recovery. We evaluate CORE across four standard reasoning datasets GSM8K, MATH, AIME, and GPQA.

Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \\emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\uff08IDP\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u641c\u7d22\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08SBST\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6587\u6863\u914d\u7f6e\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u98ce\u9669\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u79cd\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u8fdb\u5316\u3001\u7fa4\u667a\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u5168\u90e8\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a8\u8350\u91c7\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7IDP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u4fdd\u9669\u3001\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6700\u5dee\u6587\u6863\u3002", "method": "\u5c06IDP\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3aSBST\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u6863\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6e32\u67d3\u7ed3\u6784\u98ce\u9669\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u8bf1\u53d1\u771f\u5b9e\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u7fa4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u7b49\u591a\u7c7b\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u914d\u7f6e\u6392\u4ed6\u6027\u3001\u80dc\u7387\u548c\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\u5206\u6790\u5176\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u73b0\u5f7c\u6b64\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5404\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u65e0\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u5907\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u5408\u53ef\u8986\u76d6\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u5931\u8d25\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u4efb\u4e00\u5355\u72ec\u7b56\u7565\u5747\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5404\u7c7bSBST\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4e1aIDP\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5168\u9762\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RecNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f20\u64ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u53cc\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002RecNet\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u5236\uff09\u548c\u540e\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u7269\u54c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRecNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u524d\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u8def\u7531\u5668\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u8def\u7531 + \u5e26\u7f13\u51b2\u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\u6ee4\u6ce2\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u504f\u597d\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u5236\uff09\u548c\u540e\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u4f20\u64ad\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRecNet\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u504f\u597d\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RecNet\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u53cc\u5411\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight \"scouts\" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSCOUT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u2018scout\u2019\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u7b26\u53f7/\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b49\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u7b26\u53f7\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u56e0\u5e76\u975e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bd5\u9519\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCOUT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7528\u8f7b\u91cfMLP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u2018scout\u2019\u5feb\u901f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a2\u7d22\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5176\u9690\u542b\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u52060.86\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aGemini-2.5-Pro\uff080.60\uff09\uff0cGPU\u5c0f\u65f6\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea660%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u662f\u63d0\u5347LLM\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cf\u4ee3\u7406\u8f85\u52a9+\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u91ca\u653eLLM\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This approach also supports dual-perspective modelling, capturing how players interpret identical situations differently. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory-based concept recognition, with movement patterns aligning with expert commentary.

The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably.

Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements.

The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates.

With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings.

Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff08ECG\uff09\u4e13\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FMs\uff09\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7SHAP\u548cUMAP\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ECG\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u5f81\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8868\u5f81\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\uff08\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff09\u548cUMAP\uff08\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u964d\u7ef4\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6d32\u9645\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff08\u542b\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u591a\u79cdECG\u4e13\u5bb6FM\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u6df1\u5165\u63ed\u793aECG\u4e13\u5bb6FM\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u90e8\u7f72ECG\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u533b\u7597AI\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5730\u4f4d\u3002"}}

Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u51b3\u7b56\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8fd0\u8425\u5173\u952e\u7ee9\u6548\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u603b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982MAE\u3001RMSE\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u8425KPI\uff08\u5982\u6210\u672c\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd0\u8425\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(i) \u9762\u5411\u5907\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5408\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b(ii) \u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b(iii) \u6d88\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd0\u8425KPI\u7684\u5e93\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6539\u5584\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u8fd0\u8425\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6210\u672c-\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u8fd0\u8425\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6c7d\u8f66\u552e\u540e\u53ca\u7c7b\u4f3c\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u9009\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \\textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining.

In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points.

Yet, this modularity also creates a \\emph{governance gap}: downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Because existing defenses are largely post-hoc and architecture-specific, they provide inconsistent protection across diverse architectures and release formats in practice. To close this gap, we propose \\textsc{Trap}$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework that encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning, regardless of whether they are released as adapters or full models. Instead of relying on architecture-dependent approaches, \\textsc{Trap}$^{2}$ uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process. It keeps released weights effective in standalone use, but degrades them under re-scaling that often arises in merging, undermining unauthorized merging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTrap\u00b2\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u7f16\u7801\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u590d\u7528\u66f4\u52a0\u4fbf\u6377\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6cbb\u7406\u7f3a\u53e3\uff1a\u4e0b\u6e38\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u5c06\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4f53\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6216\u8bb8\u53ef\u6761\u6b3e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4e8b\u540e\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\u683c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrap\u00b2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5177\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u53d1\u5e03\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5408\u5e76\u5e38\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u963b\u788d\u672a\u6388\u6743\u5408\u5e76\u3002", "result": "Trap\u00b2\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3001\u5168\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5355\u72ec\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Trap\u00b2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7248\u6743\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u53d1\u73af\u8282\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u524d\u7f6e\u6027\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight.

Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales.

Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faToolWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u5e8f\u5217\u800c\u975e\u72ec\u7acbtoken\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bcd\u6c47\u589e\u957f\u5bf9\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5171\u73b0\u589e\u5f3a\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u8fd14.7\u4e07\u5de5\u5177\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u8db3\u548cLLM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56fa\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u4e3b\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u552f\u4e00\u65b0token\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bcd\u6c47\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u53ca\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToolWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u5206\u8bcd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u5de5\u5177\u5185\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u5916\u5728\u5171\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u5c42\u4ee3\u7801\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u8be5\u5206\u5c42\u4ee3\u7801\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fd147,000\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cToolWeaver\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ToolWeaver\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVAF\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7f51\u9875\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9Web\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u9879\u76ee\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5361\u7247\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u800c\u5b57\u4f53\u6837\u5f0f\u3001\u6587\u672c\u989c\u8272\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8Web\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u504f\u597d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVAF\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d4f\u89c8\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u6eda\u52a8\u4e0e\u70b9\u51fb\uff09\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u53ca\u7387\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u7c7b48\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\u30015\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7ad9\u30014\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41Web\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u80cc\u666f\u8272\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u9879\u76ee\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5361\u7247\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u5f3a\uff1b\u5b57\u4f53\u6837\u5f0f\u3001\u6587\u672c\u989c\u8272\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "Web\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u597d\uff0cVAF\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u654f\u611f\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark.

Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($\u03c1$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $\u03c1$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9648\u8ff0\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u63ed\u793a\u504f\u597d\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08SvR gap\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u504f\u597d elicitation \u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u7acb/\u5f03\u6743\u9009\u9879\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u9648\u8ff0\u4e0e\u63ed\u793a\u504f\u597d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u63ed\u793a\u9636\u6bb5\u5141\u8bb8\u5f03\u6743\u53cd\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4ea6\u672a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6539\u5584\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4e8c\u5143\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\uff09\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u534f\u8bae\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u6df7\u6742\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8861\u91cf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684 stated-revealed \u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u572824\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u597delicitation\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u5305\u62ec\u662f\u5426\u5141\u8bb8\u4e2d\u7acb/\u5f03\u6743\u9009\u9879\u3001\u662f\u5426\u5728revealed\u504f\u597d\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528system prompt\u8fdb\u884cstated\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97Spearman\u79e9\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u03c1\u3002", "result": "\u5141\u8bb8\u4e2d\u7acb/\u5f03\u6743\u63d0\u5347stated\u4e0eforced-choice revealed\u504f\u597d\u7684\u03c1\uff1b\u4f46\u5728revealed\u9636\u6bb5\u5141\u8bb8\u5f03\u6743\u5bfc\u81f4\u03c1\u8d8b\u8fd1\u96f6\u6216\u8d1f\u503c\uff1bsystem prompt\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728AIRiskDilemmas\u4e0a\u672a\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u5347\u03c1\u3002", "conclusion": "SvR\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56elicitation\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u6d4b\u91cf\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a/\u65e0\u504f\u597d\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u7b80\u5355\u5957\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVERSA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u8db3\u7403\u8d5b\u4e8b\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982VAEP\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8db3\u7403\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u5982\u4e8b\u4ef6\u987a\u5e8f\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u7684VERSA\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728K\u8054\u8d5b2024\u8d5b\u5b63\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b018.81%\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bVERSA\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86VAEP\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0cVERSA\u4e3a\u4f53\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u969c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound.

In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CAR-bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8f66\u8f7d\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b67\u4e49\u6d88\u89e3\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5ffd\u89c6\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u8f66\u8f7d\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\uff09\u4e2d\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u9075\u5faa\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCAR-bench\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u3001\u5185\u7f6e\u9886\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u300158\u4e2a\u4e92\u8fde\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5bfc\u822a/\u529e\u516c/\u5145\u7535/\u8f66\u63a7\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u7c7b\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u2014\u2014Hallucination\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f/\u5de5\u5177\u4e0b\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u610f\u8bc6\uff09\u548cDisambiguation\uff08\u8981\u6c42\u901a\u8fc7\u6f84\u6e05\u6216\u5185\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u6b67\u4e49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u6cbf\u63a8\u7406\u578bLLM\u5728Disambiguation\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u901a\u8fc7\u7387<50%\uff0c\u5e38\u56e0\u8fc7\u65e9\u6267\u884c\u800c\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u5728Hallucination\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u8fdd\u53cd\u653f\u7b56\u6216\u634f\u9020\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u76f2\u533a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u81ea\u77e5\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data.

Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity.

Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics.

Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDASH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u5e93\u68c0\u7d22\uff08PLR\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08LHD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u7ec8\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u4e00\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u6536\u655b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics\uff08DASH\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Profiled Library Retrieval\uff08PLR\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u540c\u6b65\u5f52\u6863\u4e13\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cDASH\u5c06\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53473\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e90%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684LLM\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "DASH\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u655b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5e93\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LHD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute.

We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper.

Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u578b\uff08CDM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u5f0f\u9690\u5f0f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u66f4\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4e25\u683c\u6ee1\u8db3\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1a\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u6613\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u6cd5\u5185\u5316\u89e3\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u578b\uff08CDM\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u52a0\u566a\u72b6\u6001\u6062\u590d\u5e72\u51c0\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6307\u5411\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5411\u5e73\u8861\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCDM\u6bd4\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u672a\u63a5\u89e6\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ea6\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u566a\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u76d1\u7763\u5373\u53ef\u5185\u5316\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In operational environments, however, monitoring systems frequently experience sensor churn. Signals may appear, disappear, or be renamed, creating data windows where the cardinality varies and may include values unseen during training. To address this challenge, we propose SMKC, a framework that decouples the dynamic input structure from the anomaly detector. We first employ permutation-invariant feature hashing to sketch raw inputs into a fixed size state sequence. We then construct a hybrid kernel image to capture global temporal structure through pairwise comparisons of the sequence and its derivatives. The model learns normal patterns using masked reconstruction and a teacher-student prediction objective. Our evaluation reveals that robust log-distance channels provide the primary discriminative signal, whereas cosine representations often fail to capture sufficient contrast. Notably, we find that a detector using random projections and nearest neighbors on the SMKC representation performs competitively with fully trained baselines without requiring gradient updates. This highlights the effectiveness of the representation itself and offers a practical cold-start solution for resource-constrained deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSMKC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u54c8\u5e0c\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6838\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5047\u8bbe\u89c2\u6d4b\u53d8\u91cf\u96c6\u5408\u9759\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5e38\u53d1\u751f\u589e\u5220\u6539\uff08sensor churn\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u672a\u89c1\u503c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSMKC\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u54c8\u5e0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u6838\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u5e8f\u5217\u53ca\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u5e08\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u6570\u8ddd\u79bb\u901a\u9053\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e3b\u8981\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f59\u5f26\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eSMKC\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71+\u8fd1\u90bb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u5373\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "SMKC\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u8026\u52a8\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad.

We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability.

Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales.

An Investigation Into the Group-theoretic Structures Learned By Narrow Models Trained To Predict Group Operations", "comment": "Presented at TAG-DS 2025", "summary": "While a real-world research program in mathematics may be guided by a motivating question, the process of mathematical discovery is typically open-ended. Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5f0f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u7fa4\u8fd0\u7b97\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u6216\u7f6e\u6362\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u62bd\u8c61\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u90e8\u5206\u62bd\u8c61\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u5982\u5355\u4f4d\u5143\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u8003\u8bd5\u5f0f\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7684\u3001\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22AI\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u53d1\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u8868\u5f81\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u7fa4\u8fd0\u7b97\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u3001\u7f6e\u6362\u5408\u6210\uff09\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a84\u57df\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u9690\u542b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7fa4\u8bba\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\u5355\u4f4d\u5143\u3001\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\uff09\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3001\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u68c0\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u67d0\u4e9b\u62bd\u8c61\u4ee3\u6570\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff1b\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u533a\u5206\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u7fa4\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u65e0\u5b50\u7fa4\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\uff09\uff1b\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u53d6\u5355\u4f4d\u5143\u7b49\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e5f\u8574\u542b\u53ef\u88ab\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u62bd\u8c61\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8868\u660eAI\u6709\u671b\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u672c\u8d28\u3002"}}

We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality.

Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \\textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \\textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u6216\u591a\u6b65\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6Bi-stage Flow Refinement\uff08BFR\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u589e\u5f3a\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cbODE\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7cbe\u70bc\uff08BFR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u9006\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u5e26\u8f7b\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u70bc\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u4fee\u6b63\u5747\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5355\u6b65\u3001\u4e0d\u6270\u52a8\u539fODE\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u3001CIFAR-10\u548c256\u00d7256 FFHQ\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86FID\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff1bMNIST\u4e0a\u4eceFID 3.95\u63d0\u5347\u81f31.46\uff08SOTA\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u97001\u6b21\u989d\u5916\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\uff081-NFE\uff09\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BFR\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7cbe\u70bc\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models.

Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution.

Here, f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginal densities that capture structured interactions, a setting central to diffusion-based generative models. We provide a concise proof for approximating these ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with the SignReLU activation function, leveraging the activation's piecewise structure. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates. Specializing to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), we construct a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the reverse process and derive bounds on the excess Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk between the generated and true data distributions. Our analysis decomposes this excess risk into approximation and estimation error components. These results provide generalization guarantees for finite-sample training of diffusion-based generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSignReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u578b\u51fd\u6570\uff08f1/f2\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DDPM\uff09\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u9006\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53caKL\u98ce\u9669\u754c\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5448\u6bd4\u7387\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08f1/f2\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8be5\u6bd4\u7387\u5bf9\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fb9\u7f18\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528SignReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u903c\u8fd1\u6bd4\u7387\u578b\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfcL^p(Omega)\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9DDPM\u8bbe\u8ba1SignReLU\u795e\u7ecf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176KL\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u7387\u578b\u51fd\u6570\u7684L^p\u903c\u8fd1\u754c\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff1b\u4e3aDDPM\u9006\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6784\u9020\u4e86SignReLU\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1b\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u95f4\u8d85\u989dKL\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86SignReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6bd4\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u6027\u3002"}}

In particular, interfering substances cause nonspecific peaks, residence time shifts, and increased background noise, resulting in reduced sensitivity and false alarms. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework. We also verify how the generative model improves the performance of the AI discrimination framework. Representatively, the proposed method is shown to consistently achieve cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient values above 0.9 while preserving peak number diversity and reducing false alarms in the discrimination model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5cf0\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5224\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5e72\u6270\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bGC-MS\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7a81\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u5cf0\u3001\u878d\u5408\u5316\u5b66\u4e0e\u6eb6\u5242\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3aAI\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "GC-MS\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u8d28\u65f6\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u975e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5cf0\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5cf0\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CGAN\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5cf0\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u7a81\u51faGC-MS\u7279\u5f81\u5cf0\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u4e0e\u6eb6\u5242\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u81f3\u9690\u5411\u91cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5408\u6210GC-MS\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548c\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u8d850.9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u5cf0\u6570\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u5cf0\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfGC-MS\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AI\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u5b9e\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8d28\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge.

This paper proposes Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion (PILD), a framework that unifies diffusion modeling and first-principles physical constraints by introducing a virtual residual observation sampled from a Laplace distribution to supervise generation during training. To further integrate physical laws, a conditional embedding module is incorporated to inject physical information into the denoising network at multiple layers, ensuring consistent guidance throughout the diffusion process. The proposed PILD framework is concise, modular, and broadly applicable to problems governed by ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, as well as algebraic equations or inequality constraints. Extensive experiments across engineering and scientific tasks including estimating vehicle trajectories, tire forces, Darcy flow and plasma dynamics, demonstrate that our PILD substantially improves accuracy, stability, and generalization over existing physics-informed and diffusion-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPILD\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u865a\u62df\u6b8b\u5dee\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u7269\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u9075\u5faa\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPhysics-Informed Learning via Diffusion\uff08PILD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u865a\u62df\u6b8b\u5dee\u89c2\u6d4b\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u7f51\u7edc\u591a\u5c42\u6ce8\u5165\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u8f6e\u80ce\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u8fbe\u897f\u6d41\u4e0e\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cPILD\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PILD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u542b\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u53ca\u4ee3\u6570/\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We propose the Physics-Guided Tiny-Mamba Transformer (PG-TMT), a compact tri-branch encoder tailored for online condition monitoring. A depthwise-separable convolutional stem captures micro-transients, a Tiny-Mamba state-space branch models near-linear long-range dynamics, and a lightweight local Transformer encodes cross-channel resonances. We derive an analytic temporal-to-spectral mapping that ties the model's attention spectrum to classical bearing fault-order bands, yielding a band-alignment score that quantifies physical plausibility and provides physics-grounded explanations. To ensure decision reliability, healthy-score exceedances are modeled with extreme-value theory (EVT), which yields an on-threshold achieving a target false-alarm intensity (events/hour); a dual-threshold hysteresis with a minimum hold time further suppresses chatter. Under a leakage-free streaming protocol with right-censoring of missed detections on CWRU, Paderborn, XJTU-SY, and an industrial pilot, PG-TMT attains higher precision-recall AUC (primary under imbalance), competitive or better ROC AUC, and shorter mean time-to-detect at matched false-alarm intensity, together with strong cross-domain transfer.

While recent methods often rely on heuristic approaches to balance efficiency and quality, the fundamental relationship between original and synthetic data remains underexplored. This paper revisits knowledge distillation-based dataset distillation within a solid theoretical framework. We introduce the concepts of Informativeness and Utility, capturing crucial information within a sample and essential samples in the training set, respectively. Building on these principles, we define optimal dataset distillation mathematically. We then present InfoUtil, a framework that balances informativeness and utility in synthesizing the distilled dataset.

In this setting, one has access to labeled data only from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. The central objective is to leverage the source data and the unlabeled target data to build models that generalize to the target domain. Despite its potential, existing UDA approaches often struggle in practice, particularly in scenarios where the target domain offers only limited unlabeled data or spurious correlations dominate the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust learning framework that models uncertainty in both the covariate distribution and the conditional label distribution. Our approach is motivated by the multi-source domain adaptation setting but is also directly applicable to the single-source scenario, making it versatile in practice.

To enable truly efficient and seamless door-to-door travel experiences, UAM requires close integration with existing ground transportation infrastructure. However, current research on optimal integrated routing strategies for passengers in air-ground mobility systems remains limited, with a lack of systematic exploration.To address this gap, we first propose a unified optimization model that integrates strategy selection for both air and ground transportation. This model captures the dynamic characteristics of multimodal transport networks and incorporates real-time traffic conditions alongside passenger decision-making behavior. Building on this model, we propose a Unified Air-Ground Mobility Coordination (UAGMC) framework, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vertiport selection and dynamically plan air taxi routes. Experimental results demonstrate that UAGMC achieves a 34\\% reduction in average travel time compared to conventional proportional allocation methods, enhancing overall travel efficiency and providing novel insights into the integration and optimization of multimodal transportation systems.

Existing approaches mainly focus on data centric or model centric modifications, treating the diffusion model as an isolated predictor. In this paper, we study memorization in diffusion models from a denoising centric perspective. We show that uniform timestep sampling leads to unequal learning contributions across denoising steps due to differences in signal to noise ratio, which biases training toward memorization. To address this, we propose a timestep sampling strategy that explicitly controls where learning occurs along the denoising trajectory. By adjusting the width of the confidence interval, our method provides direct control over the memorization generalization trade off. Experiments on image and 1D signal generation tasks demonstrate that shifting learning emphasis toward later denoising steps consistently reduces memorization and improves distributional alignment with training data, validating the generality and effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u53bb\u566a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a7\u5236\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5bf9\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7d27\u5bc6\u5339\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u54ea\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c1D\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u70b9\u5411\u540e\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u504f\u79fb\u53ef\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316-\u6cdb\u5316\u6743\u8861\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Low-rank \\& Lipschitz-controlled Routing (L2R), a unified routing framework that reshapes both the routing space and scoring geometry. L2R performs expert assignment in a shared low-rank latent routing space and introduces Saturated Inner-Product Scoring (SIPS) to explicitly control the Lipschitz behavior of routing functions, yielding smoother and more stable routing geometry. In addition, L2R incorporates a parameter-efficient multi-anchor routing mechanism to enhance expert expressiveness.

While AFD enables independent scaling of memory and compute resources, its performance is highly sensitive to the Attention/FFN provisioning ratio: mis-sizing induces step-level blocking and costly device idle time. We develop a tractable analytical framework for sizing AFD bundles in an $r$A-$1$F topology, where the key difficulty is that Attention-side work is nonstationary-token context grows and requests are continuously replenished with random lengths-while FFN work is stable given the aggregated batch. Using a probabilistic workload model, we derive closed-form rules for the optimal A/F ratio that maximize average throughput per instance across the system.

Additionally, multi-task learning methods struggle with task imbalance and negative transfer, especially when modeling various service types. To overcome these challenges, we propose Sim-MSTNet, a multi-task spatiotemporal network traffic forecasting model based on the sim2real approach. Our method leverages a simulator to generate synthetic data, effectively addressing the issue of poor generalization caused by data scarcity. By employing a domain randomization technique, we reduce the distributional gap between synthetic and real data through bi-level optimization of both sample weighting and model training. Moreover, Sim-MSTNet incorporates attention-based mechanisms to selectively share knowledge between tasks and applies dynamic loss weighting to balance task objectives.

However, the former approach suffers from unstable credit assignment, while the latter exhibits sample inefficiency and sub-optimality. We propose a policy optimization framework that leverages multiple intrinsic rewards to directly optimize a policy for an extrinsic reward without pretraining subpolicies.

However, the deep-thinking mode often leads to unnecessarily lengthy reasoning and resource inefficiency when handling simple tasks. This overthinking phenomenon may arise from the generation preference triggered by the reward function during post-training. Existing research attempts to mitigate overthinking from the perspective of prompt design or model training, but generally underestimates the importance of task difficulty awareness, which makes it difficult for LRMs to effectively allocate reasoning resources. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-aware Policy Optimization (DiPO), a reinforcement learning-based LRM training framework. DiPO encourages LRM to spontaneously model task complexity, and integrates them into reinforcement learning framework to adjust the generation preferences introduced by post-training. A difficulty modeling method based on model self-reasoning is proposed, which significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotation and formalize task complexity. We further develop a difficulty-signal-enhanced reward function that incorporates a penalty for lengthy reasoning while considering reasoning performance and output format.

This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a \"Symmetric Conservatism\" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the \"Reward Collapse\" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a \"Boost Factor\" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an \"Entropy Aware Penalty\" to break information cocoons. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that SAGE effectively unblocks cold-start traffic and sustains recommendation diversity, all while retaining the numerical stability of GBPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSAGE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3OneRec\u4e2d\u8bcd\u6c47\u72ec\u7acb\u53ca\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982OneRec\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u72ec\u7acb\u8bcd\u8868\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5GBPO\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9879\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAGE\uff08Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\u2014\u2014\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6bd4\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6d88\u9664token\u7ea7\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u2014\u2014\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5bf9\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9879\u65bd\u52a0\u2018\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u5b50\u2019\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u60e9\u7f5a\u2019\u6253\u7834\u4fe1\u606f\u8327\u623f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAGE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u7ef4\u6301\u63a8\u8350\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559GBPO\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u72ec\u7acb\u8bcd\u8868\u7684\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5217\u8868\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While current models effectively capture character tones and knowledge, simulating the inner thoughts behind their behaviors remains a challenge. Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation. HER introduces dual-layer thinking, which distinguishes characters' first-person thinking from LLMs' third-person thinking. To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train \\method models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench.

In contrast, the tokenizer embedding table, which is natively sparse, largely avoids these issues by selecting a single embedding per token at the cost of not having contextual information. In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5Large Lookup Layer\uff08L\u00b3\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001token\u8def\u7531\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b49\u7a00\u758fMoE\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MoE\u52a8\u6001\u786c\u8def\u7531\u5b58\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u867d\u5929\u7136\u7a00\u758f\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u7a00\u758f\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLarge Lookup Layer\uff08L\u00b3\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u7cfb\u7edf\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u9759\u6001token\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0eCPU\u5378\u8f7d\u63a8\u7406\uff1b(2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe2.6B\u6d3b\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u7684Transformer\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cL\u00b3\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b49\u7a00\u758fMoE\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "L\u00b3\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u601d\u60f3\u5411\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5Reset-and-Discard\uff08ReD\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684coverage@cost\uff08\u5355\u4f4d\u6210\u672c\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8epass@k\u9884\u6d4b\u8282\u7701\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6b21\u6570\u6216\u63a8\u65ad\u5176\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807pass@k\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620LLM\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6307\u6807coverage@cost\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReset-and-Discard\uff08ReD\uff09\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7f6e\u4e0e\u4e22\u5f03\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347coverage@cost\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4ecepass@k\u5b9a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7701\u6216\u53cd\u63a8\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanEval\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cReD\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fbe\u6210\u76ee\u6807coverage\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6b21\u6570\u3001token\u91cf\u548c\u7f8e\u5143\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ReD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u4f4d\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8986\u76d6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

Population-based, gradient-free optimization circumvents backpropagation through non-differentiable spike dynamics by estimating gradients. However, with finite populations, high variance of these estimates can induce harmful and overly aggressive update steps. Inspired by trust-region methods in reinforcement learning that constrain policy updates in distribution space, we propose \\textbf{Signal-Adaptive Trust Regions (SATR)}, a distributional update rule that constrains relative change by bounding KL divergence normalized by an estimated signal energy. SATR automatically expands the trust region under strong signals and contracts it when updates are noise-dominated. We instantiate SATR for Bernoulli connectivity distributions, which have shown strong empirical performance for RSNN optimization. Across a suite of high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks, SATR improves stability under limited populations and reaches competitive returns against strong baselines including PPO-LSTM.

Recent work has shown that sampling from the power distribution of LLMs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can recover performance comparable to RL post-training without relying on external rewards; however, the high computational cost of MCMC makes such approaches impractical for widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded alternative that eliminates the need for iterative MCMC. We derive a novel formulation showing that the global power distribution can be approximated by a token-level scaled low-temperature one, where the scaling factor captures future trajectory quality. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a training-free and verifier-free algorithm that sharpens the base model's generative distribution autoregressively. Empirically, we evaluate our method on math, QA, and code tasks across four LLMs, and show that our method matches or surpasses one-shot GRPO without relying on any external rewards, while reducing inference latency by over 10x compared to MCMC-based sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u9510\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 token \u7ea7\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u5c40\u5e42\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a GRPO\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6bd4 MCMC \u964d\u4f4e 10 \u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 RL \u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u9510\u5316\u800c\u975e\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u4e60\u5f97\uff1bMCMC \u91c7\u6837\u867d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u9510\u5316\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u5e42\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u7531 token \u7ea7\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u52a0\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5f0f\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u3001verifier-free \u7684\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u9510\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e8e\u56db\u4e2a LLM \u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u5373\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7 one-shot GRPO \u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6bd4 MCMC \u964d\u4f4e\u8d85 10 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u9510\u5316\u662f\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9510\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3 RL \u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e MCMC \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We investigate the geometric limits of the Linear Propagation Assumption (LPA), the premise that local updates coherently propagate to logical consequences. To formalize this, we adopt relation algebra and study three core operations on relations: negation flips truth values, converse swaps argument order, and composition chains relations. For negation and converse, we prove that guaranteeing direction-agnostic first-order propagation necessitates a tensor factorization separating entity-pair context from relation content. However, for composition, we identify a fundamental obstruction. We show that composition reduces to conjunction, and prove that any conjunction well-defined on linear features must be bilinear.

While test-time training (TTT) offers a promising solution, existing Parameter Finetuning (PaFT) paradigm suffer from catastrophic forgetting, hindering their real-world applicability. We propose TTReFT, a novel Test-Time Representation FineTuning framework that transitions the adaptation target from model parameters to latent representations. Specifically, TTReFT achieves this through three key innovations: (1) uncertainty-guided node selection for specific interventions, (2) low-rank representation interventions that preserve pre-trained knowledge, and (3) an intervention-aware masked autoencoder that dynamically adjust masking strategy to accommodate the node selection scheme.

The root cause lies in the Hessian matrix of the LLM loss landscape: a few high curvature directions are extremely sensitive to perturbations. To address this, we propose the Hessian Robust Quantization (HeRo Q) algorithm, which applies a lightweight, learnable rotation-compression matrix to the weight space prior to quantization. This joint framework reshapes the loss landscape by reducing the largest Hessian eigenvalue and reducing its max eigenvalue, thereby significantly enhancing robustness to quantization noise. HeRo-Q requires no architectural modifications, incurs negligible computational overhead, and integrates seamlessly into existing PTQ pipelines. Experiments on Llama and Qwen models show that HeRo Q consistently outperforms state of the art methods including GPTQ, AWQ, and SpinQuant not only achieving superior performance under standard W4A8 settings, but also excelling in the highly challenging W3A16 ultra low bit regime, where it boosts GSM8K accuracy on Llama3 8B to 70.15\\% and effectively avoids the logical collapse commonly seen in aggressive quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHessian Robust Quantization (HeRo Q)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u524d\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c-\u538b\u7f29\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u91cd\u5851\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4eHessian\u6700\u5927\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728W4A8\u548c\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684W3A16\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGPTQ\u3001AWQ\u548cSpinQuant\u7b49SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Post Training Quantization (PTQ)\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4'\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u9ad8\u635f\u5931'\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u7684Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u5b58\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u6781\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHessian Robust Quantization (HeRo Q)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u524d\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c-\u538b\u7f29\u77e9\u9635\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4eHessian\u6700\u5927\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u91cd\u5851\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama\u548cQwen\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHeRo Q\u5728W4A8\u6807\u51c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u53caW3A16\u8d85\u4f4e\u4f4d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGPTQ\u3001AWQ\u548cSpinQuant\uff1b\u5728Llama3 8B\u4e0a\u5c06GSM8K\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f370.15%\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u903b\u8f91\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "HeRo Q\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hessian\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSeg-MoE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6bb5\u7ea7\u7a00\u758fMoE\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6309\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u6bb5\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2atoken\u8fdb\u884c\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u5e8f\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eMoE\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528token-wise\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5951\u5408\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeg-MoE\uff1a\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6bb5\u6574\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u548c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u6bb5\u5185\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217Transformer\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSeg-MoE\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6Transformer\u53ca\u5df2\u6709token-wise MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6bb5\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06MoE\u8def\u7531\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u7a00\u758f\u67b6\u6784\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing similarity measures such as CKA or SVCCA capture pointwise overlap between activation sets, but miss how representations change along input paths. Two models may appear nearly identical under these metrics yet respond very differently to perturbations or adversarial stress. We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the \"twist\" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii.

We present SENDAI, a hierarchical Sparse-measurement, EfficieNt Data AssImilation Framework that reconstructs full spatial states from hyper sparse sensor observations by combining simulation-derived priors with learned discrepancy corrections. We demonstrate the performance on satellite remote sensing, reconstructing MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived vegetation index fields across six globally distributed sites. Using seasonal periods as a proxy for domain shift, the framework consistently outperforms established baselines that require substantially denser observations -- SENDAI achieves a maximum SSIM improvement of 185% over traditional baselines and a 36% improvement over recent high-frequency-based methods. These gains are particularly pronounced for landscapes with sharp boundaries and sub-seasonal dynamics; more importantly, the framework effectively preserves diagnostically relevant structures -- such as field topologies, land cover discontinuities, and spatial gradients. By yielding corrections that are more structurally and spectrally separable, the reconstructed fields are better suited for downstream inference of indirectly observed variables. The results therefore highlight a lightweight and operationally viable framework for sparse-measurement reconstruction that is applicable to physically grounded inference, resource-limited deployment, and real-time monitor and control.", "AI": {"tldr": "SENDAI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u573a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a00\u758f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSENDAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u7a7a\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728MODIS\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSSIM\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347185%\uff0c\u8f83\u9ad8\u9891\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534736%\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5730\u5f62\u62d3\u6251\u3001\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "SENDAI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u90e8\u7f72\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, policies trained by standard expected return maximization routinely collapse onto a small subset of outcomes, a phenomenon commonly attributed to insufficient exploration or weak regularization. We show that this explanation is incomplete: outcome level mode collapse is a structural consequence of the expected-return objective itself. Under idealized learning dynamics, the log-probability ratio between any two outcomes evolves linearly in their reward difference, implying exponential ratio divergence and inevitable collapse independent of the exploration strategy, entropy regularization, or optimization algorithm. We identify the source of this pathology as the probability multiplier inside the expectation and propose a minimal correction: inverse probability scaling, which removes outcome-frequency amplification from the learning signal, fundamentally changes the learning dynamics, and provably yields reward-proportional terminal distributions, preventing collapse in multimodal settings. We instantiate this principle in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a drop-in modification, IPS-GRPO, requiring no auxiliary models or architectural changes. Across different reasoning and molecular generation tasks, IPS-GRPO consistently reduces outcome-level mode collapse while matching or exceeding baseline performance, suggesting that correcting the objective rather than adding exploration heuristics is key to reliable multimodal policy optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\u5c42\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u4fee\u6b63\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08IPS-GRPO\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a2\u7d22\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u7ec8\u7aef\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u662f\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u4e58\u5b50\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u9891\u7387\u88ab\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6bd4\u7387\u53d1\u6563\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\uff08IPS\uff09\u4fee\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u878d\u5165Group Relative Policy Optimization\uff08GRPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u52a8\u7684IPS-GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cIPS-GRPO\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7ed3\u679c\u5c42\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fee\u6b63\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u6bd4\u6dfb\u52a0\u63a2\u7d22\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u66f4\u80fd\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9006\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u666e\u9002\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

On one hand, purely unsupervised approaches have proven successful on fully disentangled synthetic data, but fail to recover semantic factors from real data without strong inductive biases. On the other hand, supervised approaches are unstable and hard to scale to large attribute sets because they rely on adversarial objectives or auxiliary classifiers.\n  We introduce \\textsc{XFactors}, a weakly-supervised VAE framework that disentangles and provides explicit control over a chosen set of factors. Building on the Disentangled Information Bottleneck perspective, we decompose the representation into a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ and factor-specific subspaces $\\mathcal{T}_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal{T}_K$ and a residual subspace $\\mathcal{S}$. Each target factor is encoded in its assigned $\\mathcal{T}_i$ through contrastive supervision: an InfoNCE loss pulls together latents sharing the same factor value and pushes apart mismatched pairs. In parallel, KL regularization imposes a Gaussian structure on both $\\mathcal{S}$ and the aggregated factor subspaces, organizing the geometry without additional supervision for non-targeted factors and avoiding adversarial training and classifiers.\n  Across multiple datasets, with constant hyperparameters, \\textsc{XFactors} achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement scores and yields consistent qualitative factor alignment in the corresponding subspaces, enabling controlled factor swapping via latent replacement. We further demonstrate that our method scales correctly with increasing latent capacity and evaluate it on the real-world dataset CelebA.

Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink.

While predicting the future state introduces bias, conditioning the IDM on the prediction can significantly reduce variance. We establish conditions on the state predictor bias for PIDM to achieve lower prediction error and higher sample efficiency than BC, with the gap widening when additional data sources are available. We validate the theoretical insights empirically in 2D navigation tasks, where BC requires up to five times (three times on average) more demonstrations than PIDM to reach comparable performance; and in a complex 3D environment in a modern video game with high-dimensional visual inputs and stochastic transitions, where BC requires over 66\\% more samples than PIDM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPIDM\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08BC\uff09\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u6e90\u4e8e\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5e26\u6765\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee5\u8be5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u5747\u8868\u660ePIDM\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08BC\uff09\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u671f\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PIDM\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u673a\u7406\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acbPIDM\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1PIDM\u76f8\u6bd4BC\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u57282D\u5bfc\u822a\u548c3D\u6e38\u620f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86PIDM\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u57282D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u793aPIDM\u4ec5\u9700BC 20%-33%\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u57283D\u89c6\u89c9\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8282\u7701\u8d8566%\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "PIDM\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u672c\u8d28\u5728\u4e8e\u53ef\u63a7\u504f\u5dee\u6362\u53d6\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u6761\u4ef6\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Preprint", "summary": "Adam has been at the core of large-scale training for almost a decade, yet a simple empirical fact remains unaccounted for: both validation scores and the qualitative behaviour of the training runs improve when the momentum parameters satisfy $\u03b2_{1}=\u03b2_{2}$. Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \\textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $\u03b2_{1}=\u03b2_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $\u03b2_{1}=\u03b2_{2}$.

In this work, we propose a machine learning framework by opening up a new avenue for addressing this issue: a relational approach. Temporal data from electronic medical records (EMRs) are viewed as multivariate patient logs and represented in a relational data schema. Then, a propositionalisation technique (based on classic aggregation/selection functions from the field of relational data) is applied to construct interpretable features to \"flatten\" the data.

Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons.

We take a geometric view of nonstationary discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by modeling the environment as a differentiable homotopy path and tracking the induced motion of the optimal Bellman fixed point. This yields a length-curvature-kink signature of intrinsic complexity: cumulative drift, acceleration/oscillation, and action-gap-induced nonsmoothness.

However, preference optimization for language models is particularly challenging because token-space similarity does not imply semantic or behavioral similarity. To address this challenge, we leverage latent-space regularization for language model preference optimization. We introduce GANPO, which achieves latent-space regularization by penalizing divergence between the internal representations of a policy model and a reference model. Given that latent representations are not associated with explicit probability densities, we adopt an adversarial approach inspired by GANs to minimize latent-space divergence. We integrate GANPO as a regularizer into existing offline preference optimization objectives. Experiments across multiple model architectures and tasks show consistent improvements from latent-space regularization.

Standard pretraining optimizes a fixed proxy objective (e.g., next-token prediction), which can misallocate compute away from downstream capabilities of interest.

For example, consider self-supervised learning (SSL) with sample augmentation. The V-Pretraining task designer selects pretraining tasks (e.g., augmentations) for which the pretraining loss gradient is aligned with a gradient computed over a downstream task (e.g., image segmentation). This helps steer pretraining towards relevant downstream capabilities. Notably, the pretrained model is never updated on downstream task labels; they are used only to shape the pretraining task. Under matched learner update budgets, V-Pretraining of 0.5B--7B language models improves reasoning (GSM8K test Pass@1) by up to 18% relative over standard next-token prediction using only 12% of GSM8K training examples as feedback.

A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale.

Mahoney"], "title": "PRISM: Distribution-free Adaptive Computation of Matrix Functions for Accelerating Neural Network Training", "comment": null, "summary": "Matrix functions such as square root, inverse roots, and orthogonalization play a central role in preconditioned gradient methods for neural network training. This has motivated the development of iterative algorithms that avoid explicit eigendecompositions and rely primarily on matrix multiplications, making them well suited for modern GPU accelerators. We present PRISM (Polynomial-fitting and Randomized Iterative Sketching for Matrix functions computation), a general framework for accelerating iterative algorithms for computing matrix functions. PRISM combines adaptive polynomial approximation with randomized sketching: at each iteration, it fits a polynomial surrogate to the current spectrum via a sketched least-squares problem, adapting to the instance at hand with minimal overhead. We apply PRISM to accelerate Newton-Schulz-like iterations for matrix square roots and orthogonalization, which are core primitives in machine learning. Unlike prior methods, PRISM requires no explicit spectral bounds or singular value estimates; and it adapts automatically to the evolving spectrum. Empirically, PRISM accelerates training when integrated into Shampoo and Muon optimizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u903c\u8fd1\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u8349\u56fe\u6280\u672f\u52a0\u901f\u77e9\u9635\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eGPU\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Shampoo\u548cMuon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e9\u9635\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u3001\u9006\u6839\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\uff09\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff1b\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u514d\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u9002\u914dGPU\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u8349\u56fe\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u8349\u56fe\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u62df\u5408\u5f53\u524d\u8c31\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u591a\u9879\u5f0f surrogate\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fNewton-Schulz\u7c7b\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "PRISM\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u754c\u6216\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u9002\u914d\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8c31\uff1b\u5728Shampoo\u548cMuon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u540e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u4e3a\u77e9\u9635\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
