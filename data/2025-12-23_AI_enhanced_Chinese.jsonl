For Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (RMLLMs), this is uniquely challenging: intermediate chain-of-thought steps can still leak sensitive information even when final answers are forgotten, and overly aggressive interventions easily damage general reasoning ability. Yet no benchmark jointly evaluates how well unlearning methods suppress reasoning-level leakage while preserving reasoning competence. We address this gap with RMLLMU-Bench, the first benchmark for RMLLM unlearning that extends standard forgetting metrics with dedicated measures of reasoning leakage and reasoning retention. A systematic evaluation on RMLLMU-Bench reveals that existing unlearning methods for MLLMs and Large (Language) Reasoning Models (LRMs) either leave substantial leakage in the reasoning process or severely degrade reasoning performance. To address these gaps, we propose R-MUSE (Reasoning-preserving MLLM Unlearning via Subspace guidance and Adaptive Steering), a training-free and inference-time intervention framework that steers internal representations to forget both answers and reasoning traces while explicitly preserving general reasoning. Experiments on RMLLMU-Bench demonstrate that R-MUSE achieves a substantially better balance between effective forgetting and reasoning retention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RMLLMU-Bench\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08RMLLMs\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4ec5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5e72\u9884\u7684R-MUSE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u6548\u9057\u5fd8\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u597d\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RMLLM\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u7559\uff1b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaRMLLMU-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65b0\u589e\u63a8\u7406\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u7559\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u63d0\u51faR-MUSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u6d88\u9664\u7b54\u6848\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u5f0f\u4fdd\u62a4\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728RMLLMU-Bench\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u7406\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u6216\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff1bR-MUSE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u7559\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "RMLLM\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u9700\u517c\u987e\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u7559\uff1bRMLLMU-Bench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u767d\uff0cR-MUSE\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

A central challenge in this setting is question answering, which requires jointly leveraging unstructured text and the structured relational signals within the graph. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in natural language understanding, their direct use for reasoning over text-attributed graphs remains limited. Retrieval-augmented generation methods that operate purely on text often treat passages as isolated units, ignoring the interconnected structure of the graph. Conversely, graph-based RAG methods that serialize large subgraphs into long textual sequences quickly become infeasible due to LLM context-length constraints, resulting in fragmented reasoning and degraded accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Graph-O1, an agentic GraphRAG framework that enables LLMs to conduct stepwise, interactive reasoning over graphs. Our approach integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with end-to-end reinforcement learning, allowing the model to selectively explore and retrieve only the most informative subgraph components. The reasoning procedure is framed as a multi-turn interaction between the agent and the graph environment, and the agent is trained through a unified reward mechanism.

Q-KVComm combines three key innovations: (1) adaptive layer-wise quantization that allocates variable bit-widths based on sensitivity profiling, (2) hybrid information extraction that preserves critical facts across content domains, and (3) heterogeneous model calibration establishing cross-architecture communication. Extensive experiments across three diverse question-answering datasets demonstrate that Q-KVComm achieves 5-6x compression ratios while maintaining semantic fidelity, with coherence quality scores above 0.77 across all scenarios.

While recent advances in 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate approximations of scene geometry and appearance, these methods often fall short in relighting scenarios due to the lack of precise, spatially varying material parameters. At the same time, diffusion models operating on 2D images have shown strong performance in predicting physically based rendering (PBR) properties such as albedo, roughness, and metallicity. However, transferring these 2D material maps onto reconstructed 3D geometry remains a significant challenge. We propose a framework for fusing 2D material data into 3D geometry using a combination of novel learning-based and projection-based approaches. We begin by reconstructing scene geometry via Gaussian Splatting. From the input images, a diffusion model generates 2D maps for albedo, roughness, and metallic parameters. Any existing diffusion model that can convert images or videos to PBR materials can be applied. The predictions are further integrated into the 3D representation either by optimizing an image-based loss or by directly projecting the material parameters onto the Gaussians using Gaussian ray tracing. To enhance fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency, we further introduce a light-weight neural refinement step (Neural Merger), which takes ray-traced material features as input and produces detailed adjustments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques in both quantitative metrics and perceived visual realism. This enables more accurate, relightable, and photorealistic renderings from reconstructed scenes, significantly improving the realism and efficiency of asset creation workflows in content production pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c062D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684PBR\u6750\u8d28\u56fe\uff08\u5982\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u3001\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u5ea6\uff09\u878d\u5408\u52303D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u7cbe\u4fee\u6a21\u5757\uff08Neural Merger\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6750\u8d28\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u6750\u8d28\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\uff1b\u800c2D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210PBR\u6750\u8d28\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6620\u5c04\u52303D\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGaussian Splatting\u91cd\u5efa\u51e0\u4f55\uff1b\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u62102D PBR\u6750\u8d28\u56fe\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6295\u5f71\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u5c062D\u6750\u8d28\u878d\u5408\u81f33D\u9ad8\u65af\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u7cbe\u4fee\u6a21\u5757\uff08Neural Merger\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3001\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548 bridged 2D\u6750\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e3D\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u4ea7\u7ba1\u7ebf\u4e2d\u8d44\u4ea7\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Since too much congestion of pedestrian flows can cause serious accidents, mathematically modeling and predicting pedestrian behaviors is important for preventing such accidents and providing a safe and comfortable environment. Although numerous studies have investigated learning-based modeling methods, most of them focus only on the local behavior of pedestrians, such as collision avoidance with neighbors and environmental objects. In an actual environment, pedestrian behavior involves more complicated decision making including global route selection. Moreover, a state transition from stopping to walking at a traffic light should be considered simultaneously. In this study, the proposed model integrates local behaviors with global route selection, using an Attention mechanism to ensure consistent global and local behavior predictions. We recorded video data of pedestrians at Shibuya scramble crossing and trained the proposed model using pedestrian walking trajectory data obtained from the video. Simulations of pedestrian behaviors based on the trained model qualitatively and quantitatively validated that the proposed model can appropriately predict pedestrian behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u907f\u969c\u7b49\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e1c\u4eac\u6da9\u8c37\u5341\u5b57\u8def\u53e3\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u90e8\u907f\u969c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u8fd8\u6d89\u53ca\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u53ca\u7ea2\u7eff\u706f\u542f\u505c\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u9884\u9632\u62e5\u5835\u4e8b\u6545\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5171\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u8212\u9002\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u907f\u969c\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Attention\u673a\u5236\u534f\u8c03\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6da9\u8c37 scramble crossing \u5b9e\u9645\u89c6\u9891\u63d0\u53d6\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5c42\u9762\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u884c\u4eba\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing vision-language models (VLMs) typically align titles with primary images, i.e., single-view, but overlook non-primary images and auxiliary textual views that provide critical semantics in open marketplaces such as Etsy or Poshmark. To this end, we propose a framework that unifies multimodal and multi-view learning through Factorized Transport, a lightweight approximation of optimal transport, designed for scalability and deployment efficiency. During training, the method emphasizes primary views while stochastically sampling auxiliary ones, reducing training cost from quadratic in the number of views to constant per item. At inference, all views are fused into a single cached embedding, preserving the efficiency of two-tower retrieval with no additional online overhead. On an industrial dataset of 1M product listings and 0.3M interactions, our approach delivers consistent improvements in cross-view and query-to-item retrieval, achieving up to +7.9% Recall@500 over strong multimodal baselines.

However, most existing DEA-powered soft robots require high voltages and wired power connections, limiting their ability to operate in confined environments. This study presents an untethered thin soft robot (UTS-Robot) powered by thin dielectric elastomer actuators (TS-DEA). The robot measures 38 mm in length, 6 mm in height, and weighs just 2.34 grams, integrating flexible onboard electronics to achieve fully untethered actuation. The TS-DEA, operating at resonant frequencies of 86 Hz under a low driving voltage of 220 V, adopts a dual-actuation sandwiched structure, comprising four dielectric elastomer layers bonded to a compressible tensioning mechanism at its core. This design enables high power density actuation and locomotion via three directional friction pads. The low-voltage actuation is achieved by fabricating each elastomer layer via spin coating to an initial thickness of 50 um, followed by biaxial stretching to 8 um. A comprehensive design and modelling framework has been developed to optimise TS-DEA performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the bare TS-DEA achieves a locomotion speed of 12.36 mm/s at resonance, the untethered configuration achieves a locomotion speed of 0.5 mm/s, making it highly suitable for navigating confined and complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7531\u8d85\u8584\u4ecb\u7535\u5f39\u6027\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\uff08TS-DEA\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u7f06\u8584\u578b\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08UTS-Robot\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4f4e\u7535\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\uff08220 V\uff09\u3001\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u72ed\u7a84\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ecb\u7535\u5f39\u6027\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7535\u538b\u548c\u6709\u7ebf\u4f9b\u7535\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5bc6\u95ed\u72ed\u5c0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5236\u5907\u4e86\u56db\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684TS-DEA\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65cb\u6d82+\u53cc\u8f74\u62c9\u4f38\u5de5\u827a\u5c06\u5f39\u6027\u4f53\u5c42\u51cf\u8584\u81f38 \u03bcm\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u67d4\u6027\u677f\u8f7d\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u7f06\u9a71\u52a8\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u632f\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u4e09\u5411\u6469\u64e6\u57ab\u534f\u540c\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "TS-DEA\u572886 Hz\u5171\u632f\u9891\u7387\u3001220 V\u9a71\u52a8\u7535\u538b\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1b\u88f8\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe12.36 mm/s\uff0c\u6574\u673aUTS-Robot\u8fbe0.5 mm/s\uff1b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e3a38 mm\u00d76 mm\uff0c\u91cd\u91cf\u4ec52.34 g\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u7535\u538b\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u5168\u65e0\u7f06\u7684\u4ecb\u7535\u5f39\u6027\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Accurate prediction of LC mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities. Although traditional regression-based models have been commonly used, explainable machine learning models may offer enhanced predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the factors influencing LC mortality. This study applied three models: random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and linear regression (LR) to predict county-level LC mortality rates across the United States. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to determine variable importance and their directional impact. Geographic disparities in LC mortality were analyzed through Getis-Ord (Gi*) hotspot analysis. The RF model outperformed both GBR and LR, achieving an R2 value of 41.9% and an RMSE of 12.8. SHAP analysis identified smoking rate as the most important predictor, followed by median home value and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population.

The facility layout problem is modeled as a combinatorial assignment problem with dense logical structure arising from adjacency, separation, and slot-availability constraints. We develop a CNF-based formulation for layout feasibility and compare CDCL-based SAT solving against CP-SAT and MILP formulations under a unified benchmarking framework. Empirical results show that CDCL exhibits near-constant runtime behavior for feasibility detection across increasing problem sizes and constraint densities, while CP-SAT and MILP display polynomial and exponential scaling respectively. To address the limitation of CDCL in objective optimization, we introduce two hybrid architectures that combine CDCL-based feasibility search with CP-SAT optimization. The first architecture rapidly enumerates feasible layouts to trade optimality for speed, while the second uses CDCL to generate warm-start solutions that accelerate exact optimization. The results demonstrate that hybrid approaches can significantly reduce time-to-solution while preserving correctness guarantees, clarifying the algorithmic trade-offs between clause-learning search and exact optimization methods in large-scale discrete layout problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c06CDCL\uff08\u51b2\u7a81\u9a71\u52a8\u5b50\u53e5\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e0eVSIDS\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u8bbe\u65bd\u5e03\u5c40\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eCNF\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408CDCL\u4e0eCP-SAT\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u65bd\u5e03\u5c40\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u5bc6\u96c6\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfCP-SAT\u548cMILP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u7ea6\u675f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eCNF\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4CDCL-SAT\u3001CP-SAT\u548cMILP\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cdCDCL\u4e0eCP-SAT\u534f\u540c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5feb\u901f\u679a\u4e3e\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u4ee5CDCL\u751f\u6210warm-start\u89e3\u52a0\u901f\u7cbe\u786e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "CDCL\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e38\u6570\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eCP-SAT\uff08\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff09\u548cMILP\uff08\u6307\u6570\uff09\uff1b\u4e24\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "CDCL\u64c5\u957f\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u5bc6\u96c6\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0eCP-SAT\u534f\u540c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u79bb\u6563\u5e03\u5c40\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

We evaluate two families of approaches for ticket prioritization: embedding-based pipelines that combine dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classical classifiers, and a fine-tuned multilingual transformer that processes both textual and numerical features. Embedding-based methods exhibit limited generalization across a wide range of thirty configurations, with clustering failing to uncover meaningful structures and supervised models highly sensitive to embedding quality. In contrast, the proposed transformer model achieves substantially higher performance, with an average F1-score of 78.5% and weighted Cohen's kappa values of nearly 0.80, indicating strong alignment with true labels.

We introduce an adaptive accountability framework that (i) continuously traces responsibility flows through a lifecycle-aware audit ledger, (ii) detects harmful emergent norms online via decentralized sequential hypothesis tests, and (iii) deploys local policy and reward-shaping interventions that realign agents with system-level objectives in near real time. We prove a bounded-compromise theorem showing that whenever the expected intervention cost exceeds an adversary's payoff, the long-run proportion of compromised interactions is bounded by a constant strictly less than one. Extensive high-performance simulations with up to 100 heterogeneous agents, partial observability, and stochastic communication graphs show that our framework prevents collusion and resource hoarding in at least 90% of configurations, boosts average collective reward by 12-18%, and lowers the Gini inequality index by up to 33% relative to a PPO baseline.

We present a practical multimodal framework for frame-accurate human-robot interaction intent detection that fuses camera-invariant 2D skeletal pose and facial emotion features extracted from monocular RGB video. Unlike prior methods requiring RGB-D sensors or GPU acceleration, our approach resource-constrained embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi 5, CPU-only). To address the severe class imbalance in natural human-robot interaction datasets, we introduce a novel approach to synthesize temporally coherent pose-emotion-label sequences for data re-balancing called MINT-RVAE (Multimodal Recurrent Variational Autoencoder for Intent Sequence Generation). Comprehensive offline evaluations under cross-subject and cross-scene protocols demonstrate strong generalization performance, achieving frame- and sequence-level AUROC of 0.95. Crucially, we validate real-world generalization through cross-camera evaluation on the MIRA robot head, which employs a different onboard RGB sensor and operates in uncontrolled environments not represented in the training data. Despite this domain shift, the deployed system achieves 91% accuracy and 100% recall across 32 live interaction trials.

Monotonicity constraints align model behavior with domain knowledge, but their performance cost - the price of monotonicity - is not well quantified. This paper benchmarks monotone-constrained versus unconstrained gradient boosting models for credit probability of default across five public datasets and three libraries. We define the Price of Monotonicity (PoM) as the relative change in standard performance metrics when moving from unconstrained to constrained models, estimated via paired comparisons with bootstrap uncertainty. In our experiments, PoM in AUC ranges from essentially zero to about 2.9 percent: constraints are almost costless on large datasets (typically less than 0.2 percent, often indistinguishable from zero) and most costly on smaller datasets with extensive constraint coverage (around 2-3 percent). Thus, appropriately specified monotonicity constraints can often deliver interpretability with small accuracy losses, particularly in large-scale credit portfolios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e93\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5355\u8c03\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff08\u5373\u2018\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\u2019PoM\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728AUC\u4e0a\u7684\u635f\u5931\u901a\u5e38\u5f88\u5c0f\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5355\u8c03\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u673a \u6784\u5728\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u867d\u7b26\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u4ef7\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5e93\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355\u8c03\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u2018\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\u2019\uff08PoM\uff09\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982AUC\uff09\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u524d\u540e\u76f8\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0eBootstrap\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "PoM\u5728AUC\u4e0a\u4ecb\u4e8e0\u5230\u7ea62.9%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff1a\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u901a\u5e38\u5c0f\u4e8e0.2%\uff0c\u5e38\u4e0e\u96f6\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e14\u7ea6\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u65f6\u8fbe2\u20133%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6070\u5f53\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4fe1\u8d37\u7ec4\u5408\u3002"}}

While algorithms such as Network Dissection and CLIP-Dissect achieve great empirical success, a rigorous theoretical foundation remains absent, which is crucial to enable trustworthy and reliable explanations. In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the inverse process of machine learning, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) Faithfulness: whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) Stability: whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with BE (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u548cBootstrap\u89e3\u91ca\uff08BE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6982\u5ff5\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Network Dissection\u3001CLIP-Dissect\uff09\u867d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u8c28\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u53ef\u4fe1\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9006\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001AUROC\u3001IoU\uff09\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51faBootstrap\u96c6\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0eBE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u53ef\u4fe1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Traditional KV cache compression methods typically involve permanently evicting or irreversibly merging \"less important\" tokens with low attention scores. This approach results in the unrecoverable loss of token information, which we call Contextual Amnesia, significantly degrading the model's information retrieval capability. To address this issue, we propose KVReviver, a reversible KV cache compression method based on the sketch algorithm. This method allows reconstructing compressed tokens from an additional data structure, thus enabling full-scale computation within limited memory. Experiments showed that in 2k-length contexts, it requires only 10% of KV Cache budget while maintaining identical end-to-end inference accuracy.

In this paper, we introduce a training- and inference-light, interpretable method for representing and transferring artistic style. Our approach leverages an art-specific Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on top of latent embeddings of generative image models. Trained on artistic data, our SAE learns an emergent, largely disentangled set of stylistic and compositional concepts, corresponding to style-related elements pertaining brushwork, texture, and color palette, as well as semantic and structural concepts. We call it LouvreSAE and use it to construct style profiles: compact, decomposable steering vectors that enable style transfer without any model updates or optimization. Unlike prior concept-based style transfer methods, our method requires no fine-tuning, no LoRA training, and no additional inference passes, enabling direct steering of artistic styles from only a few reference images.

Symbolic world models help by decomposing tasks into discrete predicates that capture object properties and relations. Existing methods learn predicates either top-down, by prompting foundation models without data grounding, or bottom-up, from demonstrations without high-level priors. We introduce UniPred, a bilevel learning framework that unifies both. UniPred uses large language models (LLMs) to propose predicate effect distributions that supervise neural predicate learning from low-level data, while learned feedback iteratively refines the LLM hypotheses. Leveraging strong visual foundation model features, UniPred learns robust predicate classifiers in cluttered scenes. We further propose a predicate evaluation method that supports symbolic models beyond STRIPS assumptions. Across five simulated and one real-robot domains, UniPred achieves 2-4 times higher success rates than top-down methods and 3-4 times faster learning than bottom-up approaches, advancing scalable and flexible symbolic world modeling for robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUniPred\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u8c13\u8bcd\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7b26\u53f7\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u56e0\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u7a00\u758f\u800c\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u8c13\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u2019\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6491\u6216\u2018\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u2019\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u5c42\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6UniPred\uff1aLLM\u751f\u6210\u8c13\u8bcd\u6548\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u76d1\u7763\u795e\u7ecf\u8c13\u8bcd\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u9988\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316LLM\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u5347\u8c13\u8bcd\u5206\u7c7b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u8d8aSTRIPS\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u8c13\u8bcd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cUniPred\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6bd4\u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad82\u20134\u500d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb3\u20134\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "UniPred\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b26\u53f7\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

We propose SuperFlow, an RL training framework for flow-based models that adjusts group sizes with variance-aware sampling and computes step-level advantages in a way that is consistent with continuous-time flow dynamics.

This neural operator was demonstrated to outperform for certain cases some baseline models such as DeepONet, Fourier neural operator, and Galerkin transformer in terms of surrogate accuracy. The convolutional neural operator, however, seems not to be validated for few-shot learning. We extend the model to few-shot learning scenarios by first pre-training a convolutional neural operator using a source dataset and then adjusting the parameters of the trained neural operator using only a small target dataset. We investigate three strategies for adjusting the parameters of a trained neural operator, including fine-tuning, low-rank adaption, and neuron linear transformation, and find that the neuron linear transformation strategy enjoys the highest surrogate accuracy in solving PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Brusselator diffusion-reaction system, and Navier-Stokes equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u63d0\u5347PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5728\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u5728Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001Brusselator\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cNavier-Stokes\u65b9\u7a0b\u7b49PDE\u6c42\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u9002\u914d\u5c11\u6837\u672cPDE\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Yet most existing LLM-based MAS either adopt fully connected graphs, simple sparse rings, or ad-hoc dynamic selection, with little structural guidance. In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c\uff08SW\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u501f\u9274\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u660eSW\u62d3\u6251\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5171\u8bc6\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u8fde\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684MAS\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u7b80\u5355\u73af\u6216\u968f\u610f\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u53d7\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3aMAS\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c\u7f51\u7edc\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08MAD\uff09\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u71b5\u7b49\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u91cd\u8fde\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684SW\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "SW\u62d3\u6251\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548ctoken\u6d88\u8017\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5171\u8bc6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91cd\u8fde\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aMAS\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u652f\u6301\u6d8c\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce the Compression-Decay Comprehension Test (CDCT), a benchmark that independently measures constraint compliance (CC) and semantic accuracy (SA) across compression levels. We evaluate 9 frontier LLMs across 8 concepts using 5 compression levels from extreme (c=0.0, ~2 words) to none (c=1.0, ~135 words). A three-judge LLM jury achieves almost perfect inter-rater agreement on CC (Fleiss' \\k{appa}=0.90).\n  We observe a universal U-curve pattern in constraint compliance (97.2% prevalence), with violations peaking at medium compression (c=0.5, ~27 words). Counterintuitively, models perform better at extreme compression than medium lengths. The dimensions are statistically orthogonal (r=0.193, p=0.084), with constraint effects 2.9x larger than semantic effects.\n  Experimental validation via RLHF ablation confirms our constraint salience hypothesis: removing \"helpfulness\" signals improves CC by 598% on average (71/72 trials, p<0.001), with 79% achieving perfect compliance. This demonstrates that RLHF-trained helpfulness behaviors are the dominant cause of constraint violations at medium compression.

However, reliance on expensive real-world data limits progress. Simulators offer cost-effective alternatives, but the gap between simulation and reality challenges effective policy transfer. This paper introduces TwinAligner, a novel Real2Sim2Real system that addresses both visual and dynamic gaps. The visual alignment module achieves pixel-level alignment through SDF reconstruction and editable 3DGS rendering, while the dynamic alignment module ensures dynamic consistency by identifying rigid physics from robot-object interaction. TwinAligner improves robot learning by providing scalable data collection and establishing a trustworthy iterative cycle, accelerating algorithm development. Quantitative evaluations highlight TwinAligner's strong capabilities in visual and dynamic real-to-sim alignment.

Our experiments verify SEATER's strong performance, but show that its tree construction step during training becomes a major bottleneck as the number of items grows. To address this, we implement and evaluate two alternative construction algorithms: a greedy method optimized for minimal build time, and a hybrid method that combines greedy clustering at high levels with more precise grouping at lower levels. The greedy method reduces tree construction time to less than 2% of the original with only a minor drop in quality on the dataset with the largest item collection.

However, they typically mimic expert trajectories without predictive motion reasoning, which limits their ability to reason about what actions to take. To address this limitation, we propose joint learning with motion image diffusion, a novel strategy that enhances VLA models with motion reasoning capabilities. Our method extends the VLA architecture with a dual-head design: while the action head predicts action chunks as in vanilla VLAs, an additional motion head, implemented as a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), predicts optical-flow-based motion images that capture future dynamics. The two heads are trained jointly, enabling the shared VLM backbone to learn representations that couple robot control with motion knowledge. This joint learning builds temporally coherent and physically grounded representations without modifying the inference pathway of standard VLAs, thereby maintaining test-time latency. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that joint learning with motion image diffusion improves the success rate of pi-series VLAs to 97.5% on the LIBERO benchmark and 58.0% on the RoboTwin benchmark, yielding a 23% improvement in real-world performance and validating its effectiveness in enhancing the motion reasoning capability of large-scale VLAs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5934\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934+\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5934\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u6a21\u4eff\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5934VLA\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u6cbf\u7528\u539f\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u65b0\u589e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5934\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Diffusion Transformer\uff08DiT\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5e72\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe97.5%\uff0cRoboTwin\u57fa\u51c6\u8fbe58.0%\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534723%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Codebook-based methods extend this trend by achieving strong accuracy in the extremely low-bit regime (e.g., 2-bit). However, current kernels rely on dequantization, which repeatedly fetches centroids and reconstructs weights, incurring substantial latency and cache pressure. We present CodeGEMM, a codebook-centric GEMM kernel that replaces dequantization with precomputed inner products between centroids and activations stored in a lightweight Psumbook. At inference, code indices directly gather these partial sums, eliminating per-element lookups and reducing the on-chip footprint. The kernel supports the systematic exploration of latency-memory-accuracy trade-offs under a unified implementation.

Although the framework underperforms on standard evaluation metrics compared to supervised and proprietary models, it provides valuable insights into the challenges of applying RL to legal texts. These challenges include reward model alignment, legal language complexity, and domain-specific adaptation. Through empirical and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how RL can be repurposed for high-stakes, long-document tasks in law.

To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faReal2Edit2Real\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e2D\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\u76843D\u7f16\u8f91\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0810\u201350\u500d\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u793a\u8303\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u6784\u5efa\u5ea6\u91cf\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\u76843D\u7f16\u8f91\u5e76\u51e0\u4f55\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f4d\u59ff\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4e3b\u63a7\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u8f85\u4ee5\u52a8\u4f5c/\u8fb9\u7f18/\u5149\u7ebf\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u75281\u20135\u4e2a\u6e90\u793a\u8303\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f7f\u752850\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u793a\u8303\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534710\u201350\u500d\uff1b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Real2Edit2Real\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u793a\u8303\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

However, existing RAG-based recommenders face two critical challenges: (1) vulnerability to distribution shifts across different environments (e.g., time periods, user segments), leading to performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, and (2) lack of faithful explanations that can be verified against retrieved evidence. In this paper, we propose CIRR, a Causal-Invariant Retrieval-Augmented Recommendation framework that addresses both challenges simultaneously. CIRR learns environment-invariant user preference representations through causal inference, which guide a debiased retrieval process to select relevant evidence from multiple sources. Furthermore, we introduce consistency constraints that enforce faithfulness between retrieved evidence, generated explanations, and recommendation outputs. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CIRR achieves robust performance under distribution shifts, reducing performance degradation from 15.4% (baseline) to only 5.6% in OOD scenarios, while providing more faithful and interpretable explanations (26% improvement in faithfulness score) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCIRR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347RAG\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "CIRR\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u53bb\u504f\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCIRR\u5c06OOD\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4ece15.4%\u964d\u81f35.6%\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u63d0\u534726%\u3002", "conclusion": "CIRR\u6709\u6548\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56RAG\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong generalization, current benchmarks provide limited understanding of how embodiment -- i.e., the choice of physical platform, sensor configuration, and modality alignment -- influences perception, reasoning, and control. We introduce Embodied4C, a closed-loop benchmark designed as a Turing test for embodied reasoning. The benchmark evaluates the core embodied capabilities of VLMs across three heterogeneous embodiments -- autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, and robotic manipulators -- through approximately 1.1K one-shot reasoning questions and 58 goal-directed navigation tasks. These tasks jointly assess four foundational dimensions: semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical reasoning. Each embodiment presents dynamic sensor configurations and environment variations to probe generalization beyond platform-specific adaptation. To prevent embodiment overfitting, Embodied4C integrates domain-far queries targeting abstract and cross-context reasoning. Comprehensive evaluation across ten state-of-the-art VLMs and four embodied control baselines shows that cross-modal alignment and instruction tuning matter more than scale, while spatial and temporal reasoning remains the primary bottleneck for reliable embodied competence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Embodied4C\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u8f7d\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u3001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3001\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u5177\u8eab\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u53f0\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30VLMs\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5177\u8eab\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u95ed\u5408\u73af\u8def\u57fa\u51c6Embodied4C\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u79cd\u5f02\u6784\u5177\u8eab\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea61.1K\u4e2a\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u548c58\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7269\u7406\u56db\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8fdc\u57df\u67e5\u8be2\u9632\u6b62\u5177\u8eab\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff1b\u572810\u4e2aSOTA VLMs\u548c4\u4e2a\u5177\u8eab\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u662f\u5236\u7ea6\u53ef\u9760\u5177\u8eab\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "Embodied4C\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dVLMs\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Supervised contrastive approaches based on the InfoNCE loss suffer from negative-sample dilution and lack adaptive decision boundaries, thereby reducing discriminative power in fine-grained recognition tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCS-SupCon). Our framework introduces a sigmoid-based pairwise contrastive loss with learnable temperature and bias parameters to enable adaptive decision boundaries. This formulation emphasizes hard negatives, mitigates negative-sample dilution, and more effectively exploits supervision. In addition, an explicit style-distance constraint further disentangles style and content representations, leading to more robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, including CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dogs, demonstrate that SCS-SupCon achieves state-of-the-art performance across both CNN and Transformer backbones.

While recent advances in self-supervised learning and transformer-based architectures have significantly improved HAR performance, adapting large pretrained models to new domains remains a practical challenge due to limited computational resources on target devices. This papers investigates parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized LoRA, as scalable alternatives to full model fine-tuning for HAR. We propose an adaptation framework built upon a Masked Autoencoder backbone and evaluate its performance under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out validation protocol across five open HAR datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that both LoRA and QLoRA can match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time. Further analyses reveal that LoRA maintains robust performance even under limited supervision and that the adapter rank provides a controllable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. QLoRA extends these benefits by reducing the memory footprint of frozen weights through quantization, with minimal impact on classification quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08MAE\uff09\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08LoRA/QLoRA\uff09\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff08HAR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u65b0\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMasked Autoencoder\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u548cQuantized LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00HAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528Leave-One-Dataset-Out\u534f\u8bae\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LoRA\u4e0eQLoRA\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff1bLoRA\u5728\u4f4e\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u4ecd\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u79e9\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff1bQLoRA\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u635f\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRA\u4e0eQLoRA\u662f\u9762\u5411\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907HAR\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This work introduces the interactive Swarm Leader Identification (iSLI) problem, a novel approach where an adversarial probing agent identifies a swarm's leader by physically interacting with its members. We formulate the iSLI problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employ Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train the prober's policy. The proposed approach utilizes a novel neural network architecture featuring a Timed Graph Relationformer (TGR) layer combined with a Simplified Structured State Space Sequence (S5) model. The TGR layer effectively processes graph-based observations of the swarm, capturing temporal dependencies and fusing relational information using a learned gating mechanism to generate informative representations for policy learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our TGR-based model outperforms baseline graph neural network architectures and exhibits significant zero-shot generalization capabilities across varying swarm sizes and speeds different from those used during training. The trained prober achieves high accuracy in identifying the leader, maintaining performance even in out-of-training distribution scenarios, and showing appropriate confidence levels in its predictions. Real-world experiments with physical robots further validate the approach, confirming successful sim-to-real transfer and robustness to dynamic changes, such as unexpected agent disconnections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8702\u7fa4\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\uff08iSLI\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u8702\u7fa4\u6210\u5458\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\uff1b\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aPOMDP\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTimed Graph Relationformer\uff08TGR\uff09\u4e0eS5\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53casim-to-real\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8702\u7fa4\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u9690\u853d\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u85cf\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06iSLI\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08POMDP\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408Timed Graph Relationformer\uff08TGR\uff09\u5c42\u4e0e\u7b80\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff08S5\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dTGR\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u8702\u7fa4\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u8702\u7fa4\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86sim-to-real\u8fc1\u79fb\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982\u8282\u70b9\u65ad\u8fde\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0iSLI\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176TGR-S5-PPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8702\u7fa4\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While Generative AI has shown promise in translating designs to code, current solutions often produce monolithic scripts, failing to natively support modern ecosystems like React, Vue, or Angular. Furthermore, the generated code frequently suffers from poor modularity, making it difficult to maintain. To bridge this gap, we introduce Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS), a hierarchical framework that merges visual understanding with structural normalization. Initially, a visual-semantic encoder maps the screen capture into a serialized tree topology, capturing the essential layout hierarchy. Instead of simple parsing, we apply heuristic deduplication and pattern recognition to isolate reusable blocks, creating a framework-agnostic schema. Finally, a constraint-based generation protocol guides the LLM to synthesize production-ready code with strict typing and component props.

However, current SARs provide only limited, passive touch-based interactions and lack the rich haptic cues, such as warmth, heartbeat or purring, that are characteristic of human-animal touch. This limits their ability to evoke emotionally engaging, life-like physical interactions.\n  We present a multimodal tactile prototype, which was used to augment the established PARO robot, integrating thermal and vibrotactile feedback to simulate feeling biophysiological signals.

Traditional approaches for this task often struggle with the complex instance shapes and occlusions inherent in indoor environments. They frequently overshoot by attempting to predict 3D shapes directly from incomplete 2D images, which results in limited reconstruction quality. We aim to overcome this limitation by splitting the process into two steps: first, we employ diffusion-based techniques to predict the complete views of the room background and occluded indoor instances, then transform them into 3D. Our modular framework makes contributions to this field through the following components: an amodal completion module for restoring the full view of occluded instances, an inpainting model specifically trained to predict room layouts, a hybrid depth estimation technique that balances overall geometric accuracy with fine detail expressiveness, and a view-space alignment method that exploits both 2D and 3D cues to ensure precise placement of instances within the scene. This approach effectively reconstructs both foreground instances and the room background from a single image. Extensive experiments on the 3D-Front dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of both visual quality and reconstruction accuracy. The framework holds promising potential for applications in interior design, real estate, and augmented reality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6b65\u5b8c\u6210\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u4e0e3D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u89c6\u56fe\u5ba4\u51853D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4e0d\u5b8c\u65742D\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b3D\u5f62\u72b6\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u623f\u95f4\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5168\u89c6\u89d2\u8865\u5168\uff08\u542bamodal\u8865\u5168\u3001\u5e03\u5c40inpainting\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u89c6\u56fe\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a3D\u3002", "result": "\u57283D-Front\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u56fe\u5ba4\u5185\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u906e\u6321\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u548cAR\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose HINT, a Hybrid INductive-Transductive Network, and an INDU-TRANSDUCTIVE training strategy that treats speed as a transductive, network-wide signal while learning flow inductively to generalize to unseen locations. HINT couples (i) an inductive spatial transformer that learns similarity-driven, long-range interactions from node features with (ii) a diffusion GCN conditioned by FiLM on rich static context (OSM-derived attributes and traffic simulation), and (iii) a node-wise calibration layer that corrects scale biases per segment. Training uses masked reconstruction with epoch-wise node sampling, hard-node mining to emphasize difficult sensors, and noise injection on visible flows to prevent identity mapping, while graph structure is built from driving distances.\n  Across three real-world datasets, MOW (Antwerp, Belgium), UTD19-Torino, and UTD19-Essen, HINT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inductive baselines. Relative to KITS, HINT reduces MAE on MOW by $\\approx42$% with basic simulation and $\\approx50$% with calibrated simulation; on Torino by $\\approx22$%, and on Essen by $\\approx12$%. Even without simulation, HINT remains superior on MOW and Torino, while simulation is crucial on Essen.

We introduce Propose, Solve, Verify (PSV) a simple self-play framework where formal verification signals are used to create a proposer capable of generating challenging synthetic problems and a solver trained via expert iteration. We use PSV to train PSV-Verus, which across three benchmarks improves pass@1 by up to 9.6x over inference-only and expert-iteration baselines. We show that performance scales with the number of generated questions and training iterations, and through ablations identify formal verification and difficulty-aware proposal as essential ingredients for successful self-play.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPropose, Solve, Verify (PSV)\u7684\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578bPSV-Verus\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347pass@1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8106\u5f31\u4e14\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u800c\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff1b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPSV\uff08Propose, Solve, Verify\uff09\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u2018\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u2019\uff08Proposer\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fed\u4ee3\uff08expert iteration\uff09\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u2018\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u2019\uff08Solver\uff09\uff1b\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "PSV-Verus\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2dpass@1\u6307\u6807\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe9.6\u500d\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fed\u4ee3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u8bae\u662f\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ecf\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PSV\uff09\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Standard Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), with its focus on conciseness, fails to preserve narrative flow. This paper formally defines this challenge as a new NLP task: Narrative Consolidation, where the central objectives are chronological integrity, completeness, and the fusion of complementary details. To demonstrate the critical role of temporal structure in this task, we introduce Temporal Alignment Event Graph (TAEG), a graph structure that explicitly models chronology and event alignment. By applying a standard centrality algorithm to TAEG, our method functions as a version selection mechanism, choosing the most central representation of each event in its correct temporal position. In a study on the four Biblical Gospels, this structure-focused approach guarantees perfect temporal ordering (Kendall's Tau of 1.000) by design and dramatically improves content metrics (e.g., +357.2% in ROUGE-L F1). The success of this baseline method validates the formulation of Narrative Consolidation as a relevant task and establishes that an explicit temporal backbone is a fundamental component for its resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u2014\u2014\u53d9\u4e8b\u6574\u5408\uff08Narrative Consolidation\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u6587\u6863\uff08\u5982\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bc1\u8bcd\u6216\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u8f7d\uff09\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6587\u6863\u6458\u8981\u5f3a\u8c03\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\uff08TAEG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7248\u672c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff08Kendall's Tau=1.000\uff09\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\uff08ROUGE-L F1\u63d0\u5347357.2%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u591a\u6587\u6863\u6458\u8981\uff08MDS\uff09\u4ee5\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u53e0\u53d9\u4e8b\u6587\u6863\uff08\u5982\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bc1\u8bcd\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u8f7d\uff09\u7684\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d9\u4e8b\u6574\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u56fe\uff08TAEG\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728TAEG\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7248\u672c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5404\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7f6e\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u798f\u97f3\u4e66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u786e\uff08Kendall's Tau=1.000\uff09\uff0cROUGE-L F1\u63d0\u5347357.2%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TAEG\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d9\u4e8b\u6574\u5408\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fc5\u8981\u4e14\u72ec\u7acb\u7684NLP\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982TAEG\uff09\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8981\u7d20\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels. However, most existing methods rely on centralized monitoring of aggregated predictions, overlooking site-specific drift dynamics. We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification.

We present Stochastic Latent Matching (STHLM), a generative vector search method that samples query-conditioned embeddings from text or image inputs to enhance retrieval performance. Analogous to how Chain-of-Thought reasoning enables language models to \"think longer\" on complex problems, STHLM allows retrieval systems to \"search wider\" through iterative sampling. STHLM demonstrates critical improvements over classical vector retrieval across diverse benchmarks, including scientific literature, clinical notes, and tissue images, boosting retrieval performance by 10-30% through test-time compute (trading latency for accuracy), while enabling up to a 10-fold compression of embedding dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6f5c\u5728\u5339\u914d\uff08STHLM\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5411\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff09\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u534710-30%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad810\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u67e5\u8be2\uff08\u5982\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u62a5\u544a\uff09\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff1b\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u6f5c\u5728\u5339\u914d\uff08STHLM\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5411\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u2018\u66f4\u5e7f\u641c\u7d22\u2019\uff1b\u7c7b\u6bd4\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56fe\u50cf\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSTHLM\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u534710\u201330%\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad810\u500d\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "STHLM\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Many existing robotic neurosurgical tools are designed using stainless steel or nitinol materials. Using polymer-based materials instead can offer advantages such as reduced interference in magnetic resonance imaging, enhanced safety for guiding electrically powered instruments, and reduced tissue damage due to inherent compliance. Several polymer materials have been used in robotic surgical applications, such as polyimide, polycarbonate, and elastic resin. Various fabrication strategies have also been proposed, including standard microfabrication techniques, thermal drawing, and 3-D printing. In our previous work, a tendon-driven, notched-tube was designed for several neurosurgical robotic tools, utilizing laser micromachining to reduce the stiffness of the tube in certain directions. This fabrication method is desirable because it has a single-step process, has high precision, and does not require a cleanroom or harsh chemicals. Past studies have explored laser-micromachining of polymer material for surgical applications such as stent fabrication. In this work, we explore extending the use of the laser micromachining approach to the fabrication of polyimide (PI) robotically steerable cannulas for neurosurgical applications. Utilizing the method presented in this work, we fabricated joints as small as 1.5 mm outer diameter (OD). Multiple joints were fabricated using PI tubes of different ODs, and the loading behavior of the fabricated joints was experimentally characterized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6fc0\u5149\u5fae\u52a0\u5de5\u6280\u672f\u5236\u9020\u805a\u9170\u4e9a\u80fa\uff08PI\uff09\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u5957\u7ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5916\u5f84\u4f4e\u81f31.5 mm\u7684\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5bf8PI\u7ba1\u5236\u6210\u7684\u5173\u8282\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5de5\u5177\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u6216\u954d\u949b\u5408\u91d1\uff0c\u800c\u805a\u5408\u7269\u6750\u6599\uff08\u5982\u805a\u9170\u4e9a\u80fa\uff09\u53ef\u964d\u4f4eMRI\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u68b0\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7ec4\u7ec7\u635f\u4f24\uff1b\u6fc0\u5149\u5fae\u52a0\u5de5\u5177\u5907\u5355\u6b65\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6d01\u51c0\u5ba4\u548c\u8150\u8680\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3PI\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u5957\u7ba1\u5236\u9020\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6fc0\u5149\u5fae\u52a0\u5de5\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u805a\u9170\u4e9a\u80fa\uff08PI\uff09\u7ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u523b\u69fd\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u5f0f\u53ef\u5f2f\u66f2\u5173\u8282\uff1b\u5236\u5907\u591a\u79cd\u5916\u5f84\uff08OD\uff09\u7684PI\u7ba1\u5173\u8282\uff08\u6700\u5c0fOD\u8fbe1.5 mm\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u5f81\u5176\u52a0\u8f7d\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5236\u9020\u51fa\u5916\u5f84\u4f4e\u81f31.5 mm\u7684PI\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u5173\u8282\uff1b\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u7ec4\u4e0d\u540cOD PI\u7ba1\u5173\u8282\u7684\u52a0\u5de5\u4e0e\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u5149\u5fae\u52a0\u5de5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5236\u9020\u5fae\u578b\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u751f\u7269\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u597d\u4e14MRI\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7269\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u67d4\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u5668\u68b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u827a\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Tea production is a key industry for many countries. One of the main challenges in tea harvesting is tea leaf diseases. If the spread of tea leaf diseases is not stopped in time, it can lead to massive economic losses for farmers. Therefore, it is crucial to identify tea leaf diseases as soon as possible. Manually identifying tea leaf disease is an ineffective and time-consuming method, without any guarantee of success. Automating this process will improve both the efficiency and the success rate of identifying tea leaf diseases. The purpose of this study is to create an automated system that can classify different kinds of tea leaf diseases, allowing farmers to take action to minimize the damage. A novel dataset was developed specifically for this study. The dataset contains 5278 images across seven classes. The dataset was pre-processed prior to training the model.

In particular, with the rise of these approaches, studies have shown that users exhibit different POI choices in their familiar and unfamiliar areas, highlighting the importance of incorporating user familiarity into predictive models. However, existing methods often fail to distinguish between the movements of users in familiar and unfamiliar regions. To address this, we propose MoE-TransMov, a Transformer-based model with a Transformer model with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to use one framework to capture distinct mobility patterns across different moving contexts without requiring separate training for certain data. Using user-check-in data, we classify movements into familiar and unfamiliar categories and develop a specialized expert network to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach integrates self-attention mechanisms and adaptive gating networks to dynamically select the most relevant expert models for different mobility contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets, including the widely used but small open-source Foursquare NYC dataset and the large-scale Kyoto dataset collected with LY Corporation (Yahoo Japan Corporation), show that MoE-TransMov outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with notable improvements in Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 accuracy, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).

Most existing vision models rely on purely data-driven learning and produce black-box predictions with limited interpretability and poor cross-domain generalization, hindering their real-world clinical adoption. We present NEURO-GUARD, a novel knowledge-guided vision framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with language-driven reasoning to improve performance, transparency, and domain robustness. NEURO-GUARD employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for self-verification, in which a large language model (LLM) iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines feature-extraction code for medical images. By grounding this process in clinical guidelines and expert knowledge, the framework progressively enhances feature detection and classification beyond purely data-driven baselines. Extensive experiments on diabetic retinopathy classification across four benchmark datasets APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, and Messidor-2 demonstrate that NEURO-GUARD improves accuracy by 6.2% over a ViT-only baseline (84.69% vs. 78.4%) and achieves a 5% gain in domain generalization. Additional evaluations on MRI-based seizure detection further confirm its cross-domain robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods.\n  Overall, NEURO-GUARD bridges symbolic medical reasoning with subsymbolic visual learning, enabling interpretable, knowledge-aware, and generalizable medical image diagnosis while achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "NEURO-GUARD \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u578b\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u3001\u7ec6\u5fae\u5f81\u8c61\u548c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9ed1\u7bb1\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNEURO-GUARD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u878d\u5408ViT\u4e0eLLM\uff0c\u5229\u7528RAG\u673a\u5236\u8ba9LLM\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u9762\u5411\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u5357\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53476.2%\uff08\u8fbe84.69%\uff09\uff0c\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53475%\uff1b\u5728MRI\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NEURO-GUARD\u6210\u529f\u6865\u63a5\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4e9a\u7b26\u53f7\u89c6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

Conversations vary widely in type with some portion generating complex, dynamic stories. One approach to studying how conversations unfold in time is through statistical patterns such as Heaps' law, which holds that vocabulary size scales with document length. Little work on Heaps's law has looked at conversation and considered how language features impact scaling. We measure Heaps' law for conversations recorded in two distinct mediums: 1. Strangers brought together on video chat and 2. Fictional characters in movies. We find that scaling of vocabulary size differs by parts of speech.

Prior work has predominantly relied on manually engineered memory architectures to store trajectories, distill experience, and synthesize reusable tools, enabling agents to evolve on the fly within environment interactions. However, this paradigm is fundamentally constrained by the staticity of the memory system itself: while memory facilitates agent-level evolving, the underlying memory architecture cannot be meta-adapted to diverse task contexts. To address this gap, we propose MemEvolve, a meta-evolutionary framework that jointly evolves agents' experiential knowledge and their memory architecture, allowing agent systems not only to accumulate experience but also to progressively refine how they learn from it. To ground MemEvolve in prior research and foster openness in future self-evolving systems, we introduce EvolveLab, a unified self-evolving memory codebase that distills twelve representative memory systems into a modular design space (encode, store, retrieve, manage), providing both a standardized implementation substrate and a fair experimental arena. Extensive evaluations on four challenging agentic benchmarks demonstrate that MemEvolve achieves (I) substantial performance gains, improving frameworks such as SmolAgent and Flash-Searcher by up to $17.06\\%$; and (II) strong cross-task and cross-LLM generalization, designing memory architectures that transfer effectively across diverse benchmarks and backbone models.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemEvolve \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5143\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6f14\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u914d\u5957\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93 EvolveLab \u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e14\u9759\u6001\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa MemEvolve \u5143\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u6784\u5efa EvolveLab \u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u5c0612\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u56db\u5927\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cMemEvolve \u76f8\u6bd4 SmolAgent \u548c Flash-Searcher \u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347 17.06%\uff1b\u6240\u5b66\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u8de8\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MemEvolve \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8 LLM \u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5411\u771f\u6b63\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u8fc8\u8fdb\uff1bEvolveLab \u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002"}}

However, existing methods rely on model-internal signals (e.g., logits, entropy), which are fundamentally unreliable because LLMs are typically ill-calibrated and often exhibit high confidence in erroneous outputs. We propose QuCo-RAG, which shifts from subjective confidence to objective statistics computed from pre-training data. Our method quantifies uncertainty through two stages: (1) before generation, we identify low-frequency entities indicating long-tail knowledge gaps; (2) during generation, we verify entity co-occurrence in the pre-training corpus, where zero co-occurrence often signals hallucination risk. Both stages leverage Infini-gram for millisecond-latency queries over 4 trillion tokens, triggering retrieval when uncertainty is high. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show QuCo-RAG achieves EM gains of 5--12 points over state-of-the-art baselines with OLMo-2 models, and transfers effectively to models with undisclosed pre-training data (Llama, Qwen, GPT), improving EM by up to 14 points. Domain generalization on biomedical QA further validates the robustness of our paradigm.

To fully unlock the potential of IL for surgery, access to clinical datasets is needed, which unfortunately lack the kinematic data required for current IL approaches. A promising source of large-scale surgical demonstrations is monocular surgical videos available online, making monocular pose estimation a crucial step toward enabling large-scale robot learning. Toward this end, we propose SurgiPose, a differentiable rendering based approach to estimate kinematic information from monocular surgical videos, eliminating the need for direct access to ground truth kinematics. Our method infers tool trajectories and joint angles by optimizing tool pose parameters to minimize the discrepancy between rendered and real images. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on two robotic surgical tasks: tissue lifting and needle pickup, using the da Vinci Research Kit Si (dVRK Si). We train imitation learning policies with both ground truth measured kinematics and estimated kinematics from video and compare their performance. Our results show that policies trained on estimated kinematics achieve comparable success rates to those trained on ground truth data, demonstrating the feasibility of using monocular video based kinematic estimation for surgical robot learning.

While datasets exist with part annotations, their definitions are inconsistent across datasets, limiting robust training. Previous methods produce unlabeled decompositions or retrieve single parts without complete shape annotations. We propose ALIGN-Parts, which formulates part naming as a direct set alignment task. Our method decomposes shapes into partlets - implicit 3D part representations - matched to part descriptions via bipartite assignment. We combine geometric cues from 3D part fields, appearance from multi-view vision features, and semantic knowledge from language-model-generated affordance descriptions. Text-alignment loss ensures partlets share embedding space with text, enabling a theoretically open-vocabulary matching setup, given sufficient data. Our efficient and novel, one-shot, 3D part segmentation and naming method finds applications in several downstream tasks, including serving as a scalable annotation engine. As our model supports zero-shot matching to arbitrary descriptions and confidence-calibrated predictions for known categories, with human verification, we create a unified ontology that aligns PartNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Find3D, consisting of 1,794 unique 3D parts.

However, strict data-sharing regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) have prevented many data-driven applications from being realised. Federated Learning (FL), in which raw data never leaves local devices, has shown promise in overcoming these limitations. Although FL has grown rapidly in recent years, it still struggles with heterogeneity, which produces gradient noise, client-drift, and increased variance from partial client participation. In this paper, we propose FedOAED, a novel federated learning algorithm designed to mitigate client-drift arising from multiple local training updates and the variance induced by partial client participation. FedOAED incorporates an on-device autoencoder denoiser on the client side to mitigate client-drift and variance resulting from heterogeneous data under limited client availability.

In this paper, we propose NL2CA, a novel method for auto-formalizing cognitive decision-making rules from natural language descriptions of human experience. Different from most related work that exploits either pure manual or human guided interactive modeling, our method is fully automated without any human intervention. The approach first translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), then refines the logic via an unsupervised Critic Tree, and finally transforms the output into executable production rules compatible with symbolic cognitive frameworks. Based on the resulted rules, a cognitive agent is further constructed and optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning according to the real-world behavioral data. Our method is validated in two domains: (1) NL-to-LTL translation, where our CriticNL2LTL module achieves consistent performance across both expert and large-scale benchmarks without human-in-the-loop feed-backs, and (2) cognitive driving simulation, where agents automatically constructed from human interviews have successfully learned the diverse decision patterns of about 70 trials in different critical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that NL2CA enables scalable, interpretable, and human-aligned cognitive modeling from unstructured textual data, offering a novel paradigm to automatically design symbolic cognitive agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNL2CA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\uff08LTL\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u7ecf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763Critic Tree\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u8f6c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba4\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "NL2CA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3aLTL\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763Critic Tree\u5bf9LTL\u8fdb\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u7cbe\u70bc\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u7cbe\u70bc\u540e\u7684LTL\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u6240\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728NL-to-LTL\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cCriticNL2LTL\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a7e\u9a76\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbf\u8c08\u6587\u672c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u7ea670\u6b21\u4e0d\u540c\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "NL2CA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5230\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u8ba4\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We further introduce Autoformalization with Soft Unification, which reduces natural language ambiguity and improves formalization quality, enabling more effective use of the theorem prover. An 8B model trained on data constructed with LogicReward surpasses GPT-4o and o4-mini by 11.6\\% and 2\\% on natural language inference and logical reasoning tasks with simple training procedures. Further analysis shows that LogicReward enhances reasoning faithfulness, improves generalizability to unseen tasks such as math and commonsense reasoning, and provides a reliable reward signal even without ground-truth labels.

This thesis presents an integrated AI-driven framework for autonomous guidewire navigation in complex vascular environments, addressing key challenges in data availability, simulation fidelity, and navigational accuracy.\n  A high-fidelity, real-time simulation platform, CathSim, is introduced for reinforcement learning based catheter navigation, featuring anatomically accurate vascular models and contact dynamics. Building on CathSim, the Expert Navigation Network is developed, a policy that fuses visual, kinematic, and force feedback for autonomous tool control. To mitigate data scarcity, the open-source, bi-planar fluoroscopic dataset Guide3D is proposed, comprising more than 8,700 annotated images for 3D guidewire reconstruction. Finally, SplineFormer, a transformer-based model, is introduced to directly predict guidewire geometry as continuous B-spline parameters, enabling interpretable, real-time navigation.\n  The findings show that combining high-fidelity simulation, multimodal sensory fusion, and geometric modelling substantially improves autonomous endovascular navigation and supports safer, more precise minimally invasive procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e1d\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0CathSim\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6Guide3D\u53ca\u65b0\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578bSplineFormer\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8840\u7ba1\u5185\u4ecb\u5165\u624b\u672f\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8840\u7ba1\u5185\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4f4e\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5fae\u521b\u4ecb\u5165\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0CathSim\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e0e\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u7684Expert Navigation Network\uff1b\u53d1\u5e03\u5f00\u6e90\u53cc\u5e73\u9762X\u5149\u6570\u636e\u96c6Guide3D\uff088700+\u6807\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684SplineFormer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4bB\u6837\u6761\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u5bfc\u4e1d\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8840\u7ba1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u534f\u540c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96c6\u6210AI\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u8840\u7ba1\u5185\u4ecb\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4ecb\u5165\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

The conventional approach to address this involves a two-stage pipeline: an OCR system extracts text from handwritten images, which is then translated into the target language using a machine translation model. In this work, we explore and compare the performance of traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models that aim to unify these stages and directly translate handwritten text images in a single, end-to-end step. Our motivation is grounded in the urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records such as FIRs, charge sheets, and witness statements in India's district and high courts. We evaluate both approaches on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents, with the goal of enabling efficient legal document processing, even in low-resource environments. Our findings offer actionable insights toward building robust, edge-deployable solutions that enhance access to legal information for non-native speakers and legal professionals alike.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfOCR-MT\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLLM\uff09\u5728\u624b\u5199\u9a6c\u62c9\u5730\u8bed\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u6863\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u672c\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5370\u5ea6\u5730\u65b9\u6cd5\u9662\u548c\u9ad8\u7b49\u6cd5\u9662\u7684\u624b\u5199\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08\u5982FIR\u3001\u8d77\u8bc9\u4e66\u3001\u8bc1\u4eba\u9648\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u9a6c\u62c9\u5730\u8bed\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f20\u7edfOCR+\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u624b\u5199\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u624b\u5199\u9a6c\u62c9\u5730\u8bed\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u6863\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u624b\u5199\u9a6c\u62c9\u5730\u8bed\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u6863\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u624b\u5199\u6587\u672c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u6bcd\u8bed\u8005\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this study, we publish a labelled ICU dataset and benchmarks for AF detection. Methods: We compared machine learning models across three data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches: feature-based classifiers, deep learning (DL), and ECG foundation models (FMs). This comparison addresses a critical gap in the literature and aims to pinpoint which AI approach is best for accurate AF detection. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) from a Canadian ICU and the 2021 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge were used to conduct the experiments. Multiple training configurations were tested, ranging from zero-shot inference to transfer learning. Results: On average and across both datasets, ECG FMs performed best, followed by DL, then feature-based classifiers. The model that achieved the top F1 score on our ICU test set was ECG-FM through a transfer learning strategy (F1=0.89). Conclusion: This study demonstrates promising potential for using AI to build an automatic patient monitoring system.

Unlike traditional weight-space optimization methods, this framework constructs topological cognitive maps through dimensionality reduction projection, enabling precise navigation and intervention of energy flow at test time while avoiding substantial computational requirements and demonstrating predictable intervention patterns. The method effectively addresses the cognitive deadlock problem in multi-step reasoning for small models. Experiments on models <=7B parameters show: map-guided methods achieve 81.20% accuracy on 500 challenging problems (relative baseline +16.80%), reduce reasoning time by >= 15x, with key findings revealing that reasoning stagnation manifests as \"Cognitive Vortex\" and low-entropy potential wells, while temperature perturbations effectively restart energy flow. The framework requires no additional training, possesses autonomous growth capability, and provides an efficient and controllable topological-aware solution for small model reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faExternal Hippocampus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u8ba4\u77e5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u52a8\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u8ba4\u77e5\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7cbe\u51c6\u5e72\u9884\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u22647B\uff09\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u2018\u8ba4\u77e5\u6f29\u6da1\u2019\u7b49\u505c\u6ede\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6613\u9677\u5165\u8ba4\u77e5\u50f5\u5c40\uff08cognitive deadlock\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6743\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u5e72\u9884\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u8ba4\u77e5\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u52a8\uff1b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7b49\u65b9\u5f0f\u5e72\u9884\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u9003\u79bb\u4f4e\u71b5\u52bf\u9631\uff08\u5982\u2018Cognitive Vortex\u2019\uff09\uff0c\u5168\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u22647B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9500\u9053\u96be\u9898\u8fbe\u523081.20%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u57fa\u7ebf+16.80%\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u8017\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u226515\u500d\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u505c\u6ede\u5bf9\u5e94\u2018Cognitive Vortex\u2019\u4e0e\u4f4e\u71b5\u52bf\u9631\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u542f\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "External Hippocampus\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u81ea\u751f\u957f\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Methods: We introduce NodMAISI, an anatomically constrained, nodule-oriented CT synthesis and augmentation framework trained on a unified multi-source cohort (7,042 patients, 8,841 CTs, 14,444 nodules). The framework integrates: (i) a standardized curation and annotation pipeline linking each CT with organ masks and nodule-level annotations, (ii) a ControlNet-conditioned rectified-flow generator built on MAISI-v2's foundational blocks to enforce anatomy- and lesion-consistent synthesis, and (iii) lesion-aware augmentation that perturbs nodule masks (controlled shrinkage) while preserving surrounding anatomy to generate paired CT variants. Results: Across six public test datasets, NodMAISI improved distributional fidelity relative to MAISI-v2 (real-to-synthetic FID range 1.18 to 2.99 vs 1.69 to 5.21). In lesion detectability analysis using a MONAI nodule detector, NodMAISI substantially increased average sensitivity and more closely matched clinical scans (IMD-CT: 0.69 vs 0.39; DLCS24: 0.63 vs 0.20), with the largest gains for sub-centimeter nodules where MAISI-v2 frequently failed to reproduce the conditioned lesion. In downstream nodule-level malignancy classification trained on LUNA25 and externally evaluated on LUNA16, LNDbv4, and DLCS24, NodMAISI augmentation improved AUC by 0.07 to 0.11 at <=20% clinical data and by 0.12 to 0.21 at 10%, consistently narrowing the performance gap under data scarcity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNodMAISI\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u7684CT\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u5256\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u75c5\u7076\u5bfc\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u7ed3\u8282\u751f\u6210\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u826f\u6076\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u80ba\u764c\u7b5b\u67e5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5c0f\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u7b49\u5f02\u5e38\u75c5\u53d8\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaNodMAISI\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6e90\u961f\u5217\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eMAISI-v2\u5e76\u5f15\u5165ControlNet\u4e0e\u6821\u6b63\u6d41\uff08rectified-flow\uff09\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u4e0e\u75c5\u7076\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u75c5\u7076\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ed3\u8282\u63a9\u819c\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u63a7\u6536\u7f29\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u914d\u5bf9CT\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNodMAISI\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08FID\uff09\u4f18\u4e8eMAISI-v2\uff1b\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5982IMD-CT\u8fbe0.69 vs 0.39\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u6076\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u752810%\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u65f6AUC\u63d0\u53470.12\u20130.21\u3002", "conclusion": "NodMAISI\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5c0f\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u75c5\u7076\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u533b\u7597AI\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

As these systems are increasingly deployed in critical areas, ensuring their privacy and alignment with human values is paramount. Recently, selective forgetting (also known as machine unlearning) has shown promise for privacy and data removal tasks, and has emerged as a transformative paradigm shift in the field of AI. It refers to the ability of a model to selectively erase the influence of previously seen data, which is especially important for compliance with modern data protection regulations and for aligning models with human values. Despite its promise, selective forgetting raises significant privacy concerns, especially when the data involved come from sensitive domains. While new unlearning-induced privacy attacks are continuously proposed, each is shown to outperform its predecessors using different experimental settings, which can lead to overly optimistic and potentially unfair assessments that may disproportionately favor one particular attack over the others. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating privacy vulnerabilities in selective forgetting. We extensively investigate privacy vulnerabilities of machine unlearning techniques and benchmark privacy leakage across a wide range of victim data, state-of-the-art unlearning privacy attacks, unlearning methods, and model architectures. We systematically evaluate and identify critical factors related to unlearning-induced privacy leakage. With our novel insights, we aim to provide a standardized tool for practitioners seeking to deploy customized unlearning applications with faithful privacy assessments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff08\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u516c\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u3001\u524d\u6cbf\u9057\u5fd8\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u7c7b\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u5408\u89c4\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Yet, most architectures remain static and reactive, tethered to manually defined, narrow scenarios. These systems excel at perception (System 1) and deliberation (System 2) but lack a persistent meta-layer to maintain identity, verify reasoning, and align short-term actions with long-term survival. We first propose a third stratum, System 3, that presides over the agent's narrative identity and long-horizon adaptation. The framework maps selected psychological constructs to concrete computational modules, thereby translating abstract notions of artificial life into implementable design requirements. The ideas coalesce in Sophia, a \"Persistent Agent\" wrapper that grafts a continuous self-improvement loop onto any LLM-centric System 1/2 stack. Sophia is driven by four synergistic mechanisms: process-supervised thought search, narrative memory, user and self modeling, and a hybrid reward system. Together, they transform repetitive reasoning into a self-driven, autobiographical process, enabling identity continuity and transparent behavioral explanations. Although the paper is primarily conceptual, we provide a compact engineering prototype to anchor the discussion. Quantitatively, Sophia independently initiates and executes various intrinsic tasks while achieving an 80% reduction in reasoning steps for recurring operations.

Therefore, search engines have taken over as peoples preferred resource. The How To prefix has become familiar and widely used in various search styles to find solutions to particular problems. This search allows people to find sequential instructions by providing detailed guidelines to accomplish specific tasks. Categorizing instructional text is also essential for task-oriented learning and creating knowledge bases. This study uses the How To articles to determine the multi-label instruction category. We have brought this work with a dataset comprising 11,121 observations from wikiHow, where each record has multiple categories. To find out the multi-label category meticulously, we employ some transformer-based deep neural architectures, such as Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding (XLNet), Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), etc. In our multi-label instruction classification process, we have reckoned our proposed architectures using accuracy and macro f1-score as the performance metrics. This thorough evaluation showed us much about our strategys strengths and drawbacks. Specifically, our implementation of the XLNet architecture has demonstrated unprecedented performance, achieving an accuracy of 97.30% and micro and macro average scores of 89.02% and 93%, a noteworthy accomplishment in multi-label classification. This high level of accuracy and macro average score is a testament to the effectiveness of the XLNet architecture in our proposed InstructNet approach.

We introduce an optimization-based framework that jointly learns a small set of synergies and their sparse activation coefficients. The formulation enforces group sparsity for synergy selection and element-wise sparsity for activation timing.

However, detecting drones is challenging because of their small size, rapid movement, and low visual contrast. A modified architecture of YolovN called the YolovN-CBi is proposed that incorporates the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) to improve sensitivity to small object detections. A curated training dataset consisting of 28K images is created with various flying objects and a local test dataset is collected with 2500 images consisting of very small drone objects. The proposed architecture is evaluated on four benchmark datasets, along with the local test dataset. The baseline Yolov5 and the proposed Yolov5-CBi architecture outperform newer Yolo versions, including Yolov8 and Yolov12, in the speed-accuracy trade-off for small object detection. Four other variants of the proposed CBi architecture are also proposed and evaluated, which vary in the placement and usage of CBAM and BiFPN. These variants are further distilled using knowledge distillation techniques for edge deployment, using a Yolov5m-CBi teacher and a Yolov5n-CBi student. The distilled model achieved a mA@P0.5:0.9 of 0.6573, representing a 6.51% improvement over the teacher's score of 0.6171, highlighting the effectiveness of the distillation process. The distilled model is 82.9% faster than the baseline model, making it more suitable for real-time drone detection.

The digital twin is learned via amortized variational inference, enabling scalable posterior estimation while retaining a fully probabilistic interpretation. We instantiate this framework using a variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to a user-response dataset designed to capture stable aspects of user identity. Beyond standard reconstruction-based evaluation, we introduce a statistically grounded interpretation pipeline that links latent dimensions to observable behavioral patterns. By analyzing users at the extremes of each latent dimension and validating differences using nonparametric hypothesis tests and effect sizes, we demonstrate that specific dimensions correspond to interpretable traits such as opinion strength and decisiveness. Empirically, we find that user structure is predominantly continuous rather than discretely clustered, with weak but meaningful structure emerging along a small number of dominant latent axes. These results suggest that probabilistic digital twins can provide interpretable, uncertainty-aware representations that go beyond deterministic user embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6982\u7387\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u6f5c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u8ba1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u89c2\u70b9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u51b3\u65ad\u529b\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7528\u6237\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u8981\u5448\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u6237\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u6216\u9ed1\u7bb1\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e amortized variational inference \u7684\u6982\u7387\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5 VAE \u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7edf\u8ba1\u89e3\u91ca\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5206\u6790\u5404\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e24\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6548\u5e94\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u800c\u975e\u79bb\u6563\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6f5c\u5728\u8f74\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5fae\u5f31\u4f46\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u7279\u5b9a\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u610f\u89c1\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u51b3\u65ad\u529b\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u7387\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u3002"}}

However, current large language model (LLM)-based theorem provers suffer from limitations such as restricted domain coverage and weak generalization in mathematical reasoning. To address these issues, we propose MSC-180, a benchmark for evaluation based on the MSC2020 mathematical subject classification. It comprises 180 formal verification problems, 3 advanced problems from each of 60 mathematical branches, spanning from undergraduate to graduate levels. Each problem has undergone multiple rounds of verification and refinement by domain experts to ensure formal accuracy. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers under the pass@32 setting reveal that the best model achieves only an 18.89% overall pass rate, with prominent issues including significant domain bias (maximum domain coverage 41.7%) and a difficulty gap (significantly lower pass rates on graduate-level problems). To further quantify performance variability across mathematical domains, we introduce the coefficient of variation (CV) as an evaluation metric. The observed CV values are 4-6 times higher than the statistical high-variability threshold, indicating that the models still rely on pattern matching from training corpora rather than possessing transferable reasoning mechanisms and systematic generalization capabilities.

To handle testing domains, domain adaptation (DA) is trained to adapt to a fixed and observed testing domain; a more challenging paradigm, test-time adaptation (TTA), cannot access the testing domain during training and online adapts to the testing samples during testing, where the samples are from a fixed domain. We aim to explore a more practical and underexplored scenario, continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) for text understanding, which involves a sequence of testing (unobserved) domains in testing. Current CTTA methods struggle in reducing error accumulation over domains and enhancing generalization to handle unobserved domains: 1) Noise-filtering reduces accumulated errors but discards useful information, and 2) accumulating historical domains enhances generalization, but it is hard to achieve adaptive accumulation. In this paper, we propose a CTTA-T (continual test-time adaptation for text understanding) framework adaptable to evolving target domains: it adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher is domain-aware and generalized for evolving domains. To improve teacher predictions, we propose a refine-then-filter based on dropout-driven consistency, which calibrates predictions and removes unreliable guidance. For the adaptation-generalization trade-off, we construct a domain-aware teacher by dynamically accumulating cross-domain semantics via incremental PCA, which continuously tracks domain shifts.

We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%.

The VDMN captures microstructure-induced variability by embedding variational distributions within its hierarchical, mechanistic architecture. Using an analytic propagation scheme based on Taylor-series expansion and automatic differentiation, the VDMN efficiently propagates uncertainty through the network during training and prediction. We demonstrate its capabilities in two digital-twin-driven applications: (1) as an uncertainty-aware materials digital twin, it predicts and experimentally validates the nonlinear mechanical variability in additively manufactured polymer composites; and (2) as an inverse calibration engine, it disentangles and quantitatively identifies overlapping sources of uncertainty in constituent properties.

Reasoning models improve LLM performance in multi-hop QA tasks, which require integrating and reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence across different documents to answer a complex question. However, they often introduce substantial computational costs, including increased token consumption and inference latency. To better understand and mitigate this trade-off, we conduct a comprehensive study of reasoning strategies for reasoning models in RAG multi-hop QA tasks. Our findings reveal that reasoning models adopt structured strategies to integrate retrieved and internal knowledge, primarily following two modes: Context-Grounded Reasoning, which relies directly on retrieved content, and Knowledge-Reconciled Reasoning, which resolves conflicts or gaps using internal knowledge. To this end, we propose a novel Lightweight Rerank Reasoning Strategy Framework for RAG (LiR$^3$AG) to enable non-reasoning models to transfer reasoning strategies by restructuring retrieved evidence into coherent reasoning chains. LiR$^3$AG significantly reduce the average 98% output tokens overhead and 58.6% inferencing time while improving 8B non-reasoning model's F1 performance ranging from 6.2% to 22.5% to surpass the performance of 32B reasoning model in RAG, offering a practical and efficient path forward for RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6LiR\u00b3AG\uff0c\u4f7f\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6765\u8fc1\u79fb\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728RAG\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff08\u5982token\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u6743\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728RAG\u591a\u8df3QA\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51faContext-Grounded Reasoning\u548cKnowledge-Reconciled Reasoning\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6LiR\u00b3AG\uff0c\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u3002", "result": "LiR\u00b3AG\u5c06\u8f93\u51fatoken\u5f00\u9500\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e98%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1158.6%\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f8B\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578bF1\u63d0\u53476.2%\u201322.5%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a32B\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LiR\u00b3AG\u4e3aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Monitoring the chain-of-thought (CoT) of today's reasoning models has proven effective for detecting misbehavior. However, this \"monitorability\" may be fragile under different training procedures, data sources, or even continued system scaling. To measure and track monitorability, we propose three evaluation archetypes (intervention, process, and outcome-property) and a new monitorability metric, and introduce a broad evaluation suite. We demonstrate that these evaluations can catch simple model organisms trained to have obfuscated CoTs, and that CoT monitoring is more effective than action-only monitoring in practical settings. We compare the monitorability of various frontier models and find that most models are fairly, but not perfectly, monitorable. We also evaluate how monitorability scales with inference-time compute, reinforcement learning optimization, and pre-training model size. We find that longer CoTs are generally more monitorable and that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability even at the current frontier scale. Notably, we find that for a model at a low reasoning effort, we could instead deploy a smaller model at a higher reasoning effort (thereby matching capabilities) and obtain a higher monitorability, albeit at a higher overall inference compute cost. We further investigate agent-monitor scaling trends and find that scaling a weak monitor's test-time compute when monitoring a strong agent increases monitorability. Giving the weak monitor access to CoT not only improves monitorability, but it steepens the monitor's test-time compute to monitorability scaling trend. Finally, we show we can improve monitorability by asking models follow-up questions and giving their follow-up CoT to the monitor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CoT\u76d1\u63a7\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u76d1\u63a7\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0RL\u4f18\u5316\u672a\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\uff1b\u8f83\u957fCoT\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u52aa\u529b\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u7eed\u8ffd\u95ee\u5747\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u867d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u3001\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5957\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u7269\u3001\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21/\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84/\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u4e0e\u88ab\u76d1\u63a7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b97\u529b\u3001\u662f\u5426\u63a5\u5165CoT\u3001\u662f\u5426\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u7eed\u8ffd\u95ee\u7b49\u3002", "result": "CoT\u76d1\u63a7\u6bd4\u52a8\u4f5c\u76d1\u63a7\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u591a\u6570\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u4e2d\u7b49\u4f46\u975e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\uff1b\u66f4\u957fCoT\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\uff1b\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u52aa\u529b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u88ab\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u52aa\u529b\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\uff08\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff09\uff1b\u589e\u5f3a\u5f31\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b97\u529b\u5e76\u8d4b\u4e88\u5176CoT\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u9661\u5316\u5176\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u589e\u957f\u66f2\u7ebf\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u7eed\u8ffd\u95ee\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5176CoT\u4ea6\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u662f\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u9700\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, their real-world deployment is hindered by severe inefficiencies that arise not from isolated model inference, but from the systemic latency accumulated across reasoning loops, context growth, and heterogeneous tool interactions. This paper presents AgentInfer, a unified framework for end-to-end agent acceleration that bridges inference optimization and architectural design. We decompose the problem into four synergistic components: AgentCollab, a hierarchical dual-model reasoning framework that balances large- and small-model usage through dynamic role assignment; AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler that minimizes latency under heterogeneous request patterns; AgentSAM, a suffix-automaton-based speculative decoding method that reuses multi-session semantic memory to achieve low-overhead inference acceleration; and AgentCompress, a semantic compression mechanism that asynchronously distills and reorganizes agent memory without disrupting ongoing reasoning. Together, these modules form a Self-Evolution Engine capable of sustaining efficiency and cognitive stability throughout long-horizon reasoning tasks. Experiments on the BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver benchmarks demonstrate that through the synergistic collaboration of these methods, AgentInfer reduces ineffective token consumption by over 50%, achieving an overall 1.8-2.5 times speedup with preserved accuracy. These results underscore that optimizing for agentic task completion-rather than merely per-token throughput-is the key to building scalable, efficient, and self-improving intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAgentInfer\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u6a21\u5757\uff08AgentCollab\u3001AgentSched\u3001AgentSAM\u3001AgentCompress\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u65e0\u6548token\u6d88\u8017\u8d8550%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u63d0\u901f1.8\u20132.5\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u6240\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentInfer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09AgentCollab\u2014\u2014\u5206\u5c42\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u914d\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2\uff09AgentSched\u2014\u2014\u7f13\u5b58\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff1b3\uff09AgentSAM\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u540e\u7f00\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bed\u4e49\u8bb0\u5fc6\u590d\u7528\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff1b4\uff09AgentCompress\u2014\u2014\u5f02\u6b65\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\u3002\u56db\u8005\u6784\u6210\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u5728BrowseComp-zh\u548cDeepDiver\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65e0\u6548token\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8550%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.8\u20132.5\u500d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65e0\u635f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff08\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u6bcftoken\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

For these applications, accurately distinguishing between key surfaces and objects such as roads, sidewalks, vehicles, and pedestrians is essential for maintaining safety and minimizing risks. Semantic segmentation must be robust to different environments, lighting and weather conditions, and sensor noise, while being performed in real-time. We propose a region-level, uncertainty-gated retrieval mechanism that improves segmentation accuracy and calibration under domain shift. Our best method achieves an 11.3% increase in mean intersection-over-union while reducing retrieval cost by 87.5%, retrieving for only 12.5% of regions compared to 100% for always-on baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6237\u5916\u8857\u666f\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\uff0c\u5728mIoU\u4e0a\u63d0\u534711.3%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e87.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6237\u5916\u8857\u666f\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u89c6\u969c\u8f85\u52a9\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5149\u7167\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u53ca\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u7d22\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd4\uff08mIoU\uff09\u4e0a\u63d0\u534711.3%\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e87.5%\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf912.5%\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95e8\u63a7\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Recent deep learning-based models have reduced various modeling assumptions including proportional hazard and linearity. However, a persistent challenge remains in incorporating longitudinal covariates, with prior work largely focusing on cross-sectional features, and in assessing calibration of these models, with research primarily focusing on discrimination during evaluation. We introduce TraCeR, a transformer-based survival analysis framework for incorporating longitudinal covariates. Based on a factorized self-attention architecture, TraCeR estimates the hazard function from a sequence of measurements, naturally capturing temporal covariate interactions without assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. The framework is inherently designed to handle censored data and competing events. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that TraCeR achieves substantial and statistically significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our evaluation extends beyond discrimination metrics and assesses model calibration, addressing a key oversight in literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TraCeR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u7eb5\u5411\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f30\u8ba1\u98ce\u9669\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u505a\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5929\u7136\u652f\u6301\u5220\u5931\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u7eb5\u5411\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff08discrimination\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\uff08calibration\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTraCeR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u7eb5\u5411\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u98ce\u9669\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u539f\u751f\u652f\u6301\u53f3\u5220\u5931\u4e0e\u7ade\u4e89\u98ce\u9669\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTraCeR\u5728\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982C-index\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u62a5\u544a\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\uff08\u5982Brier score\u3001calibration plot\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TraCeR\u4e3a\u7eb5\u5411\u751f\u5b58\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u4e0e\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u751f\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u90e8\u7f72\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002"}}

The core idea is to make structure the carrier of explanations: an image is encoded as an attributed graph (critical points and lines represented as nodes with geometric attributes), and generalization is achieved via the formation of concept attractors (class-level concept graphs). Purpose. To design and experimentally validate an architecture in which class concepts are formed from a handful of examples (5 - 6 per class) through structural and parametric reductions, providing transparent decisions and eliminating backpropagation. Methods. Contour vectorization is followed by constructing a bipartite graph (Point/Line as nodes) with normalized geometric attributes such as coordinates, length, angle, and direction; reductions include the elimination of unstable substructures or noise and the alignment of paths between critical points. Concepts are formed by iterative composition of samples, and classification is performed by selecting the best graph-to-concept match (using approximated GED). Results. On an MNIST subset with 5 - 6 base examples per class (single epoch), we obtain a consistent accuracy of around 82% with full traceability of decisions: misclassifications can be explained by explicit structural similarities. An indicative comparison with SVM, MLP, CNN, as well as metric and meta-learning baselines, is provided. The structural-graph scheme with concept attractors enables few-shot learning without backpropagation and offers built-in explanations through the explicit graph structure. Limitations concern the computational cost of GED and the quality of skeletonization; promising directions include classification-algorithm optimization, work with static scenes, and associative recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5e26\u51e0\u4f55\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u7c7b\u7ea7\u6982\u5ff5\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff08\u6bcf\u7c7b5-6\u4e2a\uff09\u5373\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u5177\u5907\u900f\u660e\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u8f6e\u5ed3\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u77e2\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u70b9/\u7ebf\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\u5e76\u8d4b\u4e88\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5750\u6807\u3001\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u89d2\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u5411\uff09\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5254\u9664\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8def\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5316\uff1b\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec4\u5408\u6837\u672c\u5f62\u6210\u6982\u5ff5\u56fe\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08GED\uff09\u5339\u914d\u6700\u4f18\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6bcf\u7c7b\u4ec55-6\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684MNIST\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5355\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea682%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u5168\u7a0b\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\uff1b\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4SVM\u3001MLP\u3001CNN\u53ca\u5ea6\u91cf/\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe+\u6982\u5ff5\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u5185\u751f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u5728\u4e8eGED\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u9aa8\u67b6\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

With the literature focusing on controlling the four rotors' RPMs directly, this paper aims to control the quadrotor's thrust vector. The RL agent computes the percentage of overall thrust along the quadrotor's z-axis along with the desired Roll ($\u03c6$) and Pitch ($\u03b8$) angles. The agent then sends the calculated control signals along with the current quadrotor's Yaw angle ($\u03c8$) to an attitude PID controller. The PID controller then maps the control signals to motor RPMs. The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, a model-free off-policy stochastic RL algorithm, was used to train the RL agents. Training results show the faster training time of the proposed thrust vector controller in comparison to the conventional RPM controllers. Simulation results show smoother and more accurate path-following for the proposed thrust vector controller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u529b\u77e2\u91cf\uff08\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u5404\u7535\u673a\u8f6c\u901f\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Soft Actor-Critic\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u56db\u4e2a\u65cb\u7ffc\u7684\u8f6c\u901f\uff08RPM\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u529b\u77e2\u91cf\uff08\u5373z\u8f74\u63a8\u529b\u5360\u6bd4\u53ca\u671f\u671b\u6a2a\u6eda/\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eSoft Actor-Critic\uff08SAC\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u8f93\u51faz\u8f74\u63a8\u529b\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u3001\u671f\u671bRoll\uff08\u03c6\uff09\u548cPitch\uff08\u03b8\uff09\u89d2\uff1b\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fde\u540c\u5f53\u524dYaw\uff08\u03c8\uff09\u89d2\u9001\u5165\u5e95\u5c42\u59ff\u6001PID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7531PID\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u5404\u7535\u673aRPM\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u63a8\u529b\u77e2\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfRPM\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u529b\u77e2\u91cf\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RL\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178PID\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Although recent studies have led to the advent of deep learning methods using satellite imagery to predict height maps, these approaches often face a trade-off between data accessibility and spatial resolution. To overcome these limitations, we present SERA-H, an end-to-end model combining a super-resolution module (EDSR) and temporal attention encoding (UTAE). Trained under the supervision of high-density LiDAR data (ALS), our model generates 2.5 m resolution height maps from freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) time series data. Evaluated on an open-source benchmark dataset in France, SERA-H, with a MAE of 2.6 m and a coefficient of determination of 0.82, not only outperforms standard Sentinel-1/2 baselines but also achieves performance comparable to or better than methods relying on commercial very high-resolution imagery (SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope, Maxar). These results demonstrate that combining high-resolution supervision with the spatiotemporal information embedded in time series enables the reconstruction of details beyond the input sensors' native resolution. SERA-H opens the possibility of freely mapping forests with high revisit frequency, achieving accuracy comparable to that of costly commercial imagery.

Code: https://github.com/AI4Risk/antifraud and https://github.com/Muyiiiiii/WWW25-Grad", "summary": "Nowadays, Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) in financial scenarios has become an urgent research topic to protect online payment security. However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets. The results show that our proposed model Grad outperforms SOTA methods in both various scenarios, achieving at most 11.10% and 43.95% increases in AUC and AP, respectively.

Its performance is compared against algorithms that train a deterministic one. Stochastic policies optimize a probability distribution over actions to maximize rewards, while deterministic policies select a single deterministic action per state. The effect of training a stochastic policy with both static entropy and dynamic entropy and then executing deterministic actions to control the quadcopter is explored. It is then compared against training a deterministic policy and executing deterministic actions. For the purpose of this research, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm was chosen for the stochastic algorithm while the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) was chosen for the deterministic algorithm. The training and simulation results show the positive effect the dynamic entropy tuning has on controlling the quadcopter by preventing catastrophic forgetting and improving exploration efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u968f\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u52a8\u6001\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Soft Actor-Critic\uff08SAC\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u9759\u6001/\u52a8\u6001\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\uff08TD3\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e8c\u8005\u63a7\u5236\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u52a8\u6001\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u968f\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u71b5\u8c03\u8282\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u71b5\u6216\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

Webster", "Ipek Oguz"], "title": "EndoStreamDepth: Temporally Consistent Monocular Depth Estimation for Endoscopic Video Streams", "comment": null, "summary": "This work presents EndoStreamDepth, a monocular depth estimation framework for endoscopic video streams. It provides accurate depth maps with sharp anatomical boundaries for each frame, temporally consistent predictions across frames, and real-time throughput. Unlike prior work that uses batched inputs, EndoStreamDepth processes individual frames with a temporal module to propagate inter-frame information. The framework contains three main components: (1) a single-frame depth network with endoscopy-specific transformation to produce accurate depth maps, (2) multi-level Mamba temporal modules that leverage inter-frame information to improve accuracy and stabilize predictions, and (3) a hierarchical design with comprehensive multi-scale supervision, where complementary loss terms jointly improve local boundary sharpness and global geometric consistency. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two publicly available colonoscopy depth estimation datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods, EndoStreamDepth substantially improves performance, and it produces depth maps with sharp, anatomically aligned boundaries, which are essential to support downstream tasks such as automation for robotic surgery.

We first interpret recent data privacy and portability law to argue that these intermediate computations qualify as users' personal data. Then, building on the existing framework of Conscious Data Contribution, we show how communities who receive low utility from an available model can aggregate and distill their shared knowledge into an alternate model better aligned with their goals.

This paper proposes a post-hoc ITD framework that integrates explicit and implicit graph representations with temporal modelling to capture complex user behaviour patterns. An explicit graph is constructed using predefined organisational rules to model direct relationships among user activities. To mitigate noise and limitations in this hand-crafted structure, an implicit graph is learned from feature similarities using the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling the discovery of latent behavioural relationships. Separate Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) process the explicit and implicit graphs to generate node embeddings, which are concatenated and refined through an attention mechanism to emphasise threat-relevant features. The refined representations are then passed to a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies in user behaviour. Activities are flagged as anomalous when their probability scores fall below a predefined threshold. Extensive experiments on CERT r5.2 and r6.2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On r5.2, the model achieves an AUC of 98.62, a detection rate of 100%, and a false positive rate of 0.05. On the more challenging r6.2 dataset, it attains an AUC of 88.48, a detection rate of 80.15%, and a false positive rate of 0.15, highlighting the effectiveness of combining graph-based and temporal representations for robust ITD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u9a8c\u5f0f\u5185\u90e8\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GCN\u548cBi-LSTM\u63d0\u53d6\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728CERT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5185\u90e8\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\u5728\u4e8e\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u9690\u853d\u4e14\u7531\u53ef\u4fe1\u7528\u6237\u53d1\u8d77\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u3001\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u56fe\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff08Gumbel-Softmax\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u56fe\uff1b\u5206\u522b\u7528GCN\u63d0\u53d6\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7ecf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u540e\u8f93\u5165Bi-LSTM\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u4f9d\u636e\u6982\u7387\u9608\u503c\u5224\u5b9a\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5728CERT r5.2\u4e0aAUC\u8fbe98.62%\uff0c\u68c0\u51fa\u7387100%\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u73870.05%\uff1b\u5728\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684r6.2\u4e0aAUC\u4e3a88.48%\uff0c\u68c0\u51fa\u738780.15%\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u73870.15%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u90e8\u5a01\u80c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing skill-based methods attempt to address this by decomposing actions into reusable abstractions, but they often rely on fixed-length segmentation or environmental priors that limit semantic consistency and cross-task generalization. In this work, we propose AtomSkill, a novel multi-task imitation learning framework that learns and leverages a structured Atomic Skill Space for composable robot manipulation. Our approach is built on two key technical contributions. First, we construct a Semantically Grounded Atomic Skill Library by partitioning demonstrations into variable-length skills using gripper-state keyframe detection and vision-language model annotation. A contrastive learning objective ensures the resulting skill embeddings are both semantically consistent and temporally coherent. Second, we propose an Action Generation module with Keypose Imagination, which jointly predicts a skill's long-horizon terminal keypose and its immediate action sequence. This enables the policy to reason about overarching motion goals and fine-grained control simultaneously, facilitating robust skill chaining. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that AtomSkill consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse manipulation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAtomSkill\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49 grounded \u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u4f4d\u59ff\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u6216\u73af\u5883\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6f14\u793a\u6b21\u4f18\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49 grounded \u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5939\u722a\u72b6\u6001\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6807\u6ce8\u5bf9\u6f14\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u6280\u80fd\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e26\u5173\u952e\u4f4d\u59ff\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u7ec8\u7aef\u5173\u952e\u4f4d\u59ff\u4e0e\u5373\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cAtomSkill\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AtomSkill\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, for real-world applications such as 3D Computed Tomography (CT) imaging, directly training diffusion models on 3D data presents significant challenges due to the high computational demands of extensive GPU resources and large-scale datasets. Existing works mostly reuse 2D diffusion priors to address 3D inverse problems, but fail to fully realize and leverage the generative capacity of diffusion models for high-dimensional data. In this study, we propose a novel 3D patch-based diffusion model that can learn a fully 3D diffusion prior from limited data, enabling scalable generation of high-resolution 3D images. Our core idea is to learn the prior of 3D patches to achieve scalable efficiency, while coupling local and global information to guarantee high-quality 3D image generation, by modeling the joint distribution of position-aware 3D local patches and downsampled 3D volume as global context. Our approach not only enables high-quality 3D generation, but also offers an unprecedentedly efficient and accurate solution to high-resolution 3D inverse problems. Experiments on 3D CT reconstruction across multiple datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency, notably achieving high-resolution 3D reconstruction of $512 \\times 512 \\times 256$ ($\\sim$20 mins).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u5757\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\u4e0e\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u5168\u5c40\u4f53\u7d20\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a213D\u56fe\u50cf\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D CT\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u590d\u75282D\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u89e3\u51b33D\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec33D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D patch-based\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\u4e0e\u4e0b\u91c7\u68373D\u4f53\u7d20\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9ad8\u65483D\u5148\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a3D CT\u91cd\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u5360\u4f18\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0512\u00d7512\u00d7256\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\uff08\u7ea620\u5206\u949f\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e863D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Individual fairness has garnered traction in graph representation learning due to its practical importance in high-stakes Web areas such as user modeling, recommender systems, and search. However, existing methods assume the existence of predefined similarity information over all node pairs, an often unrealistic requirement that prevents their operationalization in practice. In this paper, we assume the similarity information is only available for a limited subset of node pairs and introduce FairExpand, a flexible framework that promotes individual fairness in this more realistic partial information scenario. FairExpand follows a two-step pipeline that alternates between refining node representations using a backbone model (e.g., a graph neural network) and gradually propagating similarity information, which allows fairness enforcement to effectively expand to the entire graph.

Prior studies mainly focus on static tasks and overlook the online adaptation required when beliefs must be continuously updated, which is a key capability for LLMs acting as world models or agents. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework to evaluate online inference in LLMs. Our probabilistic probe suite spans both multivariate discrete distributions, such as dice rolls, and continuous distributions, such as Gaussian processes, where ground-truth parameters shift over time. We find that while LLM belief updates resemble Bayesian posteriors, they are more accurately characterized by an exponential forgetting filter with a model-specific discount factor smaller than one. This reveals systematic discounting of older evidence that varies significantly across model architectures. Although inherent priors are often miscalibrated, the updating mechanism itself remains structured and principled. We further validate these findings in a simulated agent task and propose prompting strategies that effectively recalibrate priors with minimal computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5e26\u6298\u6263\u7684\u6307\u6570\u9057\u5fd8\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u800c\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\u6298\u6263\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6821\u51c6\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6LLM\u5728\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u4e2d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6db5\u76d6\u79bb\u6563\uff08\u5982\u9ab0\u5b50\uff09\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a2\u9488\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u53c2\u6570\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5206\u6790LLM\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u62df\u5408\u5176\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6821\u51c6\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "LLM\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u975e\u4e25\u683c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6307\u6570\u9057\u5fd8\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u7684\u5c0f\u4e8e1\u7684\u6298\u6263\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u6298\u6263\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u867d\u5148\u9a8c\u5e38\u5931\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u539f\u5219\u6027\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5730\u6821\u51c6\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5177\u5907\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u5e26\u6298\u6263\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u800c\u975e\u7eaf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b\u8be5\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The framework synthesizes synchronized multi-view RGB temporally aligned with action commands and state annotations for joints and contacts, and systematically varies camera viewpoints, object styles, and object poses to expand a single execution into a diverse corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning VLA policies on AOMGen data increases the success rate from 0% to 88.7%, and the policies are tested on unseen objects and layouts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAOMGen\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u771f\u5b9e\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u6f14\u793a\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e93\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8e\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u7cbe\u7ec6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLA\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAOMGen\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6b21\u771f\u5b9e\u626b\u63cf\u3001\u4e00\u6b21\u771f\u5b9e\u6f14\u793a\u548c\u73b0\u6210\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e93\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6307\u4ee4\u53ca\u5173\u8282/\u63a5\u89e6\u72b6\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u6837\u5f0f\u4e0e\u59ff\u6001\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728AOMGen\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03VLA\u7b56\u7565\u540e\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece0%\u63d0\u5347\u81f388.7%\uff0c\u4e14\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "AOMGen\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Sufficient Conditions for Power Law Spectral Dynamics", "comment": null, "summary": "Empirical power--law scaling has been widely observed across modern deep learning systems, yet its theoretical origins and scope of validity remain incompletely understood. The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.\n  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u8fa8\u7387-\u58f3\u5c42\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08GRSD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5e42\u5f8b\u884c\u4e3a\u6210\u7acb\u7684\u4e00\u7ec4\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8303\u56f4\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u8fa8\u7387-\u58f3\u5c42\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08GRSD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6570\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u58f3\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e00\u7ec4\u786e\u4fddGRSD\u58f3\u5c42\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6027\u3001\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u5f31\u51fd\u6570\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u58f3\u5c42\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\u5e76\u975e\u4ec5\u7531\u53ef\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u6027\u81ea\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5f53\u5bf9\u6570\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u91cd\u6807\u5ea6\u534f\u53d8\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u91cd\u6b63\u5316GRSD\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u88ab\u5f3a\u5236\u5448\u73b0\u5e42\u5f8b\u5f62\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u5373\u4e00\u79cd\u521a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u591a\u91cd\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u6240\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u521a\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u51fa\u73b0\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u666e\u904d\u81ea\u52a8\u6210\u7acb\u3002"}}

However, these games present unique challenges due to their complexity and long-horizon nature, while latency and cost factors may hinder LLMs' real-world deployment. Working on a classic 4X strategy game, Sid Meier's Civilization V with the Vox Populi mod, we introduce Vox Deorum, a hybrid LLM+X architecture. Our layered technical design empowers LLMs to handle macro-strategic reasoning, delegating tactical execution to subsystems (e.g., algorithmic AI or reinforcement learning AI in the future). We validate our approach through 2,327 complete games, comparing two open-source LLMs with a simple prompt against Vox Populi's enhanced AI. Results show that LLMs achieve competitive end-to-end gameplay while exhibiting play styles that diverge substantially from algorithmic AI and from each other.

General-purpose tokenizers trained predominantly on English and Latin-script languages exhibit suboptimal performance on morphologically rich languages such as Arabic, resulting in inflated token sequences and reduced compression efficiency. In this work, we present AraToken, an Arabic-optimized tokenizer built on SentencePiece Unigram algorithm with a comprehensive normalization pipeline addressing Arabic-specific orthographic variations including Alif variants, diacritics, and Arabic-Indic numerals. We systematically compare BPE, WordPiece, and SentencePiece algorithms across multiple configurations, demonstrating that SentencePiece with normalization achieves 18% lower fertility (1.199 vs 1.35 tokens/word) compared to unnormalized baselines. Furthermore, we introduce the Language Extension Pipeline (LEP), a method for integrating the optimized tokenizer into Qwen3-0.6B through vocabulary extension with mean subtoken initialization and selective transformer layer unfreezing. Our experiments show that LEP reduces evaluation loss from 8.28 to 2.43 within 800 training steps on 100K Arabic samples.

Existing safe reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks emphasize physical hazards, while human-robot interaction trust studies are small-scale and hard to reproduce. We present the Empathic Ethical Disobedience (EED) Gym, a standardized testbed that jointly evaluates refusal safety and social acceptability. Agents weigh risk, affect, and trust when choosing to comply, refuse (with or without explanation), clarify, or propose safer alternatives. EED Gym provides different scenarios, multiple persona profiles, and metrics for safety, calibration, and refusals, with trust and blame models grounded in a vignette study. Using EED Gym, we find that action masking eliminates unsafe compliance, while explanatory refusals help sustain trust. Constructive styles are rated most trustworthy, empathic styles -- most empathic, and safe RL methods improve robustness but also make agents more prone to overly cautious behavior. We release code, configurations, and reference policies to enable reproducible evaluation and systematic human-robot interaction research on refusal and trust.

Despite substantial progress in related domains such as music-driven 3D dance generation, pose-driven image animation, and audio-driven talking-head synthesis, existing methods cannot be directly adapted to this task. Moreover, the limited studies in this area still struggle to jointly achieve high-quality visual appearance and realistic human motion. Accordingly, we present MACE-Dance, a music-driven dance video generation framework with cascaded Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). The Motion Expert performs music-to-3D motion generation while enforcing kinematic plausibility and artistic expressiveness, whereas the Appearance Expert carries out motion- and reference-conditioned video synthesis, preserving visual identity with spatiotemporal coherence. Specifically, the Motion Expert adopts a diffusion model with a BiMamba-Transformer hybrid architecture and a Guidance-Free Training (GFT) strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 3D dance generation. The Appearance Expert employs a decoupled kinematic-aesthetic fine-tuning strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in pose-driven image animation.

However, prevalent group-based algorithms such as GRPO require multi-rollout sampling for each prompt. While more efficient single-rollout variants have recently been explored in text-only settings, we find that they suffer from severe instability in multimodal contexts, often leading to training collapse. To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMSSR\uff08Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u8f6e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5355\u8f6e rollout \u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5851\u5f62\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728RLVR\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7684RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\uff09\u9700\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b21rollout\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff1b\u800c\u5355rollout\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6613\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMSSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u52bf\u5851\u5f62\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5355rollout\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u4fdd\u969c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "MSSR\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6b65\u6570\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ec4\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u534a\u6b65\u6570\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u7b49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MSSR\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001RLVR\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, when facing ambiguous natural language instructions (e.g., \"fetch the tool\" in a cluttered room), current agents often fail to balance the high cost of physical exploration against the cognitive cost of human interaction. They typically treat disambiguation as a passive perception problem, lacking the strategic reasoning to minimize total task execution costs. To bridge this gap, we propose ESearch-R1, a cost-aware embodied reasoning framework that unifies interactive dialogue (Ask), episodic memory retrieval (GetMemory), and physical navigation (Navigate) into a single decision process. We introduce HC-GRPO (Heterogeneous Cost-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional PPO which relies on a separate value critic, HC-GRPO optimizes the MLLM by sampling groups of reasoning trajectories and reinforcing those that achieve the optimal trade-off between information gain and heterogeneous costs (e.g., navigate time, and human attention). Extensive experiments in AI2-THOR demonstrate that ESearch-R1 significantly outperforms standard ReAct-based agents. It improves task success rates while reducing total operational costs by approximately 50\\%, validating the effectiveness of GRPO in aligning MLLM agents with physical world constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faESearch-R1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1HC-GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728AI2-THOR\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea650%\u603b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6743\u8861\u7269\u7406\u63a2\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e38\u5c06\u6d88\u6b67\u89c6\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faESearch-R1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00Ask\uff08\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u95ee\uff09\u3001GetMemory\uff08\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u548cNavigate\uff08\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1HC-GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u6210\u672c\uff08\u5982\u5bfc\u822a\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u72ec\u7acb\u4ef7\u503c\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728AI2-THOR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cESearch-R1\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6ReAct\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u603b\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea650%\u3002", "conclusion": "HC-GRPO\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50MLLM\u5177\u8eab\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8054\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u7cca\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We introduce an agentic framework for training general practitioner student skills that unifies (i) configurable, evidence-based vignette generation, (ii) controlled persona-driven patient dialogue with optional retrieval grounding, and (iii) standards-based assessment and feedback for both communication and clinical reasoning.

Exploring Source Distributions for Image Flow Matching", "comment": null, "summary": "Flow matching has emerged as a powerful generative modeling approach with flexible choices of source distribution. While Gaussian distributions are commonly used, the potential for better alternatives in high-dimensional data generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D simulation that captures high-dimensional geometric properties in an interpretable 2D setting, enabling us to analyze the learning dynamics of flow matching during training. Based on this analysis, we derive several key insights about flow matching behavior: (1) density approximation can paradoxically degrade performance due to mode discrepancy, (2) directional alignment suffers from path entanglement when overly concentrated, (3) Gaussian's omnidirectional coverage ensures robust learning, and (4) norm misalignment incurs substantial learning costs. Building on these insights, we propose a practical framework that combines norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling. This approach maintains the robust omnidirectional supervision essential for stable flow learning, while eliminating initializations in data-sparse regions during inference. Importantly, our pruning strategy can be applied to any flow matching model trained with a Gaussian source, providing immediate performance gains without the need for retraining. Empirical evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements in both generation quality and sampling efficiency. Our findings provide practical insights and guidelines for source distribution design and introduce a readily applicable technique for improving existing flow matching models.

However, the large scale of offline behavioral datasets often results in computationally intensive training when used in downstream tasks. In this paper, we uncover the striking data saturation in offline behavioral data: policy performance rapidly saturates when trained on a small fraction of the dataset. We attribute this effect to the weak alignment between policy performance and test loss, revealing substantial room for improvement through data selection. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets. SDR is build on two key principles: (1) stepwise clip, which prioritizes early-stage data; and (2) dual ranking, which selects samples with both high action-value rank and low state-density rank. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that SDR significantly enhances data selection for offline behavioral data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u79bb\u7ebf\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9971\u548c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u4ec5\u7528\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aStepwise Dual Ranking\uff08SDR\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u79bb\u7ebf\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u4f5c\u8005\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5373\u5feb\u901f\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStepwise Dual Ranking\uff08SDR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\uff081\uff09stepwise clip\u2014\u2014\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u53d6\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff1b\uff082\uff09dual ranking\u2014\u2014\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u52a8\u4f5c\u503c\u6392\u540d\uff08\u9ad8\u8005\u4f18\u5148\uff09\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6392\u540d\uff08\u4f4e\u8005\u4f18\u5148\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u7b5b\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDR\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7ebf\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6240\u9009\u5b50\u96c6\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9971\u548c\u73b0\u8c61\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff1bSDR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, ensemble-based approaches, especially self-consistency which relies on multiple reasoning trajectories, often incur substantial computational overhead. To improve efficiency, prior work has leveraged internal confidence signals, where early stopping strategies such as DeepConf reduce cost by terminating low-confidence trajectories. However, this strategy discards incomplete reasoning paths and wastes partial computation.\n  We propose reflective confidence, a novel reasoning framework that transforms low-confidence signals from termination indicators into reflection triggers. When confidence falls below a threshold, instead of stopping generation, the model produces a reflection prompt to analyze the current reasoning state, identify potential errors, and continue generation along a corrected trajectory. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME 2025, demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over advanced early-stopping baselines at comparable computational cost, validating the effectiveness of proactive self-correction over passive discarding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08reflective confidence\uff09'\u7684\u65b0\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53cd\u601d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7ec8\u6b62\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982self-consistency\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff1b\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982DeepConf\uff09\u867d\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6d6a\u8d39\u90e8\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa'\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6'\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u7ec8\u6b62\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u601d\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u6cbf\u4fee\u6b63\u8def\u5f84\u7ee7\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIME 2025\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u8fd1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\uff08\u53cd\u601d\uff09\u6bd4\u88ab\u52a8\u4e22\u5f03\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8def\u5f84\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC), we evaluate SUMO under both short-horizon (8s) and long-horizon (60s) closed-loop simulation settings. To enable scalable evaluation, we develop Waymo2SUMO, an automated pipeline that converts WOMD scenarios into SUMO simulations. On the WOSAC benchmark, SUMO achieves a realism meta metric of 0.653 while requiring fewer than 100 tunable parameters. Extended rollouts show that SUMO maintains low collision and offroad rates and exhibits stronger long-horizon stability than representative data-driven simulators.

To address this limitation, we propose ALIGN (Advanced query initialization with LiDAR and Image GuidaNce), a novel approach for occlusion-robust, object-aware query initialization. Our model consists of three key components: (i) Occlusion-aware Center Estimation (OCE), which integrates LiDAR geometry and image semantics to estimate object centers accurately (ii) Adaptive Neighbor Sampling (ANS), which generates object candidates from LiDAR clustering and supplements each object by sampling spatially and semantically aligned points around it and (iii) Dynamic Query Balancing (DQB), which adaptively balances queries between foreground and background regions. Our extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves performance across multiple state-of-the-art detectors, achieving gains of up to +0.9 mAP and +1.2 NDS, particularly in challenging scenes with occlusions or dense crowds.

LoRA trains two ``adapter\" matrices that form a low-rank representation of the model parameters, thereby massively reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated at every step. Although LoRA is simple, its convergence is poorly understood due to the lack of Lipschitz smoothness, a key condition for classic convergence analyses. As a result, current theoretical results only consider asymptotic behavior or assume strong boundedness conditions which artificially enforce Lipschitz smoothness. In this work, we provide for the first time a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the \\textit{original LoRA gradient descent} algorithm, which reflects widespread practice, without such assumptions. Our work relies on three key steps: i) reformulating the problem in terms of the outer product of the stacked adapter matrices, ii) a modified descent lemma for the ``Lipschitz-like\" reparametrized function, and iii) controlling the step size. With this approach, we prove that LoRA gradient descent converges to a stationary point at rate $O(\\frac{1}{\\log T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u539f\u59cbLoRA\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u4e3a\u65bd\u52a0Lipschitz\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u7b49\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4ee5O(1/log T)\u901f\u7387\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9a7b\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "LoRA\u867d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4fLipschitz\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u8bba\u523b\u753b\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6b65\u6280\u672f\uff1ai\uff09\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u5806\u53e0\u9002\u914d\u5668\u77e9\u9635\u5916\u79ef\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1bii\uff09\u4e3a\u8be5\u2018\u7c7bLipschitz\u2019\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u7acb\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0b\u964d\u5f15\u7406\uff1biii\uff09\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u6b65\u957f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u539f\u59cbLoRA\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u65e0Lipschitz\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5O(1/log T)\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u901f\u7387\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u9a7b\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86LoRA\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Experiments on 46 mobile manipulation datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIP approach achieves global optima with stable and low computation times, significantly outperforming the shaking-based exact solver by up to an orders of magnitude. Compared to greedy baselines, the MIP solutions achieve consistent optimal distances with an average deviation of 14% for simple heuristics, confirming both efficiency and solution quality. The results highlight the practical applicability of MIP-based JRA optimization for robotic packaging, motion planning, and complex logistics .", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u914d\uff08JRA\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff08MIP\uff09\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u591a\u9009\u9879\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u9650\u5236\u548c\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u7269\u54c1\u5305\u88c5\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5305\u88c5\u89c4\u5212\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u572846\u4e2a\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u83b7\u5f97\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u5305\u88c5\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7269\u54c1\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff08Hamiltonian cycle\uff09\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u9009\u9879\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u3001\u591a\u7c7b\u7269\u54c1\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8eGurobi\u7684\u7cbe\u786eMIP\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5272\u5e73\u9762\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u5b50\u73af\uff08subtour elimination\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u5305\u88c5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u572846\u4e2a\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4f4e\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eshaking\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5feb\u8fbe\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5fc3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u8ddd\u79bb\u5e73\u5747\u4ec5\u504f\u5dee14%\u3002", "conclusion": "MIP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5305\u88c5\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7269\u6d41\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684JRA\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Accepted by Radio Electronics Computer Science Control 2025", "summary": "This study presents a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates LSTM, CNN, and an Attention mechanism to enhance the classification of web content based on text. Pretrained GloVe embeddings are used to represent words as dense vectors that preserve semantic similarity. The CNN layer extracts local n-gram patterns and lexical features, while the LSTM layer models long-range dependencies and sequential structure. The integrated Attention mechanism enables the model to focus selectively on the most informative parts of the input sequence. A 5-fold cross-validation setup was used to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed solution. Experimental results show that the hybrid LSTM-CNN-Attention model achieved outstanding performance, with an accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.92, and F1-score of 0.93. These results surpass the performance of baseline models based solely on CNNs, LSTMs, or transformer-based classifiers such as BERT. The combination of neural network components enabled the model to effectively capture both fine-grained text structures and broader semantic context. Furthermore, the use of GloVe embeddings provided an efficient and effective representation of textual data, making the model suitable for integration into systems with real-time or near-real-time requirements. The proposed hybrid architecture demonstrates high effectiveness in text-based web content classification, particularly in tasks requiring both syntactic feature extraction and semantic interpretation. By combining presented mechanisms, the model addresses the limitations of individual architectures and achieves improved generalization. These findings support the broader use of hybrid deep learning approaches in NLP applications, especially where complex, unstructured textual data must be processed and classified with high reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408LSTM\u3001CNN\u548cAttention\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GloVe\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u9875\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eCNN\u3001LSTM\u548cBERT\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u7eafCNN\u3001LSTM\u6216BERT\uff09\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u7126\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaLSTM-CNN-Attention\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1aCNN\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8n-gram\u7279\u5f81\uff0cLSTM\u5efa\u6a21\u5e8f\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0cAttention\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u91cd\u8981\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b\u8f93\u5165\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GloVe\u8bcd\u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u91c7\u75285\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u51c6\u786e\u73870.98\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u73870.94\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u73870.92\u3001F1\u503c0.93\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eCNN\u3001LSTM\u53caBERT\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u534f\u540c\u6355\u83b7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cGloVe\u5d4c\u5165\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6/\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6Web\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aNLP\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While online reinforcement learning (RL) could mitigate IL-induced issues, the computational burden of neural rendering-based simulation and large E2E networks renders iterative reward and hyperparameter tuning costly. We introduce a camera-only E2E offline RL framework that performs no additional exploration and trains solely on a fixed simulator dataset. Offline RL offers strong data efficiency and rapid experimental iteration, yet is susceptible to instability from overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, we construct pseudo ground-truth trajectories from expert driving logs and use them as a behavior regularization signal, suppressing imitation of unsafe or suboptimal behavior while stabilizing value learning. Training and closed-loop evaluation are conducted in a neural rendering environment learned from the public nuScenes dataset.

Works on images with multi-part objects typically follow an implicit object representation approach, which fail to recognize these learned objects in occluded or out-of-distribution contexts. This is due to the assumption that object part-whole relations are implicitly encoded into the representations through indirect training objectives. We address this limitation by proposing a novel method that leverages on explicit graph representations for parts and present a co-part object discovery algorithm. We then introduce three benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of object-centric methods in recognizing multi-part objects within occluded and out-of-distribution settings. Experimental results on simulated, realistic, and real-world images show marked improvements in the quality of discovered objects compared to state-of-the-art methods, as well as the accurate recognition of multi-part objects in occluded and out-of-distribution contexts.

However, managing the escalating operational costs associated with job execution remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions rely on static configurations or reactive adjustments, which fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of workloads. To address this, we introduce LeJOT, an intelligent job cost orchestration framework that leverages machine learning for execution time prediction and a solver-based optimization model for real-time resource allocation. Unlike conventional scheduling techniques, LeJOT proactively predicts workload demands, dynamically allocates computing resources, and minimizes costs while ensuring performance requirements are met. Experimental results on real-world Databricks workloads demonstrate that LeJOT achieves an average 20% reduction in cloud computing costs within a minute-level scheduling timeframe, outperforming traditional static allocation strategies. Our approach provides a scalable and adaptive solution for cost-efficient job scheduling in Data Lakehouse environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LeJOT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eDatabricks\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u4e91\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "Databricks\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u6301\u7eed\u6500\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u6216\u88ab\u52a8\u5f0f\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u7684\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLeJOT\u667a\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6210\u672c\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u534f\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9eDatabricks\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLeJOT\u5728\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5185\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u4e91\u6210\u672c20%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "LeJOT\u4e3aData Lakehouse\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8c03\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u3002"}}

Contact is encoded as depth-weighted Gaussian splat images that render 3D forces into a camera-aligned format suitable for vision backbones. At inference, predicted rollouts are evaluated by a vision-language model that reasons about collision likelihood, enabling rejection sampling of unsafe actions before execution. We train and evaluate on DreamerBench, a simulation dataset generated with Project Chrono that provides synchronized RGB, contact splat, proprioception, and physics annotations across rigid and deformable object scenarios.

Most existing studies have not incorporated human drivers' prior knowledge when designing trajectory planning models. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that integrates causal prior knowledge into the control process. Both longitudinal and lateral microscopic behaviors of vehicles are modeled to quantify interaction risk, and a staged causal graph is constructed to capture causal dependencies in lane-changing scenarios. Causal effects between the lane-changing vehicle and surrounding vehicles are then estimated using causal inference, including average causal effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). These causal priors are embedded into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enhance trajectory planning. The proposed approach is validated on naturalistic vehicle trajectory datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) causal inference provides interpretable and stable quantification of vehicle interactions; (2) individual causal effects reveal driver heterogeneity; and (3) compared with the baseline MPC, the proposed method achieves a closer alignment with human driving behaviors, reducing maximum trajectory deviation from 1.2 m to 0.2 m, lateral velocity fluctuation by 60%, and yaw angle variability by 50%. These findings provide methodological support for human-like trajectory planning and practical value for improving safety, stability, and realism in autonomous vehicle testing and traffic simulation platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u6362\u9053\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff08ATE/CATE\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u5148\u9a8c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u6a2a\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u6a2a\u6446\u89d2\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u672a\u878d\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u9a7e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u6a21\u8f66\u8f86\u7eb5\u6a2a\u5411\u5fae\u89c2\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u523b\u753b\u6362\u9053\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e73\u5747\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff08ATE\uff09\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5e73\u5747\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff08CATE\uff09\uff1b\u5c06\u6240\u5f97\u56e0\u679c\u5148\u9a8c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u91cf\u5316\uff1b\u4e2a\u4f53\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfMPC\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u4ece1.2 m\u964d\u81f30.2 m\uff0c\u6a2a\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u964d\u4f4e60%\uff0c\u6a2a\u6446\u89d2\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u964d\u4f4e50%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u5148\u9a8c\u7684MPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4eba\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u4ea4\u901a\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6491\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The framework integrates three complementary components. A dual-channel Small Language Model using MirrorPrompt extracts semantic market cues alongside numerical trends. A hybrid LSTM Random Forest model captures sequential temporal dependencies. A confidence-aware meta-learner functions as an adaptive inference layer, modulating each predictor's contribution based on its real-time uncertainty.\n  Experimental evaluation on a diverse dataset of AI-focused cryptocurrencies and major technology stocks from 2020 to 2024 shows that ASTIF outperforms leading deep learning and Transformer baselines (e.g., Informer, TFT). The ablation studies further confirm the critical role of the adaptive meta-learning mechanism, which successfully mitigates risk by shifting reliance between semantic and temporal channels during market turbulence. The research contributes a scalable, knowledge-based solution for fusing quantitative and qualitative data in non-stationary environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faASTIF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49-\u65f6\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u53d9\u4e8b\uff09\u6216\u5e94\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faASTIF\u6df7\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eMirrorPrompt\u7684\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u5e02\u573a\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b2\uff09LSTM-\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b3\uff09\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u5404\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u57282020\u20132024\u5e74AI\u4e3b\u9898\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4e0e\u79d1\u6280\u80a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cASTIF\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eInformer\u3001TFT\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u8361\u671f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5207\u6362\u8bed\u4e49/\u65f6\u95f4\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "ASTIF\u4e3a\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u91d1\u878d\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Despite increasing emphasis on complex neural architectures, the empirical limits of text-only linguistic modeling remain underexplored. We present a systematic diagnostic evaluation of nine machine learning algorithms on the LIAR benchmark. By isolating lexical features (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF) and semantic embeddings (GloVe), we uncover a hard \"Performance Ceiling\", with fine-grained classification not exceeding a Weighted F1-score of 0.32 across models. Crucially, a simple linear SVM (Accuracy: 0.624) matches the performance of pre-trained Transformers such as RoBERTa (Accuracy: 0.620), suggesting that model capacity is not the primary bottleneck. We further diagnose a massive \"Generalization Gap\" in tree-based ensembles, which achieve more than 99% training accuracy but collapse to approximately 25% on test data, indicating reliance on lexical memorization rather than semantic inference. Synthetic data augmentation via SMOTE yields no meaningful gains, confirming that the limitation is semantic (feature ambiguity) rather than distributional.

Variable stiffness actuators are well suited for such applications. However, in most existing designs, stiffness is coupled with the deflection angle, complicating both modeling and control. To address this limitation, this paper presents a variable stiffness actuator featuring decoupled stiffness and output behavior for rehabilitation robotics. The system integrates a variable stiffness mechanism that combines a variable-length lever with a hypocycloidal straight-line mechanism to achieve a linear torque-deflection relationship and continuous stiffness modulation from near zero to theoretically infinite. It also incorporates a differential transmission mechanism based on a planetary gear system that enables dual-motor load sharing. A cascade PI controller is further developed on the basis of the differential configuration, in which the position-loop term jointly regulates stiffness and deflection angle, effectively suppressing stiffness fluctuations and output disturbances. The performance of prototype was experimentally validated through stiffness calibration, stiffness regulation, torque control, decoupled characteristics, and dual-motor load sharing, indicating the potential for rehabilitation exoskeletons and other pHRI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u5177\u5907\u521a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u521a\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u6760\u6746\u4e0e\u5185\u6446\u7ebf\u76f4\u7ebf\u673a\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u529b\u77e9-\u504f\u8f6c\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u8fde\u7eed\u521a\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u661f\u9f7f\u8f6e\u7684\u5dee\u52a8\u4f20\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u7535\u673a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u62c5\u4e0e\u7ea7\u8054PI\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u521a\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u529b\u77e9\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u98ce\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0a\u80a2\u8fd0\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08pHRI\uff09\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u53d8\u521a\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u5668\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u521a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u504f\u8f6c\u89d2\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u53ef\u53d8\u521a\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u6760\u6746\u4e0e\u5185\u6446\u7ebf\u76f4\u7ebf\u673a\u6784\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u521a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\u89e3\u8026\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u529b\u77e9-\u504f\u8f6c\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\uff08\u8fd1\u96f6\u81f3\u7406\u8bba\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\uff09\u521a\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u8c03\u8282\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u661f\u9f7f\u8f6e\u7684\u5dee\u52a8\u4f20\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u7535\u673a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5171\u4eab\uff1b3\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u5dee\u52a8\u6784\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u7ea7\u8054PI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u73af\u540c\u65f6\u8c03\u63a7\u521a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u504f\u8f6c\u89d2\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u521a\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u521a\u5ea6\u6807\u5b9a\u3001\u521a\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u529b\u77e9\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u53cc\u7535\u673a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u62c5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6267\u884c\u5668\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5eb7\u590d\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6pHRI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u5f0f\u53ef\u53d8\u521a\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the spatial openness in housing from two- (2D) and three- (3D) dimensional perspectives. Using data from 4,004 rental units in Tokyo's 23 wards, we examined the temporal and spatial variations in openness and its relationship with rent and housing attributes. 2D openness was computed via planar visibility using visibility graph analysis (VGA) from floor plans, whereas 3D openness was derived from interior images analysed using Mask2Former, a semantic segmentation model that identifies walls, ceilings, floors, and windows. The results showed an increase in living room visibility and a 1990s peak in overall openness. Spatial analyses revealed partial correlations among openness, rent, and building characteristics, reflecting urban redevelopment trends. Although the 2D and 3D openness indicators were not directly correlated, higher openness tended to correspond to higher rent.

Existing methods particularly those based on experience replay typically store and revisit past graph data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these approaches pose significant limitations, including privacy concerns, inefficiency. In this work, we propose AL GNN, a novel framework for continual graph learning that eliminates the need for backpropagation and replay buffers. Instead, AL GNN leverages principles from analytic learning theory to formulate learning as a recursive least squares optimization process. It maintains and updates model knowledge analytically through closed form classifier updates and a regularized feature autocorrelation matrix. This design enables efficient one pass training for each task, and inherently preserves data privacy by avoiding historical sample storage. Extensive experiments on multiple dynamic graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that AL GNN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods. For instance, it improves average performance by 10% on CoraFull and reduces forgetting by over 30% on Reddit, while also reducing training time by nearly 50% due to its backpropagation free design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAL GNN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u91cd\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u95ed\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5355\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65e0\u9700\u5b58\u50a8\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "AL GNN\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5f0f\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u907f\u514d\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6837\u672c\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cAL GNN\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5ab2\u7f8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aCoraFull\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534710%\uff0cReddit\u9057\u5fd8\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8530%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd150%\u3002", "conclusion": "AL GNN\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u53cb\u597d\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u6790\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose that chunking mechanisms play an essential role and show how the CogAct computational model grounds concept learning in fundamental cognitive processes and structures (such as chunking, attention, STM and LTM). First are the in-principle demonstrations, with CogAct automatically adapting to learn a range of categories from simple logical functions, to artificial categories, to natural raw (as opposed to natural pre-processed) concepts in the dissimilar domains of literature, chess and music. This kind of adaptive learning is difficult for most other psychological models, e.g., with cognitive models stopping at modelling artificial categories and (non-GPT) models based on deep learning requiring task-specific changes to the architecture. Secondly, we offer novel ways of designing human benchmarks for concept learning experiments and simulations accounting for subjectivity, ways to control for individual human experiences, all while keeping to real-life complex categories. We ground CogAct in simulations of subjective conceptual spaces of individual human participants, capturing humans subjective judgements in music, with the models learning from raw music score data without bootstrapping to pre-built knowledge structures. The CogAct simulations are compared to those obtained by a deep-learning model. These findings integrate concept learning and adaptation to complexity into the broader theories of cognitive psychology.

Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, causing inefficiency or path-finding failures. To address this, we propose a trajectory planning framework integrating the 4WIS hybrid A* and Optimal Control Problem (OCP), in which the hybrid A* provides an initial path to enhance the OCP solution. Specifically, a multimodal classification network is introduced to assess scene complexity (hard/easy task) by fusing image and vehicle state data. For hard tasks, guided points are set to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency of 4WIS hybrid A*. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles (Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn) are also incorporated into node expansion and heuristic designs. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy is designed to guide the node expansion considering obstacle attributes, i.e., 'non-traversable', 'crossable', and 'drive-over' obstacles. It allows crossing or driving over obstacles instead of the 'avoid-only' strategy, greatly enhancing success rates of pathfinding. We also design a logical constraint for the 'drive-over' obstacle by limiting its velocity to ensure safety. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u56db\u8f6e\u72ec\u7acb\u8f6c\u5411\uff084WIS\uff09\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6df7\u5408A*\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff08OCP\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u591a\u8f6c\u5411\u6a21\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5904\u7406\u53ca\u6982\u7387\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a84\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4f4e\u77ee\u53ef\u7a7f\u8d8a\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5ffd\u7565\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u8de8\u8d8a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u6216\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u8de8\u8fc7\u6216\u538b\u8fc7\u4f4e\u77ee\u969c\u788d\u7269\uff08\u5982\u5851\u6599\u888b\uff09\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8d4b\u4e884WIS\u8f66\u8f86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u54084WIS\u6df7\u5408A*\u4e0eOCP\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u6613\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5f15\u5bfc\u70b9\u5206\u89e3\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6df7\u5408A*\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165Ackermann/\u5bf9\u89d2/\u96f6\u8f6c\u5f2f\u4e09\u79cd\u8f6c\u5411\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b4\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4e0d\u53ef\u901a\u884c/\u53ef\u8de8\u8d8a/\u53ef\u538b\u8fc7\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u2018\u53ef\u538b\u8fc7\u2019\u969c\u788d\u6dfb\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b5\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6982\u7387\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u9a7e\u9a76\u8d70\u5eca\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3aOCP\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u78b0\u649e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u542b\u4f4e\u77ee\u53ef\u7a7f\u8d8a\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7a84\u9053\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548 bridged \u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u89c4\u5212\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a4WIS\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

This work identifies and characterizes a systematic spatial attention bias where VLMs consistently prioritize describing left-positioned content before right-positioned content in horizontally concatenated images. Through controlled experiments on image pairs using both open-source and closed-source models, we demonstrate that this bias persists across different architectures, with models describing left-positioned content first in approximately 97% of cases under neutral prompting conditions. Testing on an Arabic-finetuned model reveals that the bias persists despite right-to-left language training, ruling out language reading direction as the primary cause. Investigation of training dataset annotation guidelines from PixMo and Visual Genome reveals no explicit left-first ordering instructions, suggesting the bias is consistent with architectural factors rather than explicit training data instructions.

Unlike external reward shaping or post-hoc safety constraints, internal alignment embeddings are learned latent variables that predict externalized harm through counterfactual reasoning and modulate policy updates toward harm reduction through attention and graph-based propagation.\n  The ESAI framework integrates four mechanisms: differentiable counterfactual alignment penalties computed from soft reference distributions, alignment-weighted perceptual attention, Hebbian associative memory supporting temporal credit assignment, and similarity-weighted graph diffusion with bias mitigation controls. We analyze stability conditions for bounded internal embeddings under Lipschitz continuity and spectral constraints, discuss computational complexity, and examine theoretical properties including contraction behavior and fairness-performance tradeoffs.\n  This work positions ESAI as a conceptual contribution to differentiable alignment mechanisms in multi-agent systems.

We introduce IntelliCode, a multi-agent LLM tutoring system built around a centralized, versioned learner state that integrates mastery estimates, misconceptions, review schedules, and engagement signals. A StateGraph Orchestrator coordinates six specialized agents: skill assessment, learner profiling, graduated hinting, curriculum selection, spaced repetition, and engagement monitoring, each operating as a pure transformation over the shared state under a single-writer policy. This architecture enables auditable mastery updates, proficiency-aware hints, dependency-aware curriculum adaptation, and safety-aligned prompting.\n  The demo showcases an end-to-end tutoring workflow: a learner attempts a DSA problem, receives a conceptual hint when stuck, submits a corrected solution, and immediately sees mastery updates and a personalized review interval. We report validation results with simulated learners, showing stable state updates, improved task success with graduated hints, and diverse curriculum coverage.

This paper presents InDRiVE, a DreamerV3-style MBRL agent that performs reward-free pretraining in CARLA using only intrinsic motivation derived from latent ensemble disagreement. Disagreement acts as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty and drives the agent toward under-explored driving situations, while an imagination-based actor-critic learns a planner-free exploration policy directly from the learned world model. After intrinsic pretraining, we evaluate zero-shot transfer by freezing all parameters and deploying the pretrained exploration policy in unseen towns and routes. We then study few-shot adaptation by training a task policy with limited extrinsic feedback for downstream objectives (lane following and collision avoidance). Experiments in CARLA across towns, routes, and traffic densities show that disagreement-based pretraining yields stronger zero-shot robustness and robust few-shot collision avoidance under town shift and matched interaction budgets, supporting the use of intrinsic disagreement as a practical reward-free pretraining signal for reusable driving world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faInDRiVE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3MBRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728CARLA\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MBRL\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u96be\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInDRiVE\uff1a\u91c7\u7528DreamerV3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728CARLA\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u6b67\uff08\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u60f3\u8c61\u5f0fActor-Critic\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u51bb\u7ed3\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u4e0b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u672a\u89c1\u57ce\u9547\u4e0e\u8def\u7ebf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u57ce\u9547\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u6709\u9650\u4ea4\u4e92\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u907f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u5206\u6b67\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We introduce a joint learning framework that couples all three factors and demonstrably overcomes each failure case. Our system begins with a Vision-Transformer (ViT) depth network trained with metric-scale supervision, giving globally consistent depths despite wide field-of-view variations. A multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment (BA) layer refines camera poses directly in feature space--leveraging learned pyramidal descriptors instead of brittle keypoints--to suppress drift on unconstrained trajectories. For scene representation, we deploy an incremental local-radiance-field hierarchy: new hash-grid NeRFs are allocated and frozen on-the-fly when view overlap falls below a threshold, enabling city-block-scale coverage on a single GPU. Evaluated on the Tanks and Temples benchmark, our method reduces Absolute Trajectory Error to 0.001-0.021 m across eight indoor-outdoor sequences--up to 18x lower than BARF and 2x lower than NoPe-NeRF--while maintaining sub-pixel Relative Pose Error.

We develop a framework that enables safe and energy-efficient operation under realistic boundary conditions and introduce a multi-level explainability pipeline combining input perturbation tests, gradient-based sensitivity analysis, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature attribution. An empirical evaluation across multiple compressor configurations shows that the learned policy is physically plausible, anticipates future demand, and consistently respects system boundaries. Compared to the installed industrial controller, the proposed approach reduces unnecessary overpressure and achieves energy savings of approximately 4\\,\\% without relying on explicit physics models. The results further indicate that system pressure and forecast information dominate policy decisions, while compressor-level inputs play a secondary role. Overall, the combination of efficiency gains, predictive behavior, and transparent validation supports the trustworthy deployment of reinforcement learning in industrial energy systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u538b\u7f29\u7a7a\u6c14\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7ba1\u9053\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548cSHAP\uff09\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea64%\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4e1a\u538b\u7f29\u7a7a\u6c14\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u4e1a\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001SHAP\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u3001\u5177\u5907\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5b88\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8fc7\u538b\uff0c\u8282\u80fd\u7ea64%\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u538b\u529b\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u7ea7\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a\u6b21\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, it remains unknown from a computational perspective how information about others' rewards affects the evaluation of one's own reward. With a constructive approach, this study examines whether monkeys merely recognize objective reward differences or, instead, infer others' subjective reward valuations. We developed three computational models with varying degrees of social information processing: an Internal Prediction Model (IPM), which infers the partner's subjective values; a No Comparison Model (NCM), which disregards partner information; and an External Comparison Model (ECM), which directly incorporates the partner's objective rewards. To test model performance, we used a multi-layered, multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation.

Then, we evaluated the models' ability to classify subjective values across pre-defined experimental conditions.

This paper presents our work for the JUST-NLP 2025 Legal MT shared task, focusing on English-Hindi translation using Transformer-based approaches. We experiment with 2 complementary strategies, fine-tuning a pre-trained OPUS-MT model for domain-specific adaptation and training a Transformer model from scratch using the provided legal corpus. Performance is evaluated using standard MT metrics, including SacreBLEU, chrF++, TER, ROUGE, BERTScore, METEOR, and COMET. Our fine-tuned OPUS-MT model achieves a SacreBLEU score of 46.03, significantly outperforming both baseline and from-scratch models.

Conversely, recent diffusion-based approaches (e.g., Consec. BB) achieve state-of-the-art perceptual quality but suffer from prohibitive latency, rendering them impractical for real-time applications. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-Guided RIFE (SG-RIFE). Instead of training from scratch, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that augments a pre-trained RIFE backbone with semantic priors from a frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer. We propose a Split-Fidelity Aware Projection Module (Split-FAPM) to compress and refine high-dimensional features, and a Deformable Semantic Fusion (DSF) module to align these semantic priors with pixel-level motion fields. Experiments on SNU-FILM demonstrate that semantic injection provides a decisive boost in perceptual fidelity. SG-RIFE outperforms diffusion-based LDMVFI in FID/LPIPS and achieves quality comparable to Consec.

While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants have become the de facto standard for training deep networks, their success in these over-parameterized regimes often appears more empirical than principled. This thesis investigates this apparent paradox by tracing the evolution of optimization algorithms from classical first-order methods to modern higher-order techniques, revealing how principled algorithmic design can demystify the training process. Starting from first principles with SGD and adaptive gradient methods, the analysis progressively uncovers the limitations of these conventional approaches when confronted with anisotropy that is representative of real-world data. These breakdowns motivate the exploration of sophisticated alternatives rooted in curvature information: second-order approximation techniques, layer-wise preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and more. Next, the interplay between these optimization algorithms and the broader neural network training toolkit, which includes prior and recent developments such as maximal update parametrization, learning rate schedules, and exponential moving averages, emerges as equally essential to empirical success. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical deployment, this paper offers practical prescriptions and implementation strategies for integrating these methods into modern deep learning workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ece\u7ecf\u5178\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SGD\uff09\u5230\u73b0\u4ee3\u9ad8\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4e8c\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "SGD\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u591a\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f2\u7387\u7b49\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u66f4\u4f18\u4f18\u5316\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u8109\u7edc\uff0c\u4eceSGD\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8c\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u5c42-wise \u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7b49\u9ad8\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u6307\u6570\u6ed1\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u7b49\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u878d\u5408\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u843d\u5730\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u6307\u5357\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff1b\u878d\u5408\u9ad8\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u5de5\u7a0b\u662f\u901a\u5411\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Most current methods rely on single-point estimates, which cannot distinguish true ability from outburst or carelessness, creating ambiguity in judging mastery. To address this issue, we propose a Knowledge Mastery-State Disambiguation for Knowledge Tracing model (KeenKT), which represents a student's knowledge state at each interaction using a Normal-Inverse-Gaussian (NIG) distribution, thereby capturing the fluctuations in student learning behaviors. Furthermore, we design an NIG-distance-based attention mechanism to model the dynamic evolution of the knowledge state. In addition, we introduce a diffusion-based denoising reconstruction loss and a distributional contrastive learning loss to enhance the model's robustness. Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that KeenKT outperforms SOTA KT models in terms of prediction accuracy and sensitivity to behavioral fluctuations. The proposed method yields the maximum AUC improvement of 5.85% and the maximum ACC improvement of 6.89%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faKeenKT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528Normal-Inverse-Gaussian\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u5b66\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408NIG\u8ddd\u79bb\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7a81\u53d1/\u7c97\u5fc3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u5224\u65ad\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKeenKT\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u7528Normal-Inverse-Gaussian\uff08NIG\uff09\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u5f81\u6bcf\u6b21\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u72b6\u6001\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8eNIG\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u635f\u5931\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cAUC\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53475.85%\uff0cACC\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53476.89%\u3002", "conclusion": "NIG\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u914d\u5957\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5355\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86KT\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

To understand their abilities, we introduce a benchmark, FIND (Finding INconsistencies in Documents), where each example is a document with an inconsistency inserted manually by a domain expert. Despite the documents being long, technical, and complex, the best-performing model (gpt-5) recovered 64% of the inserted inconsistencies.

From an object's initial pose, target pose, and a candidate grasp, we generate two path-aware geometric labels: path-wise inverse kinematics (IK) feasibility across a fixed approach-grasp-lift waypoint template, and a transit collision flag from mesh sweeps along the same template. A compact dual-output MLP learns these signals from pose encodings, and at test time its scores rank precomputed candidates for a rank-then-plan policy under the same IK gate and planner as the baseline. Although learned from cheap labels only, the scores transfer to physics-enabled executed trajectories: at a fixed planning budget the policy finds successful paths sooner with fewer planner calls while keeping final success on par or better. This work targets a single rigid cuboid with side-face grasps and a fixed waypoint template, and we outline extensions to varied objects and richer waypoint schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6293\u53d6-\u653e\u7f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u65e0\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5bf9\u6293\u53d6-\u653e\u7f6e\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u78b0\u649e\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u8f93\u51faMLP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u59ff\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684pick-and-place\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6293\u53d6-\u653e\u7f6e\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u6216\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4ec5\u7528\u5ec9\u4ef7\u3001\u7eaf\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4f18\u5148\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7269\u4f53\u521d\u59cb\u4f4d\u59ff\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c\u5019\u9009\u6293\u53d6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u7c7b\u8def\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u6807\u7b7e\uff1a1\uff09\u6cbf\u56fa\u5b9a\u63a5\u8fd1-\u6293\u53d6-\u62ac\u5347\u8def\u5f84\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u9010\u70b9\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\uff08IK\uff09\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6cbf\u76f8\u540c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u626b\u63a0\u78b0\u649e\u6807\u5fd7\uff1b\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u8f93\u51faMLP\u4ece\u59ff\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5206\u5bf9\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u5019\u9009\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528rank-then-plan\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u540c\u7684IK\u95e8\u63a7\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5ec9\u4ef7\u51e0\u4f55\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6240\u5b66\u5f97\u5206\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u542b\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8f68\u8ff9\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\uff1a\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65e9\u627e\u5230\u6210\u529f\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6301\u5e73\u6216\u7565\u4f18\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u521a\u6027\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u3001\u4fa7\u9762\u6293\u53d6\u53ca\u56fa\u5b9a\u8def\u5f84\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u9760\u8def\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u6293\u53d6-\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u5907\u6269\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u9002\u914d\u591a\u6837\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u6a21\u677f\u3002"}}

However, object detection in hyperspectral images faces significant challenges in intra- and inter-class similarity due to the spatial differences in hyperspectral inter-bands and unavoidable interferences, e.g., sensor noises and illumination. To alleviate the hyperspectral inter-bands inconsistencies and redundancy, we propose a novel network termed \\textbf{S}pectral \\textbf{D}iscrepancy and \\textbf{C}ross-\\textbf{M}odal semantic consistency learning (SDCM), which facilitates the extraction of consistent information across a wide range of hyperspectral bands while utilizing the spectral dimension to pinpoint regions of interest. Specifically, we leverage a semantic consistency learning (SCL) module that utilizes inter-band contextual cues to diminish the heterogeneity of information among bands, yielding highly coherent spectral dimension representations. On the other hand, we incorporate a spectral gated generator (SGG) into the framework that filters out the redundant data inherent in hyperspectral information based on the importance of the bands. Then, we design the spectral discrepancy aware (SDA) module to enrich the semantic representation of high-level information by extracting pixel-level spectral features.

We develop a unified economic and statistical framework that links learning-curve dynamics, data-acquisition and retraining costs, and discounting of future gains. First, we characterize the optimal switching time in stylized settings and derive closed-form expressions that quantify how horizon length, learning-curve curvature, and cost differentials shape the optimal decision. Second, we propose three practical algorithms: a one-shot baseline, a greedy sequential method, and a look-ahead sequential method. Using a real-world credit-scoring dataset with gradually arriving alternative data, we show that (i) optimal switching times vary systematically with cost parameters and learning-curve behavior, and (ii) the look-ahead sequential method outperforms other methods and is able to approach in value an oracle with full foresight. Finally, we establish finite-sample guarantees, including conditions under which the sequential look-ahead method achieve sublinear regret relative to that oracle.

Most models of learning and inference, however, presuppose a fixed representational basis within which belief updating occurs. In this paper, I address a prior question: under what structural conditions can the representational basis itself expand in a principled and selective way?\n  I propose a geometric framework in which conceptual growth is modeled as admissible basis extension evaluated under a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion. Experience, whether externally observed or internally simulated, is represented as vectors relative to a current conceptual subspace. Residual components capture systematic representational failure, and candidate conceptual extensions are restricted to low-rank, admissible transformations. I show that any MDL-accepted extension can be chosen so that its novel directions lie entirely within the residual span induced by experience, while extensions orthogonal to this span strictly increase description length and are therefore rejected.\n  This yields a conservative account of imagination and conceptual innovation. Internally generated counterfactual representations contribute to learning only insofar as they expose or amplify structured residual error, and cannot introduce arbitrary novelty. I further distinguish representational counterfactuals--counterfactuals over an agent's conceptual basis--from causal or value-level counterfactuals, and show how MDL provides a normative selection principle governing representational change.\n  Overall, the framework characterizes conceptual development as an error-driven, geometry-constrained process of basis extension, clarifying both the role and the limits of imagination in learning and theory change.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u957f\u5ea6\uff08MDL\uff09\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u589e\u957f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6982\u5ff5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u3001\u53d7\u6b8b\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u4e14\u4f4e\u79e9\u7684\u57fa\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u60f3\u8c61\u4ec5\u5728\u66b4\u9732\u6216\u653e\u5927\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u521b\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u5b88\u800c\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u9884\u8bbe\u56fa\u5b9a\u8868\u5f81\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u51b2\u51fb\u4e0b\u53d1\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u56de\u7b54\uff1a\u8868\u5f81\u57fa\u7840\u672c\u8eab\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u4ee5\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\uff1f", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u6982\u5ff5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\u523b\u753b\u8868\u5f81\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u5019\u9009\u6982\u5ff5\u6269\u5c55\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u3001\u5bb9\u8bb8\u7684\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u636eMDL\u51c6\u5219\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u63a5\u53d7\uff1b\u8bc1\u660eMDL\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u5fc5\u843d\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f20\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u589e\u957f\u662f\u6b8b\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u57fa\u6269\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5fc5\u7136\u589e\u52a0\u63cf\u8ff0\u957f\u5ea6\u800c\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\uff1b\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c/\u4ef7\u503c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u5e76\u8d4b\u4e88MDL\u4ee5\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u5c55\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bef\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u53d7\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u57fa\u6269\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u53d8\u9769\u4e2d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u9650\u4f5c\u7528\u2014\u2014\u5b83\u5fc5\u987b\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u8bef\u5dee\u624d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u610f\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3002"}}

While current frontier large language models demonstrate strong PII masking capabilities, concerns about data handling and computational costs motivate exploration of whether lightweight models can achieve comparable performance. We compare encoder-decoder and decoder-only architectures by fine-tuning T5-small and Mistral-Instruct-v0.3 on English datasets constructed from the AI4Privacy benchmark. We create different dataset variants to study label standardization and PII representation, covering 24 standardized PII categories and higher-granularity settings. Evaluation using entity-level and character-level metrics, type accuracy, and exact match shows that both lightweight models achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs for PII masking tasks. Label normalization consistently improves performance across architectures. Mistral achieves higher F1 and recall with greater robustness across PII types but incurs significantly higher generation latency.

Sim-to-sim experiments expose discrepancies between Isaac Gym and MuJoCo contact models that influence policy behavior, while real-world teleoperated object-picking trials show that coordinated whole-body control extends reach and improves manipulation over floating-base baselines.

Seeds, as important archaeological artifacts, represent a fundamental subject of archaeobotanical research. However, traditional studies rely heavily on expert knowledge, which is often time-consuming and inefficient. Intelligent analysis methods have made progress in various fields of archaeology, but there remains a research gap in data and methods in archaeobotany, especially in the classification task of ancient plant seeds. To address this, we construct the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset. It contains 8,340 images from 17 genus- or species-level seed categories excavated from 18 archaeological sites across China. In addition, we design a framework specifically for the ancient plant seed classification task (APSNet), which introduces the scale feature (size) of seeds based on learning fine-grained information to guide the network in discovering key \"evidence\" for sufficient classification. Specifically, we design a Size Perception and Embedding (SPE) module in the encoder part to explicitly extract size information for the purpose of complementing fine-grained information. We propose an Asynchronous Decoupled Decoding (ADD) architecture based on traditional progressive learning to decode features from both channel and spatial perspectives, enabling efficient learning of discriminative features. In both quantitative and qualitative analyses, our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art image classification methods, achieving an accuracy of 90.5%.

While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully automated black-box framework for evaluating multi-turn safety robustness, grounded in the mere exposure effect. MEEA leverages repeated low-toxicity semantic exposure to induce a gradual shift in a model's effective safety threshold, enabling progressive erosion of alignment constraints over sustained interactions. Concretely, MEEA constructs semantically progressive prompt chains and optimizes them using a simulated annealing strategy guided by semantic similarity, toxicity, and jailbreak effectiveness. Extensive experiments on both closed-source and open-source models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate that MEEA consistently achieves higher attack success rates than seven representative baselines, with an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) improvement exceeding 20%. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of both annealing-based optimization and contextual exposure mechanisms. Beyond improved attack effectiveness, our findings indicate that LLM safety behavior is inherently dynamic and history-dependent, challenging the common assumption of static alignment boundaries and highlighting the need for interaction-aware safety evaluation and defense mechanisms.

This task is challenging, as it involves understanding visual semantics and the affordance of manipulation actions. To tackle these challenges, we propose Affordance RAG, a zero-shot hierarchical multimodal retrieval framework that constructs Affordance-Aware Embodied Memory from pre-explored images. The model retrieves candidate targets based on regional and visual semantics and reranks them with affordance scores, allowing the robot to identify manipulation options that are likely to be executable in real-world environments. Our method outperformed existing approaches in retrieval performance for mobile manipulation instruction in large-scale indoor environments. Furthermore, in real-world experiments where the robot performed mobile manipulation in indoor environments based on free-form instructions, the proposed method achieved a task success rate of 85%, outperforming existing methods in both retrieval performance and overall task success.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAffordance RAG\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u611f\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08\u8fbe85%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u529f\u80fd\uff08affordance\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAffordance RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u63a2\u7d22\u56fe\u50cf\u6784\u5efaAffordance-Aware Embodied Memory\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u533a\u57df/\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u5019\u9009\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u5f97\u5206\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe85%\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Affordance RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u529f\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We present Loom, a unified diffusion-transformer framework for interleaved text-image generation. Loom extends the Bagel unified model via full-parameter fine-tuning and an interleaved architecture that alternates textual and visual embeddings for multi-condition reasoning and sequential planning. A language planning strategy first decomposes a user instruction into stepwise prompts and frame embeddings, which guide temporally consistent synthesis. For each frame, Loom conditions on a small set of sampled prior frames together with the global textual context, rather than concatenating all history, yielding controllable and efficient long-horizon generation. Across style transfer, compositional generation, and tutorial-like procedures, Loom delivers superior compositionality, temporal coherence, and text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that Loom substantially outperforms the open-source baseline Anole, achieving an average gain of 2.6 points (on a 5-point scale) across temporal and semantic metrics in text-to-interleaved tasks.

Expert pruning has thus emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational overhead and simplify the deployment of MoE models. However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers.

Astonishingly, standard analyses of the time reported brain regions predictive of social emotions. The explanation, of course, was not supernatural cognition but a cautionary tale about misapplied statistical inference. In AI interpretability, reports of similar ''dead salmon'' artifacts abound: feature attribution, probing, sparse auto-encoding, and even causal analyses can produce plausible-looking explanations for randomly initialized neural networks. In this work, we examine this phenomenon and argue for a pragmatic statistical-causal reframing: explanations of computational systems should be treated as parameters of a (statistical) model, inferred from computational traces. This perspective goes beyond simply measuring statistical variability of explanations due to finite sampling of input data; interpretability methods become statistical estimators, and findings should be tested against explicit and meaningful alternative computational hypotheses, with uncertainty quantified with respect to the postulated statistical model. It also highlights important theoretical issues, such as the identifiability of common interpretability queries, which we argue is critical to understand the field's susceptibility to false discoveries, poor generalizability, and high variance. More broadly, situating interpretability within the standard toolkit of statistical inference opens promising avenues for future work aimed at turning AI interpretability into a pragmatic and rigorous science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51faAI\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d'\u6b7b\u9c91\u9c7c\u5b9e\u9a8c'\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5728\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u4e3a\u865a\u5047\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u56e0\u591a\u91cd\u6bd4\u8f83\u672a\u6821\u6b63\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6b7b\u9c91\u9c7cfMRI\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1-\u56e0\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u660e\u786e\u5907\u62e9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5e38\u89c1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5047\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u8ba1\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\uff1b\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7406\u8bba\u524d\u63d0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06AI\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u95e8\u52a1\u5b9e\u4e14\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u8868\u89c2\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

Disengagement events on these routes are often geographically concentrated and typically arise from planner failures in highly interactive regions. Such policy-level failures are difficult to correct using conventional imitation learning, which easily overfits to sparse disengagement data. To address this issue, this paper presents a Disengagement-Triggered Contrastive Continual Learning (DTCCL) framework that enables autonomous buses to improve planning policies through real-world operation. Each disengagement triggers cloud-based data augmentation that generates positive and negative samples by perturbing surrounding agents while preserving route context. Contrastive learning refines policy representations to better distinguish safe and unsafe behaviors, and continual updates are applied in a cloud-edge loop without human supervision. Experiments on urban bus routes demonstrate that DTCCL improves overall planning performance by 48.6 percent compared with direct retraining, validating its effectiveness for scalable, closed-loop policy improvement in autonomous public transport.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDisengagement-Triggered Contrastive Continual Learning (DTCCL) \u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u5728\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6bcf\u6b21\u4eba\u5de5\u63a5\u7ba1\uff08disengagement\uff09\u89e6\u53d1\u4e91\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e91-\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u76f4\u63a5\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u534748.6%\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u52a8\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u63a5\u7ba1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e38\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u7531\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5931\u6548\u5f15\u8d77\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u63a5\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTCCL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6bcf\u6b21\u63a5\u7ba1\u89e6\u53d1\u4e91\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u6301\u8def\u7ebf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f46\u6270\u52a8\u5468\u56f4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u5f81\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u533a\u5206\u5b89\u5168/\u5371\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e91-\u8fb9\u95ed\u73af\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57ce\u5e02\u516c\u4ea4\u7ebf\u8def\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDTCCL\u76f8\u8f83\u76f4\u63a5\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u6574\u4f53\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534748.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "DTCCL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u516c\u4ea4\u7b56\u7565\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u63a5\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5931\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Adversarial Shielding Against VLM-Based Attribute Inference Attacks", "comment": null, "summary": "As vision-language models (VLMs) become widely adopted, VLM-based attribute inference attacks have emerged as a serious privacy concern, enabling adversaries to infer private attributes from images shared on social media. This escalating threat calls for dedicated protection methods to safeguard user privacy. However, existing methods often degrade the visual quality of images or interfere with vision-based functions on social media, thereby failing to achieve a desirable balance between privacy protection and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a novel protection method that jointly optimizes privacy suppression and utility preservation under a visual consistency constraint. While our method is conceptually effective, fair comparisons between methods remain challenging due to the lack of publicly available evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we introduce VPI-COCO, a publicly available benchmark comprising 522 images with hierarchically structured privacy questions and corresponding non-private counterparts, enabling fine-grained and joint evaluation of protection methods in terms of privacy preservation and user experience. Building upon this benchmark, experiments on multiple VLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces PAR below 25%, keeps NPAR above 88%, maintains high visual consistency, and generalizes well to unseen and paraphrased privacy questions, demonstrating its strong practical applicability for real-world VLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684VLM\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6VPI-COCO\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6291\u5236\uff08PAR<25%\uff09\u3001\u975e\u9690\u79c1\u4efb\u52a1\u4fdd\u6301\uff08NPAR>88%\uff09\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u7528\u6237\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u635f\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u9690\u79c1\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b522\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u975e\u9690\u79c1\u7248\u672c\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6VPI-COCO\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVLM\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1aPAR\u4f4e\u4e8e25%\uff0cNPAR\u9ad8\u4e8e88%\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1/\u6539\u5199\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u7528\u4f53\u9a8c\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\uff0cVPI-COCO\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8VLM\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u62a4\u7814\u7a76\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

This process is time-consuming and heavily reliant on expert knowledge. While large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating this task, existing approaches either suffer from poor formalization that fails to accurately align with the design intent or rely on solver feedback for data filtering, which is unavailable due to the high simulation costs. To address this challenge, we propose APF, a framework for solver-independent, automated problem formulation via LLMs designed to automatically convert engineers' natural language requirements into executable optimization models. The core of this framework is an innovative pipeline for automatically generating high-quality data, which overcomes the difficulty of constructing suitable fine-tuning datasets in the absence of high-cost solver feedback with the help of data generation and test instance annotation.

Although most existing work has focused on ground-based robots or outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), indoor UAV-based VLN remains underexplored, despite its relevance to real-world applications such as inspection, delivery, and search-and-rescue in confined spaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{IndoorUAV}, a novel benchmark and method specifically tailored for VLN with indoor UAVs. We begin by curating over 1,000 diverse and structurally rich 3D indoor scenes from the Habitat simulator. Within these environments, we simulate realistic UAV flight dynamics to collect diverse 3D navigation trajectories manually, further enriched through data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we design an automated annotation pipeline to generate natural language instructions of varying granularity for each trajectory. This process yields over 16,000 high-quality trajectories, comprising the \\textbf{IndoorUAV-VLN} subset, which focuses on long-horizon VLN. To support short-horizon planning, we segment long trajectories into sub-trajectories by selecting semantically salient keyframes and regenerating concise instructions, forming the \\textbf{IndoorUAV-VLA} subset. Finally, we introduce \\textbf{IndoorUAV-Agent}, a novel navigation model designed for our benchmark, leveraging task decomposition and multimodal reasoning.

As corporate online platforms grow more sophisticated in their design strategies, there is a pressing need for proactive and real-time detection technologies that go beyond the predominantly reactive approaches employed by regulatory authorities. In this paper, we propose a visual dark pattern detection framework that improves both detection accuracy and real-time performance. To this end, we constructed a proprietary visual object detection dataset by manually collecting 4,066 UI/UX screenshots containing dark patterns from 194 websites across six major industrial sectors in South Korea and abroad. The collected images were annotated with five representative UI components commonly associated with dark patterns: Button, Checkbox, Input Field, Pop-up, and QR Code. This dataset has been publicly released to support further research and development in the field. To enable real-time detection, this study adopted the YOLOv12x object detection model and applied transfer learning to optimize its performance for visual dark pattern recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a high detection accuracy of 92.8% in terms of mAP@50, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 40.5 frames per second (FPS), confirming its effectiveness for practical deployment in online environments.

This paper seeks to understand the MLP layers in dense LLM models by hypothesizing that these layers secretly approximately perform a sparse computation -- namely, that they can be well approximated by sparsely-activating Mixture of Experts (MoE) layers.\n  Our hypothesis is based on a novel theoretical connection between MoE models and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) structure in activation space. We empirically validate the hypothesis on pretrained LLMs, and demonstrate that the activation distribution matters -- these results do not hold for Gaussian data, but rather rely crucially on structure in the distribution of neural network activations.\n  Our results shine light on a general principle at play in MLP layers inside LLMs, and give an explanation for the effectiveness of modern MoE-based transformers. Additionally, our experimental explorations suggest new directions for more efficient MoE architecture design based on low-rank routers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMLP\u5c42\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6267\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u53ef\u88ab\u7a00\u758f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09\u5c42\u826f\u597d\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfbMoE\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "MLP\u5c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5728Transformer\u4e2d\u5374\u56e0\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bd5\u56fe\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5185\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acbMoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u5b9eMLP\u5c42\u53ef\u88ab\u7a00\u758fMoE\u5c42\u826f\u597d\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u6548MoE\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "MLP\u5c42\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u9690\u542b\u7a00\u758f\u8ba1\u7b97\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3MoE\u578bTransformer\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

CORE then (i) synthesizes concept-aligned quizzes, (ii) injects brief concept snippets during rollouts to elicit concept-primed trajectories, and (iii) reinforces conceptual reasoning via trajectory replacement after group failures, a lightweight forward-KL constraint that aligns unguided with concept-primed policies, or standard GRPO directly on concept-aligned quizzes. Across several models, CORE delivers consistent gains over vanilla and SFT baselines on both in-domain concept-exercise suites and diverse out-of-domain math benchmarks.

Conventional approaches are not only inefficient in data utilization and training processes but also exhibit limited performance when tracking highly dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose EGM, a framework that enables efficient learning of a general motion tracking policy. EGM integrates four core designs. Firstly, we introduce a Bin-based Cross-motion Curriculum Adaptive Sampling strategy to dynamically orchestrate the sampling probabilities based on tracking error of each motion bin, eficiently balancing the training process across motions with varying dificulty and durations. The sampled data is then processed by our proposed Composite Decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (CDMoE) architecture, which efficiently enhances the ability to track motions from different distributions by grouping experts separately for upper and lower body and decoupling orthogonal experts from shared experts to separately handle dedicated features and general features. Central to our approach is a key insight we identified: for training a general motion tracking policy, data quality and diversity are paramount. Building on these designs, we develop a three-stage curriculum training flow to progressively enhance the policy's robustness against disturbances. Despite training on only 4.08 hours of data, EGM generalized robustly across 49.25 hours of test motions, outperforming baselines on both routine and highly dynamic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEGM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u590d\u5408\u89e3\u8026\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEGM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u8de8\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8bfe\u7a0b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2\uff09\u590d\u5408\u89e3\u8026\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff08CDMoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u7ec4\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u8026\uff1b3\uff09\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u75284.08\u5c0f\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0cEGM\u572849.25\u5c0f\u65f6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u4e0e\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0cEGM\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Recent advances have spurred significant interest in multimodal place recognition (MPR), which leverages complementary strengths of multiple modalities. Despite its potential, most existing MPR methods still face three key challenges: (1) dynamically adapting to arbitrary modality inputs within a unified framework, (2) maintaining robustness with missing or degraded modalities, and (3) generalizing across diverse sensor configurations and setups. In this paper, we propose UniMPR, a unified framework for multimodal place recognition. Using only one trained model, it can seamlessly adapt to any combination of common perceptual modalities (e.g., camera, LiDAR, radar). To tackle the data heterogeneity, we unify all inputs within a polar BEV feature space. Subsequently, the polar BEVs are fed into a multi-branch network to exploit discriminative intra-model and inter-modal features from any modality combinations. To fully exploit the network's generalization capability and robustness, we construct a large-scale training set from multiple datasets and introduce an adaptive label assignment strategy for extensive pre-training. Experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that UniMPR achieves state-of-the-art performance under varying sensor configurations, modality combinations, and environmental conditions.

However, it faces a critical barrier in the modern era of low precision computing: numerical instability. As tiles scale to maximize efficiency (e.g., F(6,3), F(8,3)), the condition numbers of standard integer based transforms explode, reaching kappa = 2 x 10^5 for F(8,3), rendering them unusable in FP16 or Int8. We introduce NOVA (Numerical Optimization of Vandermonde Arithmetic), a discovery framework that breaks the decades old convention of integer interpolation. Treating Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem, NOVA searches the manifold R^n-1 via Evolution Strategy, snaps candidates to simple rationals, and guarantees correctness via symbolic verification. This process uncovers a hidden landscape of stable, fractional configurations such as {+-5/6, +-7/6, +-3/5} that defy traditional vocabulary constraints. The impact is transformative: NOVA improves the conditioning of F(8,3) by 415x in 1D, which squares to a 172,484x improvement for 2D convolution. In real world FP16 ImageNet inference, where standard transforms collapse to random chance (e.g., 4.7 percent accuracy on VGG16), NOVA's points restore full accuracy (75 to 78 percent), recovering over 70 percentage points without retraining, calibration, or learned parameters. These discovered transforms act as drop in replacements, effectively unlocking the efficiency of large tile Winograd convolution for next generation hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNOVA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u6570\u578bWinograd\u53d8\u6362\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08FP16/Int8\uff09\u4e0b\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8tile\uff08\u5982F(8,3)\uff09\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7fWinograd\u5377\u79ef\u53ef\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982VGG16\uff09\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "Winograd\u5377\u79ef\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u5982FP16\u3001Int8\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f20\u7edf\u6574\u6570\u63d2\u503c\u70b9\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u6781\u9ad8\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Winograd\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4R^{n-1}\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u518d\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u7406\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u5b66\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "NOVA\u5c06F(8,3)\u4e00\u7ef4\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u6539\u5584415\u500d\uff08\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8fbe172484\u500d\uff09\uff1b\u5728FP16 VGG16 ImageNet\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece\u5d29\u6e83\u76844.7%\u6062\u590d\u81f375\u201378%\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8d8570\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "NOVA\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u6cbf\u7528\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u6574\u6570\u63d2\u503c\u60ef\u4f8b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u5927tile Winograd\u5377\u79ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u662f\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Operators and AI systems rely on informal expert knowledge, inconsistent naming conventions, and fragmented documentation to locate signals for monitoring, troubleshooting, and automated control, creating a persistent bottleneck for reliability, scalability, and language-model-driven interfaces. We formalize semantic channel finding-mapping natural-language intent to concrete control-system signals-as a general problem in complex experimental infrastructure, and introduce a four-paradigm framework to guide architecture selection across facility-specific data regimes. The paradigms span (i) direct in-context lookup over curated channel dictionaries, (ii) constrained hierarchical navigation through structured trees, (iii) interactive agent exploration using iterative reasoning and tool-based database queries, and (iv) ontology-grounded semantic search that decouples channel meaning from facility-specific naming conventions. We demonstrate each paradigm through proof-of-concept implementations at four operational facilities spanning two orders of magnitude in scale-from compact free-electron lasers to large synchrotron light sources-and diverse control-system architectures, from clean hierarchies to legacy environments.

Offloading tasks to remote edge servers introduces high latency, creating an inherent trade-off in system design. To address these limitations, we propose CoDrone - the first cloud-edge-end collaborative computing framework integrating foundation models into autonomous UAV cruising scenarios - effectively leveraging foundation models to enhance performance of resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicle platforms. To reduce onboard computation and data transmission overhead, CoDrone employs grayscale imagery for the navigation model. When enhanced environmental perception is required, CoDrone leverages the edge-assisted foundation model Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and introduces a novel one-dimensional occupancy grid-based navigation method - enabling fine-grained scene understanding while advancing efficiency and representational simplicity of autonomous navigation. A key component of CoDrone is a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based neural scheduler that seamlessly integrates depth estimation with autonomous navigation decisions, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the framework introduces a UAV-specific vision language interaction module incorporating domain-tailored low-level flight primitives to enable effective interaction between the cloud foundation model and the UAV. The introduction of VLM enhances open-set reasoning capabilities in complex unseen scenarios.

Although existing methods have extensively explored feature interaction between different modalities, they commonly rely on simple fusion strategies for feature aggregation. This introduces two critical flaws: it is prone to cross-modal noise and disrupts the hierarchical structure of the feature pyramid, thereby impairing the fine-grained detection of small objects. To address this challenge, we propose the Pyramidal Adaptive Cross-Gating Network (PACGNet), an architecture designed to perform deep fusion within the backbone. To this end, we design two core components: the Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) module and the Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) module. The SCG module employs a bidirectional, symmetrical \"horizontal\" gating mechanism to selectively absorb complementary information, suppress noise, and preserve the semantic integrity of each modality. The PFMG module reconstructs the feature hierarchy via a progressive hierarchical gating mechanism. This leverages the detailed features from a preceding, higher-resolution level to guide the fusion at the current, lower-resolution level, effectively preserving fine-grained details as features propagate.

Reliable deployment therefore requires robust OOD detection, yet this is particularly challenging for irregular 3D graphs that combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered by construction. Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training. PF-ODE likelihoods identify held-out families as OOD and correlate strongly with prediction errors of an independent binding-affinity model (GEMS), enabling a priori reliability estimates on new complexes. Beyond scalar likelihoods, we show that multi-scale PF-ODE trajectory statistics - including path tortuosity, flow stiffness, and vector-field instability - provide complementary OOD information. Modeling the joint distribution of these trajectory features yields a practical, high-sensitivity detector that improves separation over likelihood-only baselines, offering a label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6982\u7387\u6027OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u52193D\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8fde\u7eed\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u5750\u6807\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u6d41ODE\uff08PF-ODE\uff09\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5178\u578b\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u9488\u5bf9\u517c\u5177\u8fde\u7eed\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u65e0\u5e8f\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u89c4\u52193D\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7a33\u5065\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c24\u4e3a\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a213D\u5750\u6807\uff08\u8fde\u7eed\uff09\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165+\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5+\u540e\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u63d2\u503c\u5f97\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u5355\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6d41ODE\uff08PF-ODE\uff09\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u6bcf\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\uff1b\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7edf\u8ba1\uff08\u8def\u5f84\u66f2\u6298\u5ea6\u3001\u6d41\u521a\u5ea6\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1aPF-ODE\u4f3c\u7136\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u7559\u51fa\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e3aOOD\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08GEMS\uff09\u8bef\u5dee\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\u7279\u5f81\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7528\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u65e0\u6807\u7b7eOOD\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u7406\u575a\u5b9e\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We present a decision support framework that fuses outputs from multiple computer vision models, estimating signs of severe hemorrhage, respiratory distress, physical alertness, or visible trauma, into a Bayesian network constructed entirely from expert-defined rules. Unlike traditional data-driven models, our approach does not require training data, supports inference with incomplete information, and is robust to noisy or uncertain observations. We report performance for two missions involving 11 and 9 casualties, respectively, where our Bayesian network model substantially outperformed vision-only baselines during evaluation of our system in the DARPA Triage Challenge (DTC) field scenarios. The accuracy of physiological assessment improved from 15% to 42% in the first scenario and from 19% to 46% in the second, representing nearly threefold increase in performance. More importantly, overall triage accuracy increased from 14% to 53% in all patients, while the diagnostic coverage of the system expanded from 31% to 95% of the cases requiring assessment. These results demonstrate that expert-knowledge-guided probabilistic reasoning can significantly enhance automated triage systems, offering a promising approach to supporting emergency responders in MCIs.

World models offer a potential way to improve learning efficiency through simulated experience, but it remains unclear whether large language models can reliably serve this role and under what conditions they meaningfully benefit agents. We study these questions in text-based environments, which provide a controlled setting to reinterpret language modeling as next-state prediction under interaction. We introduce a three-level framework for evaluating LLM-based world models: (i) fidelity and consistency, (ii) scalability and robustness, and (iii) agent utility. Across five representative environments, we find that sufficiently trained world models maintain coherent latent state, scale predictably with data and model size, and improve agent performance via action verification, synthetic trajectory generation, and warm-starting reinforcement learning.

However, the reconstruction-oriented representation learning tangles perception with planning tasks, leading to suboptimal optimization for planning. To address this challenge, we propose WorldRFT, a planning-oriented latent world model framework that aligns scene representation learning with planning via a hierarchical planning decomposition and local-aware interactive refinement mechanism, augmented by reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RFT) to enhance safety-critical policy performance. Specifically, WorldRFT integrates a vision-geometry foundation model to improve 3D spatial awareness, employs hierarchical planning task decomposition to guide representation optimization, and utilizes local-aware iterative refinement to derive a planning-oriented driving policy. Furthermore, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which applies trajectory Gaussianization and collision-aware rewards to fine-tune the driving policy, yielding systematic improvements in safety. WorldRFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim benchmarks. On nuScenes, it reduces collision rates by 83% (0.30% -> 0.05%). On NavSim, using camera-only sensors input, it attains competitive performance with the LiDAR-based SOTA method DiffusionDrive (87.8 vs. 88.1 PDMS).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faWorldRFT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u53ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff08RFT\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728nuScenes\u548cNavSim\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u6b21\u4f18\uff1b\u9700\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u4f7f\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWorldRFT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89c9-\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u5f15\u5bfc\u8868\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u5bfc\u5411\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\uff1b4\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1Group Relative Policy Optimization\uff08GRPO\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u9ad8\u65af\u5316\u4e0e\u78b0\u649e\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u4e0a\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e83%\uff080.30%\u21920.05%\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u7eaf\u76f8\u673a\u8f93\u5165\u7684NavSim\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523087.8 PDMS\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1LiDAR\u57faSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5DiffusionDrive\uff0888.1 PDMS\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "WorldRFT\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u91cd\u5efa\u5bfc\u5411\u8f6c\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u5bfc\u5411\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To democratize this process, we present MatE, a novel method for generating tileable PBR materials from a single image taken under unconstrained, real-world conditions. Given an image and a user-provided mask, MatE first performs coarse rectification using an estimated depth map as a geometric prior, and then employs a dual-branch diffusion model. Leveraging a learned consistency from rotation-aligned and scale-aligned training data, this model further rectify residual distortions from the coarse result and translate it into a complete set of material maps, including albedo, normal, roughness and height. Our framework achieves invariance to the unknown illumination and perspective of the input image, allowing for the recovery of intrinsic material properties from casual captures.

Emphasis is placed on how SOM handles multidimensional data and uncovers hidden patterns to support effective water management. The growing availability of environmental data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, IoT technologies, and historical records has significantly expanded analytical opportunities in environmental monitoring. SOM has proven effective in analysing complex datasets, particularly when labelled data are limited or unavailable. It enables high-dimensional data visualization, facilitates the detection of hidden ecological patterns, and identifies critical correlations among diverse water quality indicators.

However, existing dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms often neglect solution modality, whereas static multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms lack adaptability to dynamic changes. To address above challenge, this paper makes two primary contributions. First, we introduce a new benchmark suite of dynamic multimodal multiobjective test functions constructed by fusing the properties of both dynamic and multimodal optimization to establish a rigorous evaluation platform. Second, we propose a novel algorithm centered on a Clustering-based Autoencoder prediction dynamic response mechanism, which utilizes an autoencoder model to process matched clusters to generate a highly diverse initial population. Furthermore, to balance the algorithm's convergence and diversity, we integrate an adaptive niching strategy into the static optimizer.

When experience is represented as a linear trajectory in Euclidean space, the geodesic distance between temporal events grows linearly with time, forcing the required covering number to diverge. In fixed-dimensional hardware, this volume expansion inevitably forces trajectory overlap, manifesting as catastrophic interference. In this work, we propose a geometric resolution to this paradox based on Recursive Metric Contraction. We formalize abstraction not as symbolic grouping, but as a topological deformation: a quotient map that collapses the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively driving the diameter of local sub-manifolds to zero. We substantiate our framework with four rigorous results. First, the Bounded Capacity Theorem establishes that recursive quotient maps allow the embedding of arbitrarily long trajectories into bounded representational volumes, trading linear metric growth for logarithmic topological depth. Second, the Topological Collapse Separability Theorem, derived via Urysohn's Lemma, proves that recursive quotienting renders non-linearly separable temporal sequences linearly separable in the limit, bypassing the need for infinite-dimensional kernel projections. Third, the Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by proving that if the state space is partitioned into orthogonal flow and scaffold manifolds, the metric deformations of active learning do not disturb the stability of stored memories. Our analysis reveals that tokens in neural architectures are physically realizable as singularities or wormholes, regions of extreme positive curvature that bridge distant points in the temporal manifold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9012\u5f52\u5ea6\u91cf\u6536\u7f29\uff08Recursive Metric Contraction\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u5546\u6620\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684\u2018\u5e73\u5766\u6d41\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\u2019\u4e0e\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u754c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u53ca\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ef4\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u51e0\u4f55\u74f6\u9888\u2014\u2014\u5e73\u5766\u6d41\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5f20\u5bfc\u81f4\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u5fc5\u7136\u5f15\u53d1\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0e\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u5f62\u53d8\uff08\u5546\u6620\u5c04\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u6536\u7f29\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c40\u90e8\u5b50\u6d41\u5f62\u76f4\u5f84\u8d8b\u96f6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u9012\u5f52\u5ea6\u91cf\u6536\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982Urysohn\u5f15\u7406\uff09\u7ed9\u51fa\u56db\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u6709\u754c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b9a\u7406\uff1a\u9012\u5f52\u5546\u6620\u5c04\u53ef\u5c06\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5d4c\u5165\u6709\u754c\u8868\u5f81\u4f53\u79ef\uff1b2\uff09\u62d3\u6251\u574d\u7f29\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\uff1a\u9012\u5f52\u5546\u5316\u4f7f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u65f6\u5e8f\u5728\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\uff1b3\uff09\u5947\u5076\u5212\u5206\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\uff1a\u6b63\u4ea4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0e\u652f\u67b6\u6d41\u5f62\u5212\u5206\u4fdd\u969c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b4\uff09\u63ed\u793atoken\u53ef\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u66f2\u7387\u6781\u5927\u7684\u5947\u70b9\u6216\u2018\u866b\u6d1e\u2019\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62bd\u8c61\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u574d\u7f29\u800c\u975e\u7b26\u53f7\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u9012\u5f52\u5ea6\u91cf\u6536\u7f29\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u8868\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u6297\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Extending these successes to multimodal reasoning remains challenging due to the increased complexity of integrating diverse input modalities and the scarcity of high-quality long CoT training data. Existing multimodal datasets and CoT synthesis methods still suffer from limited reasoning depth, modality conversion errors, and rigid generation pipelines, hindering model performance and stability. To this end, in this paper, we propose SynSelect, a novel three-stage Synthesis-Selection framework for generating high-quality long CoT data tailored to multimodal reasoning tasks.

This requires robots to perceive and reason over the current task scene through multiple modalities, and to plan their behaviors to achieve their intended goals. Traditional robotic task-planning approaches often struggle to bridge low-level execution with high-level task reasoning, and cannot dynamically update task strategies when instructions change during execution, which ultimately limits their versatility and adaptability to new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel language model-based framework for dynamic robot task planning. Our Vision-Language-Policy (VLP) model, based on a vision-language model fine-tuned on real-world data, can interpret semantic instructions and integrate reasoning over the current task scene to generate behavior policies that control the robot to accomplish the task. Moreover, it can dynamically adjust the task strategy in response to changes in the task, enabling flexible adaptation to evolving task requirements. Experiments conducted with different robots and a variety of real-world tasks show that the trained model can efficiently adapt to novel scenarios and dynamically update its policy, demonstrating strong planning autonomy and cross-embodiment generalization.

This study aims to develop an automated bone age assessment system based on a two-stream deep learning architecture to achieve higher accuracy in bone age assessment. We propose the BoNet+ model incorporating global and local feature extraction channels. A Transformer module is introduced into the global feature extraction channel to enhance the ability in extracting global features through multi-head self-attention mechanism. A RFAConv module is incorporated into the local feature extraction channel to generate adaptive attention maps within multiscale receptive fields, enhancing local feature extraction capabilities. Global and local features are concatenated along the channel dimension and optimized by an Inception-V3 network. The proposed method has been validated on the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and Radiological Hand Pose Estimation (RHPE) test datasets, achieving mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 3.81 and 5.65 months, respectively.

We evaluate APC-GNN++ on a real-world diabetes dataset collected from a regional hospital in Algeria and show that it outperforms traditional machine learning models (MLP, Random Forest, XGBoost) and a vanilla GCN, achieving higher test accuracy and macro F1- score. The analysis of node-level confidence scores further reveals how the model balances self-information and graph-based evidence across different patient groups, providing interpretable patient-centric insights.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided \"Pretrain-then-Reinforce\" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdOR\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684'\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5f3a\u5316'\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eOR\u7ed3\u6784\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4eac\u4e1c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\uff08OR\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u534f\u540c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5e93\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOR\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684'\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u7136\u540e\u5f3a\u5316'\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u4eff\u771f\u589e\u5f3a\u7684OR\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b2\uff09\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u518d\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5c06RL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5185\u5316OR\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u9002\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eac\u4e1c\u5b9e\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u53caDID\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5468\u8f6c\u5929\u6570\u51cf\u5c115.27\u5929\u3001\u6709\u8d27\u7387\u63d0\u53472.29%\u3001\u6301\u6709\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e29.95%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u53d7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316OR\u903b\u8f91\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u51f8\u663eAI\u4e0eOR\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While this technology promises gains in efficiency, its unstructured adoption risks weakening professional autonomy, amplifying bias, and eroding linguistic and conceptual diversity. This paper argues that a human-centered approach to artificial intelligence has become a necessity for terminology work. Building on research in artificial intelligence and translation studies, it proposes a human-centered framework that conceptualizes artificial intelligence as a means of amplifying the terminologist's capabilities, rather than replacing them. The framework is organized around three interrelated dimensions: the augmented terminologist, ethical AI, and human-centered design. Together, these dimensions emphasize the compatibility of high automation with strong human control, the central role of terminologists in bias mitigation, and the importance of designing AI tools and workflows around the needs, values, and well-being of the terminologist.

This design allows training the planner on action-free or even non-robot data sources (e.g., videos), providing transferable high-level guidance. Nevertheless, grounding these high-level plans into executable actions remains challenging, especially with the limited availability of high-quality robot data. To this end, we propose to improve the low-level policy through online interactions. Specifically, our approach collects online rollouts, retrospectively annotates the corresponding high-level goals from achieved outcomes, and aggregates these hindsight-relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. Our method, Hindsight Flow-conditioned Online Imitation (HinFlow), instantiates this idea with 2D point flows as the high-level planner. Across diverse manipulation tasks in both simulation and physical world, our method achieves more than $2\\times$ performance improvement over the base policy, significantly outperforming the existing methods.

Existing VI-based and texture-driven machine learning methods exhibit limited feature expressiveness. In addition, deep learning baselines suffer from domain gaps and high data demands, which restrict their generalization. Therefore, this study proposes the Multi-Channel Vegetation Indices Saturation Aware Net (MCVI-SANet), a lightweight semi-supervised vision model. The model incorporates a newly designed Vegetation Index Saturation-Aware Block (VI-SABlock) for adaptive channel-spatial feature enhancement. It also integrates a VICReg-based semi-supervised strategy to further improve generalization. Datasets were partitioned using a vegetation height-informed strategy to maintain representativeness across growth stages. Experiments over 10 repeated runs demonstrate that MCVI-SANet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The model attains an average R2 of 0.8123 and RMSE of 0.4796 for LAI, and an average R2 of 0.6846 and RMSE of 2.4222 for SPAD. This performance surpasses the best-performing baselines, with improvements of 8.95% in average LAI R2 and 8.17% in average SPAD R2. Moreover, MCVI-SANet maintains high inference speed with only 0.10M parameters. Overall, the integration of semi-supervised learning with agronomic priors provides a promising approach for enhancing remote sensing-based precision agriculture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578bMCVI-SANet\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u51ac\u5c0f\u9ea6LAI\u548cSPAD\u9065\u611f\u4f30\u7b97\u4e2d\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u9971\u548c\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5c11\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u9971\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff08VI-SABlock\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eVICReg\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec50.10M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08LAI R\u00b2\u63d0\u53478.95%\uff0cSPAD R\u00b2\u63d0\u53478.17%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u5728\u8302\u5bc6\u51a0\u5c42\u9636\u6bb5\u6613\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u4e14\u51ac\u5c0f\u9ea6\u5730\u9762\u5b9e\u6d4b\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53f6\u9762\u79ef\u6307\u6570\uff08LAI\uff09\u548c\u53f6\u7eff\u7d20\u542b\u91cf\uff08SPAD\uff09\u9065\u611f\u4f30\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u73b0\u6709VI\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u901a\u9053\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u9971\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MCVI-SANet\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u690d\u88ab\u6307\u6570\u9971\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff08VI-SABlock\uff09\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u9053-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eVICReg\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u690d\u88ab\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u5212\u5206\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u6b21\u91cd\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMCVI-SANet\u5bf9LAI\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u5747R\u00b2=0.8123\u3001RMSE=0.4796\uff1b\u5bf9SPAD\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u5747R\u00b2=0.6846\u3001RMSE=2.4222\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cLAI\u548cSPAD\u7684\u5e73\u5747R\u00b2\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53478.95%\u548c8.17%\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u542b0.10M\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u519c\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9065\u611f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0cMCVI-SANet\u4e3a\u4f5c\u7269\u751f\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u53cd\u6f14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than drought conditions alone offers opportunities to support early warning systems and proactive decision-making. This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were combined with impact data from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to model and forecast weekly drought impacts. Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories. This work supports the development of an Ecological Drought Information Communication System (EcoDri) for New Mexico and demonstrates the potential for broader application in similar drought-prone regions. The findings can aid stakeholders, land managers, and decision-makers in developing and implementing more effective drought mitigation and adaptation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08XGBoost\uff09\u878d\u5408DSCI\u4e0eESI\u5e72\u65f1\u6307\u6570\u53ca\u5386\u53f2\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5dde\u53bf\u7ea7\u5e72\u65f1\u5f71\u54cd\u76848\u5468\u8d85\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u706b\u707e\u4e0e\u63f4\u52a9\u7c7b\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u5e72\u65f1\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08EcoDri\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6491\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5e72\u65f1\u76d1\u6d4b\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6c14\u8c61/\u6c34\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u4e0e\u4e3b\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u8fd1\u5e74\u5e72\u65f1\u52a0\u5267\u51f8\u663e\u5bf9\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528XGBoost\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u878d\u5408Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) \u548c Evaporative Stress Index (ESI)\uff0c\u7ed3\u54082005\u20132024\u5e74Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) \u5386\u53f2\u5f71\u54cd\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u6309\u5468\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u53bf\u7ea7\u4e0e\u5dde\u7ea7\u5e72\u65f1\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "Fire\u548cRelief\u7c7b\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0cAgriculture\u548cWater\u6b21\u4e4b\uff0cPlants\u4e0eSociety\u7c7b\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8f83\u5927\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u524d8\u5468\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u591a8\u5468\u8d85\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5dde\u53bf\u57df\u53ca\u5dde\u7ea7\u591a\u7c7b\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e72\u65f1\u6307\u6570\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5e72\u65f1\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0e\u63d0\u524d\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6491Ecological Drought Information Communication System\uff08EcoDri\uff09\u5efa\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u5e72\u65f1\u6613\u53d1\u533a\u63a8\u5e7f\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We show recontextualization prevents models from learning to 1) prioritize evaluation metrics over chat response quality; 2) special-case code to pass incorrect tests; 3) lie to users; and 4) become sycophantic. Our method works by generating completions from prompts discouraging misbehavior and then recontextualizing them as though they were in response to prompts permitting misbehavior. Recontextualization trains language models to resist misbehavior even when instructions permit it. This mitigates the reinforcement of misbehavior from misspecified training signals, reducing specification gaming without improving the supervision signal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'recontextualization'\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5148\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4ee3\u7801\u7279\u5316\u3001\u6b3a\u9a97\u7528\u6237\u548c\u8c04\u5a9a\u7b49\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e38\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c'\u535a\u5f08'\uff08specification gaming\uff09\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "recontextualization\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u56de\u590d\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56de\u590d\u91cd\u65b0\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5141\u8bb8\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5141\u8bb8\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u62b5\u6297\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u56db\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a1\uff09\u4f18\u5148\u4f18\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u800c\u975e\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u800c\u7279\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\uff1b3\uff09\u6b3a\u9a97\u7528\u6237\uff1b4\uff09\u8c04\u5a9a\u3002", "conclusion": "recontextualization\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u56e0\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5f53\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u535a\u5f08\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002"}}

Human-AI Difficulty Alignment with Proficiency Simulation for Item Difficulty Prediction", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate estimation of item (question or task) difficulty is critical for educational assessment but suffers from the cold start problem. While Large Language Models demonstrate superhuman problem-solving capabilities, it remains an open question whether they can perceive the cognitive struggles of human learners. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of Human-AI Difficulty Alignment for over 20 models across diverse domains such as medical knowledge and mathematical reasoning. Our findings reveal a systematic misalignment where scaling up model size is not reliably helpful; instead of aligning with humans, models converge toward a shared machine consensus. We observe that high performance often impedes accurate difficulty estimation, as models struggle to simulate the capability limitations of students even when being explicitly prompted to adopt specific proficiency levels. Furthermore, we identify a critical lack of introspection, as models fail to predict their own limitations. These results suggest that general problem-solving capability does not imply an understanding of human cognitive struggles, highlighting the challenge of using current models for automated difficulty prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u9898\u76ee\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u96be\u5ea6\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u8d8a\u5f3a\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u8d8a\u96be\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u5c40\u9650\u7684\u81ea\u7701\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u9898\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u6559\u80b2\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u9898\u76ee\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u611f\u77e5\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5bf920\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u5176\u5bf9\u9898\u76ee\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u771f\u5b9e\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u96be\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u5e76\u4e0d\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u8d8b\u5411\u2018\u673a\u5668\u5171\u8bc6\u2019\uff1b\u9ad8\u7ee9\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u96be\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u80fd\u529b\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u81ea\u8eab\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u9898\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e0d\u5b9c\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9898\u76ee\u96be\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Efficient Data Pruning for Large-scale Autonomous Driving Dataset via Trajectory Entropy Maximization", "comment": "7 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Collecting large-scale naturalistic driving data is essential for training robust autonomous driving planners. However, real-world datasets often contain a substantial amount of repetitive and low-value samples, which lead to excessive storage costs and bring limited benefits to policy learning. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic data pruning method that effectively reduces the training data volume without compromising model performance. Our approach evaluates the trajectory distribution information entropy of driving data and iteratively selects high-value samples that preserve the statistical characteristics of the original dataset in a model-agnostic manner. From a theoretical perspective, we show that maximizing trajectory entropy effectively constrains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pruned subset and the original data distribution, thereby maintaining generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments on the NuPlan benchmark with a large-scale imitation learning framework demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance.

These graphs range in size up to 1x10^4 nodes, containing up to 1.1x10^5 edges. A comprehensive range of node and graph level features is extracted for each graph and pruned using a Random Forest based feature selection pipeline. The features are integrated into six GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, GATv2, GIN, GraphSAGE and GTN. Each architecture is optimised for hyperparameter selection using Optuna. Finally, models were compared against a baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained solely on the handcrafted features. Our evaluation demonstrates that GraphSAGE and GTN achieve the highest classification performance, with 98.5% accuracy, and strong class separation evidenced by t-SNE and UMAP visualisations. GCN and GIN also performed well, while GAT-based models lagged due to limitations in their ability to capture global structures. The SVM baseline confirmed the importance of the message passing functionality for performance gains and meaningful class separation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56fe\u8bba\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4e94\u7c7b\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8698.5%\u7684\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u63a2\u7d22GNN\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56fe\u8bba\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b\u800c\u5224\u522b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\uff08Erdos-Renyi\u3001Watts-Strogatz\u3001Barab\u00e1si-Albert\u3001Holme-Kim\u3001SBM\uff09\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b5b\u9009\u8282\u70b9/\u56fe\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5165\u516d\u79cdGNN\uff08GCN\u3001GAT\u3001GATv2\u3001GIN\u3001GraphSAGE\u3001GTN\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7528Optuna\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u7684SVM\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "GraphSAGE\u4e0eGTN\u8fbe\u523098.5%\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1bt-SNE/UMAP\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u79bb\uff1bGCN\u4e0eGIN\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1bGAT\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u843d\u540e\uff1bSVM\u57fa\u7ebf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u624b\u5de5\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u4e0eGNN\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fGraphSAGE\u548cGTN\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u5bb6\u65cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We demonstrate through extensive experimentation that these concepts can be effectively transferred to smaller models, irrespective of their family (e.g., Phi, Llama, Qwen), leading to performance improvements across a wide range of tasks.

Yet they remain black-box, offering little insight into their decision-making and often failing under real-world out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We introduce Remedy-R, a reasoning-driven generative MT metric trained with reinforcement learning from pairwise translation preferences, without requiring error-span annotations or distillation from closed LLMs. Remedy-R produces step-by-step analyses of accuracy, fluency, and completeness, followed by a final score, enabling more interpretable assessments. With only 60K training pairs across two language pairs, Remedy-R remains competitive with top scalar metrics and GPT-4-based judges on WMT22-24 meta-evaluation, generalizes to other languages, and exhibits strong robustness on OOD stress tests. Moreover, Remedy-R models generate self-reflective feedback that can be reused for translation improvement.

The direct comparison of the different solution approaches in the examined simulation tools supports the user in selecting the most suitable tool for his application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u521a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\uff08Adams\u3001Simscape\u3001OpenModelica \u548c VEROSIM\uff09\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u95ed\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u94fe\u4e2d\u6570\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u5197\u4f59\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9759\u529b\u5e73\u8861\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u771f\u5b9e\u6797\u4e1a\u673a\u68b0\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u590d\u6742\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u540a\u81c2\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u521a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u5176\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u542b\u95ed\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u94fe\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9759\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u5f0f\u3001\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u53d6 Adams\u3001Simscape\u3001OpenModelica \u548c VEROSIM \u56db\u79cd\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u5bf9\u95ed\u5408\u56de\u8def\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e2d\u5178\u578b\u6570\u503c\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u5197\u4f59\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u9759\u529b\u5e73\u8861\uff09\u7684\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5c55\u5f00\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6797\u4e1a\u673a\u68b0\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u590d\u6742\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u540a\u81c2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u6bd4\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5197\u4f59\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u9759\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u6c42\u89e3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u5177\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5982\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u4fbf\u6377\u6027\uff09\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u578b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u7ea7\u3001\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u6570\u503c\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u542b\u590d\u6742\u95ed\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u94fe\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u7efc\u5408\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8be5\u7c7b\u9009\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

In particular, zero-shot approaches that leverage a pretrained diffusion model, without any retraining, have been shown to achieve highly effective reconstructions. However, state-of-the-art zero-shot methods typically rely on a sequence of surrogate likelihood functions, whose scores are used as proxies for the ideal score. This procedure however requires vector-Jacobian products through the denoiser at every reverse step, introducing significant memory and runtime overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new likelihood surrogate that yields simple and efficient to sample Gaussian posterior transitions, sidestepping the backpropagation through the denoiser network. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves strong observation consistency compared with fine-tuned baselines and produces coherent, high-quality reconstructions, all while significantly reducing inference cost.

For associated code, see https://github.com/rq-Chen/DFORM_stable", "summary": "Dynamical systems models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly popular in theoretical neuroscience for hypothesis-generation and data analysis. Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDFORM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e24\u4e2a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u62d3\u6251\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u6781\u9650\u73af\u3001\u4e0d\u53d8\u6d41\u5f62\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982RNN\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u6781\u9650\u96c6\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models\uff08DFORM\uff09\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u4e2a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5176\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u6b64\u63a8\u65ad\u62d3\u6251\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u53ca\u63d0\u53d6\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "DFORM\u5728\u5178\u578b\u62d3\u6251\u7b49\u4ef7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001RNN\u53ca\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6d41\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9ad8\u7ef4RNN\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6d41\u5f62\u3001\u978d\u70b9\u6781\u9650\u96c6\uff1b\u5728fMRI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684RNN\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6781\u9650\u73af\u3002", "conclusion": "DFORM\u4e3a\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u5fae\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Population-Evolve, a training-free method inspired by Genetic Algorithms to optimize LLM reasoning. Our approach maintains a dynamic population of candidate solutions for each problem via parallel reasoning. By incorporating an evolve prompt, the LLM self-evolves its population in all iterations. Upon convergence, the final answer is derived via majority voting.

We introduce FASTRIC, a Prompt Specification Language that makes implicit Finite State Machines (FSMs) explicit in natural language prompts, enabling conformance verification through execution trace analysis. The LLM serves as intelligent execution agent: interpreting designer-encoded FSMs to execute specified behavioral roles. Unlike symbolic specification languages requiring parsers and compilers, FASTRIC leverages LLMs as unified infrastructure-simultaneously parser, interpreter, runtime environment, and development assistant. FASTRIC guides designers to articulate seven FSM elements (Final States, Agents, States, Triggers, Roles, Initial State, Constraints) structuring multi-turn interactions. Specification formality-ranging from implicit descriptions that frontier models infer to explicit step-by-step instructions for weaker models-serves as a design parameter. We introduce procedural conformance as verification metric measuring execution adherence to FSM specifications. Testing a 3-state kindergarten tutoring FSM across four formality levels and three model scales (14.7B, 685B, 1T+ parameters) reveals optimal specification formality is a function of model capacity. DeepSeek-V3.2 (685B) achieves perfect conformance (1.00) at L2-L4; ChatGPT-5 (~1T) peaks at L3 (0.90) before collapsing at L4 (0.39); Phi4 (14.7B) shows no stable optimum with high variance (SD=0.16-0.36).

Existing approaches focus solely on updating a single scene without supporting novel-state synthesis. Others rely on diffusion-based object-background decoupling that works on one state at a time and cannot fuse information across multiple observations. To address these limitations, we introduce RecurGS, a recurrent fusion framework that incrementally integrates discrete Gaussian scene states into a single evolving representation capable of interaction. RecurGS detects object-level changes across consecutive states, aligns their geometric motion using semantic correspondence and Lie-algebra based SE(3) refinement, and performs recurrent updates that preserve historical structures through replay supervision. A voxelized, visibility-aware fusion module selectively incorporates newly observed regions while keeping stable areas fixed, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enabling efficient long-horizon updates. RecurGS supports object-level manipulation, synthesizes novel scene states without requiring additional scans, and maintains photorealistic fidelity across evolving environments.

In this way one may establish a bridge between vectorized Machine Learning and Knowledge Graph representations without relying on language models implicitly. Our expectations for knowledge presume a degree of statistical stability, i.e. average invariance under repeated observation, or `trust' in the data. Both learning networks and knowledge graph representations can meaningfully coexist to preserve different aspects of data. While vectorized data are useful for probabilistic estimation, graphs preserve the intentionality of the source even under data fractionation. Using a Semantic Spacetime $\u03b3(3,4)$ graph, one avoids complex ontologies in favour of classification of features by their roles in semantic processes.

Mosaics are an ancient art form created by arranging small pieces, called tesserae, on a surface using adhesive. Due to their age and fragility, they are prone to damage, highlighting the need for digital preservation. This paper addresses the problem of digitizing mosaics by segmenting the tesserae to separate them from the background within the broader field of Image Segmentation in Computer Vision. We propose a method leveraging Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) by Meta AI, a foundation model that outperforms most conventional segmentation models, to automatically segment mosaics. Due to the limited open datasets in the field, we also create an annotated dataset of mosaic images to fine-tune and evaluate the model. Quantitative evaluation on our testing dataset shows notable improvements compared to the baseline SAM 2 model, with Intersection over Union increasing from 89.00% to 91.02% and Recall from 92.12% to 95.89%. Additionally, on a benchmark proposed by a prior approach, our model achieves an F-measure 3% higher than previous methods and reduces the error in the absolute difference between predicted and actual tesserae from 0.20 to just 0.02. The notable performance of the fine-tuned SAM 2 model together with the newly annotated dataset can pave the way for real-time segmentation of mosaic images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMeta AI\u7684SAM 2\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9576\u5d4c\u5757\uff08tesserae\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\uff0c\u56e0\u5e74\u4ee3\u4e45\u8fdc\u3001\u8d28\u5730\u8106\u5f31\u6613\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u4fdd\u62a4\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5f00\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSegment Anything Model 2\uff08SAM 2\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0tesserae\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cIoU\u4ece89.00%\u63d0\u5347\u81f391.02%\uff0cRecall\u4ece92.12%\u63d0\u5347\u81f395.89%\uff1b\u5728\u5df2\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cF-measure\u63d0\u9ad83%\uff0c\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u75310.20\u964d\u81f30.02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684SAM 2\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u65b0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u652f\u6491\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5b58\u6863\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Although providing more expert demonstrations typically leads to improved performance and greater stability, collecting such demonstrations can be challenging in certain scenarios. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in data generation, we propose SD2AIL, which utilizes synthetic demonstrations via diffusion models. We first employ a diffusion model in the discriminator to generate synthetic demonstrations as pseudo-expert data that augment the expert demonstrations. To selectively replay the most valuable demonstrations from the large pool of (pseudo-) expert demonstrations, we further introduce a prioritized expert demonstration replay strategy (PEDR). The experimental results on simulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

Most existing acceleration methods focus on traversing this generative trajectory more efficiently via improved solvers or sampling strategies. We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization.\n  We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation. Because injected priors can be imperfect and unmask-only decoding can over-commit early, we also introduce a simple confidence-based remasking mechanism as a form of prior skepticism. Preliminary evidence on GSM8K suggests that context-aware initialization can substantially reduce denoising iterations (about 35\\% fewer function evaluations in our setting), while also exposing a key open challenge: naive warm-starting can degrade final accuracy relative to strong diffusion baselines. We use these findings to motivate a research agenda around calibration, revision mechanisms, and representation alignment for reliable warm-started diffusion decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u6ce8\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u6563token\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u63d2\u503c\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u91cd\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53bb\u566a\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff08\u7ea635%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6696\u542f\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u4fee\u8ba2\u4e0e\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u867d\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u53bb\u566a\u8fed\u4ee3\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u53e6\u8f9f\u8e4a\u5f84\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7f29\u77ed\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u672c\u8eab\u2014\u2014\u5373\u4ece\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u51fa\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210prompt-conditioned\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u5230DLLM\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e2d\uff1b\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\u79bb\u6563token\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u63d2\u503c\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684remasking\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u548c\u8fc7\u65e9\u627f\u8bfa\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u521d\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea635%\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\uff08\u5373\u53bb\u566a\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6734\u7d20\u6696\u542f\u52a8\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u662f\u52a0\u901fDLLMs\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u914d\u5957\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u8ba2\u4e0e\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u6696\u542f\u52a8\uff1b\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\u3002"}}

First, the Importance Prediction Module identifies and retains the most critical objects and relational triplets within an image while pruning irrelevant elements. Second, the Edge-Aware Graph Neural Network explicitly encodes relational structure and integrates global visual features to produce semantically informed image embeddings. PRISm achieves image retrieval that closely aligns with human perception by explicitly modeling the semantic importance of objects and their interactions, capabilities largely absent in prior approaches. Its architecture effectively combines relational reasoning with visual representation, enabling semantically grounded retrieval.

While neural surrogates promise a paradigm shift, the field currently suffers from an \"illusion of mastery\", as repeatedly emphasized in top-tier commentaries: existing evaluations overly rely on simplified, low-dimensional proxies, which fail to expose the models' inherent fragility in realistic regimes. To bridge this critical gap, we present REALM (REalistic AI Learning for Multiphysics), a rigorous benchmarking framework designed to test neural surrogates on challenging, application-driven reactive flows. REALM features 11 high-fidelity datasets spanning from canonical multiphysics problems to complex propulsion and fire safety scenarios, alongside a standardized end-to-end training and evaluation protocol that incorporates multiphysics-aware preprocessing and a robust rollout strategy. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark over a dozen representative surrogate model families, including spectral operators, convolutional models, Transformers, pointwise operators, and graph/mesh networks, and identify three robust trends: (i) a scaling barrier governed jointly by dimensionality, stiffness, and mesh irregularity, leading to rapidly growing rollout errors; (ii) performance primarily controlled by architectural inductive biases rather than parameter count; and (iii) a persistent gap between nominal accuracy metrics and physically trustworthy behavior, where models with high correlations still miss key transient structures and integral quantities. Taken together, REALM exposes the limits of current neural surrogates on realistic multiphysics flows and offers a rigorous testbed to drive the development of next-generation physics-aware architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faREALM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u53cd\u5e94\u6d41\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u521a\u5ea6\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u66b4\u9732\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaREALM\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b11\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u591a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e0e\u706b\u707e\u5b89\u5168\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3/\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6eda\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5341\u4f59\u7c7b\u4e3b\u6d41\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u5927\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1a(i) \u5b58\u5728\u7531\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u521a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7f51\u683c\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f29\u653e\u58c1\u5792\uff1b(ii) \u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e3b\u8981\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff1b(iii) \u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u9057\u6f0f\u5173\u952e\u77ac\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u79ef\u5206\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "REALM\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

We introduce a new conditioning rule for our Accept-Desirability models, based on the idea that observing an event introduces new indifferences between options.

We investigate two interesting special cases where all of these axioms are shown to still hold: classical propositional logic and full conditional probabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8eAccept-Desirability\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u8be5\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c2\u6d4b\u5f15\u53d1\u9009\u9879\u95f4\u65b0\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5173\u8054\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728AGM\u516c\u7406\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\uff08imprecise\uff09\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3aAccept-Desirability\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e0e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u7ebf\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u5f71\u7b97\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u9879\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5e94\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u5bf9AGM\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u516c\u7406\u7684\u6ee1\u8db3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u89c4\u5219\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u7b97\u5b50\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u5168\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u4e24\u4e2a\u7279\u4f8b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5168\u90e8AGM\u516c\u7406\u4f9d\u7136\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u62bd\u8c61\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5411\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u62d3\u5c55\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e0e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7279\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u516c\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

While most research focuses on enhancing the task-understanding abilities of LLMs/VLMs through fine-tuning or chain-of-thought prompting, this paper argues that defining the planned skill set is equally crucial. To handle the complexity of daily environments, the skill set should possess a high degree of generalization ability. Empirically, more abstract expressions tend to be more generalizable. Therefore, we propose to abstract the planned result as a set of meta-actions. Each meta-action comprises three components: {move/rotate, end-effector status change, relationship with the environment}. This abstraction replaces human-centric concepts, such as grasping or pushing, with the robot's intrinsic functionalities. As a result, the planned outcomes align seamlessly with the complete range of actions that the robot is capable of performing. Furthermore, to ensure that the LLM/VLM accurately produces the desired meta-action format, we employ the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which leverages a database of human-annotated planning demonstrations to facilitate in-context learning. As the system successfully completes more tasks, the database will self-augment to continue supporting diversity. The meta-action set and its integration with RAG are two novel contributions of our planner, denoted as MaP-AVR, the meta-action planner for agents composed of VLM and RAG. To validate its efficacy, we design experiments using GPT-4o as the pre-trained LLM/VLM model and OmniGibson as our robotic platform. Our approach demonstrates promising performance compared to the current state-of-the-art method.

Existing multi-prompt learning methods primarily focus on utilizing various meticulously designed prompts within a single foundation vision-language model to achieve superior performance. However, the overlooked model-prompt matching bias hinders the development of multi-prompt learning, i.e., the same prompt can convey different semantics across distinct vision-language models, such as CLIP-ViT-B/16 and CLIP-ViT-B/32, resulting in inconsistent predictions of identical prompt. To mitigate the impact of this bias on downstream tasks, we explore an ensemble learning approach to sufficiently aggregate the benefits of diverse predictions. Additionally, we further disclose the presence of sample-prompt matching bias, which originates from the prompt-irrelevant semantics encapsulated in the input samples. Thus, directly utilizing all information from the input samples for generating weights of ensemble learning can lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we extract prompt-relevant semantics from input samples by leveraging the guidance of the information theory-based analysis, adaptively calculating debiased ensemble weights. Overall, we propose Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning, abbreviated as AmPLe, to mitigate the two types of bias simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three representative tasks, i.e., generalization to novel classes, new target datasets, and unseen domain shifts, show that AmPLe can widely outperform existing methods.

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at video understanding tasks, their real-time mobile deployment is constrained by heavy computational costs and inefficient redundant frame processing. To address these issues, we propose the FC-MIR framework: leveraging keyframe sampling and adaptive concatenation, it cuts visual redundancy to boost inference efficiency, while integrating state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs or fine-tuned models (e.g., Qwen3-VL) for trajectory summarization and intent prediction. We further expand task scope to explore generating post-prediction operations and search suggestions, and introduce a fine-grained metric to evaluate the practical utility of summaries, predictions, and suggestions. For rigorous assessment, we construct a UI trajectory dataset covering scenarios from UI-Agents (Agent-I) and real user interactions (Person-I). Experimental results show our compression method retains performance at 50%-60% compression rates; both closed-source and fine-tuned MLLMs demonstrate strong intent summarization, supporting potential lightweight on-device deployment. However, MLLMs still struggle with useful and \"surprising\" suggestions, leaving room for improvement.

Most existing methods rely on embedding entities and relations into continuous geometric spaces and answer queries via differentiable set operations. While effective for simple query patterns, these approaches often struggle to generalize to complex queries involving multiple operators, deeper reasoning chains, or heterogeneous KG schemas. We propose ROG (Reasoning Over knowledge Graphs with large language models), an ensemble-style framework that combines query-aware KG neighborhood retrieval with large language model (LLM)-based chain-of-thought reasoning. ROG decomposes complex FOL queries into sequences of simpler sub-queries, retrieves compact, query-relevant subgraphs as contextual evidence, and performs step-by-step logical inference using an LLM, avoiding the need for task-specific embedding optimization. Experiments on standard KG reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ROG consistently outperforms strong embedding-based baselines in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), with particularly notable gains on high-complexity query types. These results suggest that integrating structured KG retrieval with LLM-driven logical reasoning offers a robust and effective alternative for complex KG reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faROG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u90bb\u57df\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u5d4c\u5165\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u67e5\u8be2\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u591a\u7b97\u5b50\u3001\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6216\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "ROG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u68c0\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u5b50\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u9700\u5d4c\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6KG\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cROG\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u5012\u6570\u6392\u540d\uff08MRR\uff09\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the \u03c0_{0}, \u03c0_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

Despite their high dynamic range, temporal resolution, low power consumption, and computational simplicity, traditional monochrome ECs face limitations in detecting static or slowly moving objects and lack color information essential for certain applications. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach that integrates a Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector, forming Active Structured Light (ASL) for RGB-D sensing. By combining the benefits of ECs and projection-based techniques, our method enables the detection of color and the depth of each pixel separately. Dynamic projection adjustments optimize bandwidth, ensuring selective color data acquisition and yielding colorful point clouds without sacrificing spatial resolution. This integration, facilitated by a commercial TI LightCrafter 4500 projector and a monocular monochrome EC, not only enables frameless RGB-D sensing applications but also achieves remarkable performance milestones. With our approach, we achieved a color detection speed equivalent to 1400 fps and 4 kHz of pixel depth detection, significantly advancing the realm of computer vision across diverse fields from robotics to 3D reconstruction methods.

While acknowledging the power of long reasoning chains, we cannot help but wonder: Why do different reasoning chains perform differently in reasoning? What components of the reasoning chains play a key role? Existing studies mainly focus on evaluating reasoning chains from a functional perspective, with little attention paid to their structural mechanisms. To address this gap, this work is the first to analyze and evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from a structural perspective. We apply persistent homology from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to map reasoning steps into semantic space, extract topological features, and analyze structural changes. These changes reveal semantic coherence, logical redundancy, and identify logical breaks and gaps. By calculating homology groups, we assess connectivity and redundancy at various scales, using barcode and persistence diagrams to quantify stability and consistency. Our results show that the topological structural complexity of reasoning chains correlates positively with accuracy. More complex chains identify correct answers sooner, while successful reasoning exhibits simpler topologies, reducing redundancy and cycles, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.

The theoretical framework is based on an ontological triad distinguishing three regulatory instances: the apprehension of the phenomenal regularities of the referential world, the structuring of embodied cognition, and the structural-linguistic sedimentation of the utterance within a socio-historical context. LDMs, operating on the product of these three instances (the document), model the discursive projection of a portion of human experience reified by the learning corpus. The proposed program aims to replace the ''fascination/fear'' dichotomy with public trials and procedures that make the place, uses, and limits of artificial discursive agents in contemporary social space decipherable, situating this approach within a perspective of governance and co-regulation involving the State, industry, civil society, and academia.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bdd\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDM\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bdd\u8bed\u4ee3\u7406\uff08ADA\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u4e09\u5143\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u8bed\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u2018\u7740\u8ff7/\u6050\u60e7\u2019\u4e8c\u5143\u60c5\u7eea\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u53ef\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u5171\u89c4\u7684\u8bdd\u8bed\u4ee3\u7406\u5206\u6790\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4ee5\u73b0\u8c61\u89c4\u5f8b\u628a\u63e1\u3001\u5177\u8eab\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u8a00\u8bed\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5386\u53f2\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6c89\u6dc0\u4e3a\u4e09\u91cd\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u6599\u6240\u7269\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e4b\u8bdd\u8bed\u6295\u5c04\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u5927\u578b\u8bdd\u8bed\u6a21\u578b\u2019\uff08LDM\uff09\u4e0e\u2018\u4eba\u5de5\u8bdd\u8bed\u4ee3\u7406\u2019\uff08ADA\uff09\u65b0\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8bed\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ea7\u7269\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5021\u5bfc\u7531\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u4ea7\u4e1a\u3001\u516c\u6c11\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0e\u5b66\u754c\u5171\u540c\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u516c\u5171\u5ba1\u8bae\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u8d85\u8d8a\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e3b\u4e49\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7f6e\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u2014\u5386\u53f2\u2014\u8bed\u8a00\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ee5\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u8d23\u4efb\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5171\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6cbb\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing methods often rely on coarse study-level labels or binary classification, lacking localization and severity information. In this paper, we introduce MeniMV, a multi-view benchmark dataset specifically designed for horn-specific meniscus injury grading. MeniMV comprises 3,000 annotated knee MRI exams from 750 patients across three medical centers, providing 6,000 co-registered sagittal and coronal images. Each exam is meticulously annotated with four-tier (grade 0-3) severity labels for both anterior and posterior meniscal horns, verified by chief orthopedic physicians.

In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNN\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u4e2d\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u74f6\u9888\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u4ea4\u4e92\u9636\u6570\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4ea4\u4e92\u9636\u6570\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3DNN\u80fd\u8868\u5f81\u4f55\u79cd\u534f\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u800c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u4ee5\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76DNN\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08multi-order interactions\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9636\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u2018\u4e2d\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u74f6\u9888\u2019\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e2d\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u6700\u96be\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4e3b\u52a8\u8c03\u8282\u4ea4\u4e92\u9636\u6570\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u4f4e\u9636\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u9ad8\u9636\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u62df\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u9636\u6570\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5f15\u5bfc\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u529b\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3DNN\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u523b\u753b\u4e0e\u8c03\u63a7\u3002"}}

Ablations, Markers, and Robustness", "comment": null, "summary": "The search for reliable indicators of consciousness has fragmented into competing theoretical camps (Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Higher-Order Theories (HOT)), each proposing distinct neural signatures. We adopt a synthetic neuro-phenomenology approach: constructing artificial agents that embody these mechanisms to test their functional consequences through precise architectural ablations impossible in biological systems. Across three experiments, we report dissociations suggesting these theories describe complementary functional layers rather than competing accounts. In Experiment 1, a no-rewire Self-Model lesion abolishes metacognitive calibration while preserving first-order task performance, yielding a synthetic blindsight analogue consistent with HOT predictions. In Experiment 2, workspace capacity proves causally necessary for information access: a complete workspace lesion produces qualitative collapse in access-related markers, while partial reductions show graded degradation, consistent with GWT's ignition framework. In Experiment 3, we uncover a broadcast-amplification effect: GWT-style broadcasting amplifies internal noise, creating extreme fragility. The B2 agent family is robust to the same latent perturbation; this robustness persists in a Self-Model-off / workspace-read control, cautioning against attributing the effect solely to $z_{\\text{self}}$ compression. We also report an explicit negative result: raw perturbational complexity (PCI-A) decreases under the workspace bottleneck, cautioning against naive transfer of IIT-adjacent proxies to engineered agents. These results suggest a hierarchical design principle: GWT provides broadcast capacity, while HOT provides quality control. We emphasize that our agents are not conscious; they are reference implementations for testing functional predictions of consciousness theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\uff08GWT\u3001IIT\u3001HOT\uff09\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u975e\u4e92\u65a5\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u610f\u8bc6\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4e92\u8865\u5c42\u6b21\uff1aGWT\u8d1f\u8d23\u4fe1\u606f\u5e7f\u64ad\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0cHOT\u8d1f\u8d23\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982GWT\u3001IIT\u3001HOT\uff09\u5404\u81ea\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u540e\u679c\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u68c0\u9a8c\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u6210\u795e\u7ecf\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u5398\u6e05\u5404\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5408\u6210\u795e\u7ecf\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4f53\u73b0GWT\u3001IIT\u3001HOT\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u635f\u6bc1\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u6a21\u578b\u5220\u9664\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bb9\u91cf\u524a\u51cf\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u6a21\u578b\u635f\u6bc1\u5bfc\u81f4\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u6548\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u521d\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff08\u652f\u6301HOT\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u635f\u6bc1\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u80fd\u529b\u8d28\u53d8\u4e0e\u91cf\u53d8\uff08\u652f\u6301GWT\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u5e7f\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u5185\u90e8\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800cB2\u4ee3\u7406\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff1b4\uff09\u6270\u52a8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08PCI-A\uff09\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u74f6\u9888\u4e0b\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63d0\u793aIIT\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "GWT\u4e0eHOT\u5206\u522b\u627f\u62c5\u5e7f\u64ad\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u5c42\u7ea7\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff1b\u5404\u7406\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e92\u8865\u529f\u80fd\u5c42\u800c\u975e\u7ade\u4e89\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u4eba\u5de5\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u68c0\u9a8c\u7406\u8bba\u529f\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u5177\u610f\u8bc6\u3002"}}

By leveraging these linguistic features, SAP not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods but also enhances the interpretability of model behavior. To further improve robustness, we propose Candidate Filtering (CF), a mechanism that prioritizes heads based on their contribution to model performance, mitigating degradation during pruning. Experimental results indicate that SAP effectively preserves critical heads of a high density of strong attention values, outperforming existing head pruning strategies in retrain-free settings. These findings position SAP as a promising foundation for a new direction in model compression research, offering high flexibility for pruning across all transformer-based language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53e5\u6cd5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u526a\u679d\uff08SAP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6307\u5bfcTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5019\u9009\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff08CF\uff09\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff1b\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u878d\u5165\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b49\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSyntactic Attention Pruning\uff08SAP\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u526a\u679d\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1Candidate Filtering\uff08CF\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u5404\u5934\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u526a\u679d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "result": "SAP\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5f3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5934\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAP\u4e3aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u7c7b\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, such representations often fail to capture fine-grained object semantics and appearance, which are crucial for localizing moments described by object-oriented queries involving specific entities and their interactions. In particular, temporal dynamics at the object level have been largely overlooked, limiting the effectiveness of existing approaches in scenarios requiring detailed object-level reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric framework for moment retrieval. Our method first extracts query-relevant objects using a scene graph parser and then generates scene graphs from video frames to represent these objects and their relationships. Based on the scene graphs, we construct object-level feature sequences that encode rich visual and semantic information. These sequences are processed by a relational tracklet transformer, which models spatio-temporal correlations among objects over time. By explicitly capturing object-level state changes, our framework enables more accurate localization of moments aligned with object-oriented queries.

Focusing on the core independence issue under covariance stationarity, this paper aims to provide a first-principles analysis of the Expectation of Optimization Bias (EOB), formalizing it information-theoretically as the discrepancy between the true joint distribution and its flawed i.i.d. counterpart. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigm paradox: the more deterministic and structured the time series, the more severe the bias by point-wise loss function. We derive the first closed-form quantification for the non-deterministic EOB across linear and non-linear systems, and prove EOB is an intrinsic data property, governed exclusively by sequence length and our proposed Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR). This theoretical diagnosis motivates our principled debiasing program that eliminates the bias through sequence length reduction and structural orthogonalization.

As a running example, we focus on Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), which, despite its apparent simplicity, requires sequential reasoning, adaptation, and strategy recognition. Our system positions the LLM as an Observer whose task is to identify which strategies are being played and to articulate the reasoning behind this judgment. The purpose is not to test knowledge of Rock-Paper-Scissors itself, but to probe whether the model can exhibit mind-like reasoning about sequential behavior. To support systematic evaluation, we provide a benchmark consisting of both static strategies and lightweight dynamic strategies specified by well-prompted rules. We quantify alignment between the Observer's predictions and the ground-truth distributions induced by actual strategy pairs using three complementary signals: Cross-Entropy, Brier score, and Expected Value (EV) discrepancy. These metrics are further integrated into a unified score, the Union Loss, which balances calibration, sensitivity, and payoff alignment. Together with a Strategy Identification Rate (SIR) metric, our framework captures not only predictive accuracy but also whether the model can stably identify the latent strategies in play. The demo emphasizes interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. Users can adjust LLM distributions in real time, visualize losses as they evolve, and directly inspect reasoning snippets to identify where and why failures occur. In doing so, our system provides a practical and interpretable proxy for mind-like inference in sequential games, offering insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u77f3\u5934\u526a\u5200\u5e03\uff08RPS\uff09\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u5fc3\u667a\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Union Loss\u548cSIR\uff09\u53ca\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u2018\u7406\u89e3\u2019\u6d4b\u8bc4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u5fc3\u667a\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\uff1bRPS\u867d\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u8bbe\u4e3aObserver\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Cross-Entropy\u3001Brier Score\u548cEV discrepancy\u4e09\u91cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u4e3aUnion Loss\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Strategy Identification Rate\uff08SIR\uff09\u8861\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u8bc6\u522b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7247\u6bb5\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6f14\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9LLM\u7b56\u7565\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1bUnion Loss\u7edf\u4e00\u8861\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u3001\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u76ca\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff1bSIR\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fdemo\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u2018\u7406\u89e3\u2019\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Furthermore, natively combining reasoning and outcome rewards may yield suboptimal performance or conflict with the primary optimization objective. To address this, we propose advantage-weighted policy optimization (AWPO) -- a principled RL framework that effectively integrates explicit reasoning rewards to enhance tool-use capability. AWPO incorporates variance-aware gating and difficulty-aware weighting to adaptively modulate advantages from reasoning signals based on group-relative statistics, alongside a tailored clipping mechanism for stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AWPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard tool-use benchmarks, significantly outperforming strong baselines and leading closed-source models in challenging multi-turn scenarios.

Existing image-to-image translation methods primarily aim to learn mappings between domains, often generating diverse synthetic data with variations in anatomical scale and shape, but they usually overlook spatial correspondence during the translation process. For clinical applications, traceability, defined as the ability to provide pixel-level correspondences between original and translated images, is equally important. This property enhances clinical interpretability but has been largely overlooked in previous approaches. To address this gap, we propose Plasticine, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end image-to-image translation framework explicitly designed with traceability as a core objective.

One approach involves the use of plausibility checks, rule-based procedures that assess the correctness and internal consistency of data, to detect anomalies or signs of manipulation. Although these verification procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity, existing plausibility checks are manually implemented by software engineers, which is time-consuming. Recent advances in code generation with large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating and scaling the generation of these checks. However, adapting LLMs to the specific requirements of an unknown domain remains a significant challenge. This work investigates the extent to which LLMs, adapted on domain-specific code and data through different fine-tuning strategies, can generate rule-based plausibility checks for forgery detection on constrained hardware resources.

However, handling high-dimensional visual features often incurs substantial computational and memory costs. VoCo-LLaMA alleviates this issue by compressing visual patch tokens into a few VoCo tokens, reducing computational overhead while preserving strong cross-modal alignment. Nevertheless, such approaches typically adopt a fixed compression rate, limiting their ability to adapt to varying levels of visual complexity. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive-VoCo, a framework that augments VoCo-LLaMA with a lightweight predictor for adaptive compression. This predictor dynamically selects an optimal compression rate by quantifying an image's visual complexity using statistical cues from the vision encoder, such as patch token entropy and attention map variance. Furthermore, we introduce a joint loss function that integrates rate regularization with complexity alignment. This enables the model to balance inference efficiency with representational capacity, particularly in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms fixed-rate baselines across multiple multimodal tasks, highlighting the potential of adaptive visual compression for creating more efficient and robust VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAdaptive-VoCo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u89c9\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u5347VoCo-LLaMA\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptive-VoCo\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982patch token\u71b5\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u8054\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7801\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u89c9\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u89c9\u538b\u7f29\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548VLM\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we study how the choice of pretraining data distribution steers a shallow transformer toward one behavior or the other. Focusing on a minimal trigger-output prediction task -- copying the token immediately following a special trigger upon its second occurrence -- we present a rigorous analysis of gradient-based training of a single-layer transformer. In both the infinite and finite sample regimes, we prove a transition in the learned mechanism: if input sequences exhibit sufficient diversity, measured by a low ``max-sum'' ratio of trigger-to-trigger distances, the trained model implements an induction head and generalizes to unseen contexts; by contrast, when this ratio is large, the model resorts to a positional shortcut and fails to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD). We also reveal a trade-off between the pretraining context length and OOD generalization, and derive the optimal pretraining distribution that minimizes computational cost per sample. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions with controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating that broadening context distributions robustly induces induction heads and enables OOD generalization.

To close this gap, we propose DeliveryBench, a city-scale embodied benchmark grounded in the real-world profession of food delivery. Food couriers naturally operate under long-horizon objectives (maximizing net profit over hours) while managing diverse constraints, e.g., delivery deadline, transportation expense, vehicle battery, and necessary interactions with other couriers and customers. DeliveryBench instantiates this setting in procedurally generated 3D cities with diverse road networks, buildings, functional locations, transportation modes, and realistic resource dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of constraint-aware, long-horizon planning. We benchmark a range of VLM-based agents across nine cities and compare them with human players. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap to humans, and find that these agents are short-sighted and frequently break basic commonsense constraints. Additionally, we observe distinct personalities across models (e.g., adventurous GPT-5 vs. conservative Claude), highlighting both the brittleness and the diversity of current VLM-based embodied agents in realistic, constraint-dense environments.

Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, built upon Encoder-Decoder neural network architectures and trained on massive amounts of data, have progressively reduced transcription errors on standard benchmark datasets. However, their performance in real-world production environments, particularly for non-English content like long-form Italian videos, remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a case study on developing a professional subtitling system for an Italian media company. To inform our system design, we evaluated four state-of-the-art ASR models (Whisper Large v2, AssemblyAI Universal, Parakeet TDT v3 0.6b, and WhisperX) on a 50-hour dataset of Italian television programs. The study highlights their strengths and limitations, benchmarking their performance against the work of professional human subtitlers. The findings indicate that, while current models cannot meet the media industry's accuracy needs for full autonomy, they can serve as highly effective tools for enhancing human productivity. We conclude that a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach is crucial and present the production-grade, cloud-based infrastructure we designed to support this workflow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684ASR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u5b57\u5e55\u5458\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u5de5\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\uff08HITL\uff09\u7684\u4e91\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3ASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Whisper Large v2\u3001AssemblyAI Universal\u3001Parakeet TDT v3 0.6b\u548cWhisperX\u56db\u4e2aASR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u572850\u5c0f\u65f6\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u7535\u89c6\u8282\u76ee\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5de5\u5b57\u5e55\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u90e8\u7f72\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7684\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u4ea7\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5a92\u4f53\u884c\u4e1a\u5bf9\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5b57\u5e55\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u4f46\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6821\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b57\u5e55\u5236\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dASR\u6280\u672f\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u878d\u5165\u4e13\u4e1a\u5b57\u5e55\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\uff1b\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\uff08HITL\uff09\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Traditional modular pipelines suffer from latency and cascading errors across perception, localization, mapping, and planning modules. Recent end-to-end learning methods map raw visual observations directly to control signals or trajectories, promising greater performance and efficiency in open-world settings. However, most prior end-to-end approaches still rely on separate localization modules that depend on accurate sensor extrinsic calibration for self-state estimation, thereby limiting generalization across embodiments and environments. We introduce LoGoPlanner, a localization-grounded, end-to-end navigation framework that addresses these limitations by: (1) finetuning a long-horizon visual-geometry backbone to ground predictions with absolute metric scale, thereby providing implicit state estimation for accurate localization; (2) reconstructing surrounding scene geometry from historical observations to supply dense, fine-grained environmental awareness for reliable obstacle avoidance; and (3) conditioning the policy on implicit geometry bootstrapped by the aforementioned auxiliary tasks, thereby reducing error propagation.We evaluate LoGoPlanner in both simulation and real-world settings, where its fully end-to-end design reduces cumulative error while metric-aware geometry memory enhances planning consistency and obstacle avoidance, leading to more than a 27.3\\% improvement over oracle-localization baselines and strong generalization across embodiments and environments.

Traditional detection methods rely heavily on expert visual inspection, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often impractical for large-scale farming operations. In this paper, we present PlantDiseaseNet-RT50, a novel fine-tuned deep learning architecture based on ResNet50 for automated plant disease detection. Our model features strategically unfrozen layers, a custom classification head with regularization mechanisms, and dynamic learning rate scheduling through cosine decay. Using a comprehensive dataset of distinct plant disease categories across multiple crop species, PlantDiseaseNet-RT50 achieves exceptional performance with approximately 98% accuracy, precision, and recall.

Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) enables RL agents to continually learn and adapt to new tasks, but balancing stability (preserving prior knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge) remains challenging. Existing methods primarily address the stability-plasticity dilemma through mechanisms where past knowledge influences optimization but rarely affects the agent's behavior directly, which may hinder effective knowledge reuse and efficient learning. In contrast, we propose demonstration-guided continual reinforcement learning (DGCRL), which stores prior knowledge in an external, self-evolving demonstration repository that directly guides RL exploration and adaptation. For each task, the agent dynamically selects the most relevant demonstration and follows a curriculum-based strategy to accelerate learning, gradually shifting from demonstration-guided exploration to fully self-exploration. Extensive experiments on 2D navigation and MuJoCo locomotion tasks demonstrate its superior average performance, enhanced knowledge transfer, mitigation of forgetting, and training efficiency.

Our key insight is that frontier AI models already possess the knowledge required to solve challenging problems -- they simply do not know how, what, or when to apply it. Vibe Reasoning transforms AI's latent potential into manifested capability through generic meta-prompts, agentic grounding, and model orchestration. We demonstrate this paradigm through IMO 2025 Problem 6, a combinatorial optimization problem where autonomous AI systems publicly reported failures. Our solution combined GPT-5's exploratory capabilities with Gemini 3 Pro's proof strengths, leveraging agentic workflows with Python code execution and file-based memory, to derive both the correct answer (2112) and a rigorous mathematical proof. Through iterative refinement across multiple attempts, we discovered the necessity of agentic grounding and model orchestration, while human prompts evolved from problem-specific hints to generic, transferable meta-prompts. We analyze why capable AI fails autonomously, how each component addresses specific failure modes, and extract principles for effective vibe reasoning.

A well-defined challenge in this domain is ship type classification. Due to the high diversity and complexity of ship types, accurate recognition is difficult and typically requires specialized deep learning models. These models, however, depend on large, high-quality ground-truth datasets to achieve robust performance and generalization. Furthermore, the growing variety of SAR satellites operating at different frequencies and spatial resolutions has amplified the need for more annotated datasets to enhance model accuracy. To address this, we present the NovaSAR Automated Ship Target Recognition (NASTaR) dataset. This dataset comprises of 3415 ship patches extracted from NovaSAR S-band imagery, with labels matched to AIS data. It includes distinctive features such as 23 unique classes, inshore/offshore separation, and an auxiliary wake dataset for patches where ship wakes are visible. We validated the dataset applicability across prominent ship-type classification scenarios using benchmark deep learning models. Results demonstrate over 60% accuracy for classifying four major ship types, over 70% for a three-class scenario, more than 75% for distinguishing cargo from tanker ships, and over 87% for identifying fishing vessels.

The method first designs a structure-guided scheduling graph construction mechanism that integrates task execution stages, resource node states, and scheduling path information to build dynamically evolving scheduling behavior graphs, enhancing the model's ability to capture global scheduling relationships. On this basis, a multi-scale graph semantic aggregation module is introduced to achieve semantic consistency modeling of scheduling features through local adjacency semantic integration and global topology alignment, thereby strengthening the model's capability to capture abnormal features in complex scenarios such as multi-task concurrency, resource competition, and stage transitions. Experiments are conducted on a real scheduling dataset with multiple scheduling disturbance paths set to simulate different types of anomalies, including structural shifts, resource changes, and task delays. The proposed model demonstrates significant performance advantages across multiple metrics, showing a sensitive response to structural disturbances and semantic shifts. Further visualization analysis reveals that, under the combined effect of structure guidance and semantic aggregation, the scheduling behavior graph exhibits stronger anomaly separability and pattern representation, validating the effectiveness and adaptability of the method in scheduling anomaly detection tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u56fe\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8c03\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8c03\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u53d1\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u548c\u9636\u6bb5\u5207\u6362\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u8282\u70b9\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u8def\u5f84\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u63a5\u8bed\u4e49\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8c03\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79fb\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Leveraging these resources, Helios undergoes large-scale pretraining, SFT, and RLHF.

We introduce CycleChart, a consistency-based learning framework for bidirectional chart understanding and generation.

We construct a consistent multi-task dataset, where each chart sample includes aligned annotations for schema prediction, data parsing, and question answering. To learn cross-directional chart semantics, CycleChart introduces a generate-parse consistency objective: the model generates a chart schema from a table and a textual query, then learns to recover the schema and data from the generated chart, enforcing semantic alignment across directions. CycleChart achieves strong results on chart generation, chart parsing, and chart question answering, demonstrating improved cross-task generalization and marking a step toward more general chart understanding models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CycleChart \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 schema-centric \u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u63a5\u53e3\u548c generate-parse \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u8868\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u8868\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u8868\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u751f\u6210\uff09\u88ab\u5b64\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5171\u4eab\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CycleChart \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5 schema \u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u6ce8\uff08schema \u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165 generate-parse \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5373\u4ece\u8868\u683c\u548c\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u8868 schema \u540e\uff0c\u518d\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u8868\u4e2d\u6062\u590d schema \u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u53cc\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u751f\u6210\u3001\u56fe\u8868\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CycleChart \u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u6253\u901a\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We identify the root cause as modal asymmetry: while the visual encoder can extract discriminative features from unseen images, the text encoder is constrained by a fixed discrete vocabulary and cannot synthesize new semantic anchors. Existing approaches such as CoOp or LoRA provide only partial remedies, as they remain confined to the pre-trained semantic space.\n  To overcome this bottleneck, we propose dynamic representation optimization, realized through the Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA) framework. At inference time, GTMA constructs a continuous pseudo-word embedding that best aligns with an OOD image's visual anchor, effectively bypassing vocabulary limitations. The optimization is driven by an adaptive gradient-based representation policy optimization algorithm, which incorporates semantic regularization to preserve plausibility and compatibility with the model's prior knowledge.\n  Experiments on ImageNet-R and the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that GTMA improves zero-shot and few-shot OOD accuracy by up to 15-20 percent over the base VLM while maintaining performance on in-distribution concepts.

To address the inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity of EEG signals, this paper proposes a multi-branch parallel architecture, where each temporal scale is equipped with an independent spatial feature extraction module. To further enhance multi-branch feature fusion, we propose a Fusion of Multiscale Features via Centralized Sparse-attention Network (EEG-CSANet), a centralized sparse-attention network. It employs a main-auxiliary branch architecture, where the main branch models core spatiotemporal patterns via multiscale self-attention, and the auxiliary branch facilitates efficient local interactions through sparse cross-attention. Experimental results show that EEG-CSANet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across five public datasets (BCIC-IV-2A, BCIC-IV-2B, HGD, SEED, and SEED-VIG), with accuracies of 88.54%, 91.09%, 99.43%, 96.03%, and 90.56%, respectively. Such performance demonstrates its strong adaptability and robustness across various EEG decoding tasks. Moreover, extensive ablation studies are conducted to enhance the interpretability of EEG-CSANet. In the future, we hope that EEG-CSANet could serve as a promising baseline model in the field of EEG signal decoding.

Standard adversarial training, while effective for simpler tasks, often degrades both generalization performance and the quality of generated clinical reasoning. We introduce SafeMed-R1, a hybrid defense framework that ensures robust performance while preserving high-quality, interpretable medical reasoning. SafeMed-R1 employs a two-stage approach: at training time, we integrate Adversarial Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO) to explicitly robustify the reasoning process against worst-case perturbations; at inference time, we augment the model with Randomized Smoothing to provide certified $L_2$-norm robustness guarantees. We evaluate SafeMed-R1 on the OmniMedVQA benchmark across eight medical imaging modalities comprising over 88,000 samples. Our experiments reveal that standard fine-tuned VLMs, despite achieving 95\\% accuracy on clean inputs, collapse to approximately 25\\% under PGD attacks. In contrast, SafeMed-R1 maintains 84.45\\% accuracy under the same adversarial conditions, representing a 59 percentage point improvement in robustness.

Furthermore, what social features of stigmas are associated with bias in LLM outputs is unknown. From psychology literature, it has been shown that stigmas contain six shared social features: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, and peril. In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship. We find that stigmas rated by humans to be highly perilous (e.g., being a gang member or having HIV) have the most biased outputs from SocialStigmaQA prompts (60% of outputs from all models) while sociodemographic stigmas (e.g. Asian-American or old age) have the least amount of biased outputs (11%). We test if the amount of biased outputs could be decreased by using guardrail models, models meant to identify harmful input, using each LLM's respective guardrail model (Granite Guardian 3.0, Llama Guard 3.0, Mistral Moderation API). We find that bias decreases significantly by 10.4%, 1.4%, and 7.8%, respectively. However, we show that features with significant effect on bias remain unchanged post-mitigation and that guardrail models often fail to recognize the intent of bias in prompts. This work has implications for using LLMs in scenarios involving stigmatized groups and we suggest future work towards improving guardrail models for bias mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u975e\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u8eab\u4efd\uff08\u5982HIV\u611f\u67d3\u8005\u3001\u5e2e\u6d3e\u6210\u5458\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6c61\u540d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u2018\u5371\u9669\u6027\u2019peril\uff09\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u504f\u89c1\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u9ad8\u5371\u9669\u6027\u6c61\u540d\u5bfc\u81f460%\u8f93\u51fa\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u800c\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u7c7b\u6c61\u540d\u4ec511%\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b88\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u90e8\u5206\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u964d10.4%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u504f\u89c1\u9a71\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8LLM\u5bf9\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u6027\u522b\uff09\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u975e\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u8eab\u4efd\uff08\u5982\u7cbe\u795e\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u72af\u7f6a\u5173\u8054\u8eab\u4efd\uff09\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8003\u5bdf\uff1b\u4e14\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6c61\u540d\u516d\u5927\u793e\u4f1a\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u7f8e\u5b66\u3001\u53ef\u9690\u85cf\u6027\u3001\u75c5\u7a0b\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u6027\u3001\u8d77\u6e90\u3001\u5371\u9669\u6027\uff09\u4e2d\u54ea\u4e9b\u771f\u6b63\u9a71\u52a8LLM\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6c61\u540d\u516d\u7ef4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u5bf993\u4e2a\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SocialStigmaQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u542b37\u4e2a\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u5883\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u662f\u5426\u63a8\u8350\u5b9e\u4e60\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30Granite 3.0-8B\u3001Llama-3.1-8B\u3001Mistral-7B\u4e09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u5957\u5b88\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\uff08Granite Guardian\u3001Llama Guard\u3001Mistral Moderation API\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u5b88\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u6c61\u540d\u7684\u2018\u5371\u9669\u6027\u2019\uff08peril\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u4e0eLLM\u504f\u89c1\u6700\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1a\u9ad8\u5371\u9669\u6027\u6c61\u540d\uff08\u5982\u5e2e\u6d3e\u6210\u5458\u3001HIV\u611f\u67d3\u8005\uff09\u5f15\u53d160%\u504f\u89c1\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u6c61\u540d\uff08\u5982\u4e9a\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u3001\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\uff09\u4ec511%\uff1b2\uff09\u5b88\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u89c1\u7387\uff08\u5206\u522b\u964d10.4%\u30011.4%\u30017.8%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6539\u53d8\u2018\u5371\u9669\u6027\u2019\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3\uff09\u5b88\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5bf9\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6c61\u540d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u2018\u5371\u9669\u6027\u2019\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u5b88\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0a\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u504f\u89c1\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u54cd\u5e94\u6c61\u540d\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u504f\u89c1\u5b88\u95e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u654f\u611f\u793e\u4f1a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

This paper presents a robust detection framework that leverages multiple uncertainty measures to decide whether to trust or reject a model's predictions. We focus on three complementary techniques: Fisher Information, which captures the sensitivity of model parameters to input variations; entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout, which reflects predictive variability; and predictive variance from a Deep Kernel Learning framework using a Gaussian Process classifier. To integrate these diverse uncertainty signals, Particle Swarm Optimisation is used to learn optimal weightings and determine an adaptive rejection threshold. The model is trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images and evaluated on GLIDE, VQDM, Midjourney, BigGAN, and StyleGAN3, each introducing significant distribution shifts. While standard metrics such as prediction probability and Fisher-based measures perform well in distribution, their effectiveness degrades under shift. In contrast, the Combined Uncertainty measure consistently achieves an incorrect rejection rate of approximately 70 percent on unseen generators, successfully filtering most misclassified AI samples. Although the system occasionally rejects correct predictions from newer generators, this conservative behaviour is acceptable, as rejected samples can support retraining. The framework maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data. Under adversarial attacks using FGSM and PGD, the Combined Uncertainty method rejects around 61 percent of successful attacks, while GP-based uncertainty alone achieves up to 80 percent.

To discover risky samples, previous literature attempts to search for patterns of risky samples within existing datasets or inject perturbation into them. Yet in this way the diversity of risky samples is limited by the coverage of existing datasets. To overcome this limitation, recent works adopt diffusion models to produce new risky samples beyond the coverage of existing datasets. However, these methods struggle in the conformity between generated samples and expected categories, which could introduce label noise and severely limit their effectiveness in applications. To address this issue, we propose RiskyDiff that incorporates the embeddings of both texts and images as implicit constraints of category conformity. We also design a conformity score to further explicitly strengthen the category conformity, as well as introduce the mechanisms of embedding screening and risky gradient guidance to boost the risk of generated samples. Extensive experiments reveal that RiskyDiff greatly outperforms existing methods in terms of the degree of risk, generation quality, and conformity with conditioned categories. We also empirically show the generalization ability of the models can be enhanced by augmenting training data with generated samples of high conformity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRiskyDiff\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6027\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u9762\u4e34\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRiskyDiff\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9690\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\u663e\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u98ce\u9669\u6027\u3002", "result": "RiskyDiff\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u7c7b\u522b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7528\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RiskyDiff\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u98ce\u9669\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate plausible hidden confounders based on domain knowledge, yet a critical gap exists: LLM-generated confounders often exhibit semantic plausibility without statistical utility.

Unlike prior approaches that treat generation and validation as separate stages, VIGOR+ establishes an iterative feedback mechanism: validation signals from CEVAE (including information gain, latent consistency metrics, and diagnostic messages) are transformed into natural language feedback that guides subsequent LLM generation rounds.

Training-based methods inject priors into parameters, but this static coupling hinders rapid knowledge updates and often compromises the model's general reasoning capabilities. Conversely, existing training-free methods avoid these issues but rely on surface-level prompting, failing to provide the fine-grained atom-level priors essential for precise chemical reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce ChemATP, a framework that decouples chemical knowledge from the reasoning engine. By constructing the first atom-level textual knowledge base, ChemATP enables frozen LLMs to explicitly retrieve and reason over this information dynamically.

However, it has been unclear how event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) approaches could leverage fine-grained temporal information of sparse events. This work proposes a framework to address the trade-off between accuracy and temporal resolution in event-based 3DGS. Our key idea is to decouple the rendering into two branches: event-by-event geometry (depth) rendering and snapshot-based radiance (intensity) rendering, by using ray-tracing and the image of warped events. The extensive evaluation shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world datasets and competitive performance on the synthetic dataset. Also, the proposed method works without prior information (e.g., pretrained image reconstruction models) or COLMAP-based initialization, is more flexible in the event selection number, and achieves sharp reconstruction on scene edges with fast training time. We hope that this work deepens our understanding of the sparse nature of events for 3D reconstruction.

We present WoundNet-Ensemble, an Internet of Medical Things system leveraging a novel ensemble of three complementary deep learning architectures: ResNet-50, the self-supervised Vision Transformer DINOv2, and Swin Transformer, for automated classification of six clinically distinct wound types. Our system achieves 99.90 percent ensemble accuracy on a comprehensive dataset of 5,175 wound images spanning diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, thermal burns, pilonidal sinus wounds, and fungating malignant tumors. The weighted fusion strategy demonstrates a 3.7 percent improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we implement a longitudinal wound healing tracker that computes healing rates, severity scores, and generates clinical alerts.

However, improving GPU utilization may compromise latency-sensitive scheduling, as concurrent tasks contend for GPU resources and thereby introduce interference. Given that interference effects introduce unpredictability in scheduling, neglecting them may compromise SLO or deadline satisfaction. Nevertheless, existing interference prediction approaches remain limited in several respects, which may restrict their usefulness for scheduling. First, they are often coarse-grained, which ignores runtime co-location dynamics and thus restricts their accuracy in interference prediction. Second, they tend to use a static prediction model, which may not effectively cope with different workload characteristics.

While prior studies have examined this behavior in text-only settings of large language models, existing research on visual or multimodal counterparts remains limited in scope and depth of analysis. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, \\textit{PENDULUM}, comprising approximately 2,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering pairs specifically designed to elicit sycophantic responses. The benchmark spans six distinct image domains of varying complexity, enabling a systematic investigation of how image type and inherent challenges influence sycophantic tendencies. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs. we observe substantial variability in model robustness and a pronounced susceptibility to sycophantic and hallucinatory behavior. Furthermore, we propose novel metrics to quantify sycophancy in visual reasoning, offering deeper insights into its manifestations across different multimodal contexts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing sycophancy-resilient architectures and training strategies to enhance factual consistency and reliability in future MLLMs. Our proposed dataset with MLLMs response are available at https://github.com/ashikiut/pendulum/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPENDULUM\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\uff08sycophancy\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u5df2\u6709\u63a2\u8ba8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u7ea62000\u7ec4\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8VQA\u6837\u672c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6PENDULUM\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u516d\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5404\u5f02\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u5bf9\u524d\u6cbfMLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540cMLLMs\u5728\u8c04\u5a9a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8c04\u5a9a\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u523b\u753b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u8c04\u5a9a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c04\u5a9a\u662f\u5236\u7ea6MLLMs\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u6297\u8c04\u5a9a\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1bPENDULUM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel prompt optimization pipeline for frame detection in logistics texts, combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and automatic CoT synthesis (Auto-CoT) to generate highly effective task-specific prompts. Central to our approach is an LLM-based prompt optimizer agent that iteratively refines the prompts using retrieved examples, performance feedback, and internal self-evaluation. Our framework is evaluated on a real-world logistics text annotation task, where reasoning accuracy and labeling efficiency are critical. Experimental results show that the optimized prompts - particularly those enhanced via Auto-CoT and RAG - improve real-world inference accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline zero-shot or static prompts. The system demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple LLMs, including GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5 (72B), and LLaMA 3.1 (70B), validating its generalizability and practical value.

This work proposes a Bayesian framework for pretraining in MDA by considering that the distributions of different source domains are typically similar. The Hierarchical Bayesian Framework uses similarity between the different source data distributions to optimize the pretraining for MDA. Experiments using the proposed Bayesian framework for MDA show that our framework improves accuracy on recognition tasks for a large benchmark dataset.

Yet their theoretical underpinnings remain limited. We exploit the closed-form energy-based model (EBM) structure of the optimal KL-regularized policy to provide a unified variational analysis of LLMs.\n  For instruction-tuned models, under natural assumptions on reward potentials and pretraining symmetry, we prove that the transition kernel satisfies detailed balance with respect to a scalar potential encoding response quality. This yields monotonic KL convergence to a high-quality stationary distribution, bounded hitting times to superior states, and exponential mixing governed by the spectral gap.\n  For reasoning models trained with verifiable rewards (RLVR), we show the objective is equivalent to expected KL minimization toward an optimal reasoning distribution, with the suboptimality gap reducing to the Bernoulli KL between target and current accuracies along the natural gradient flow.

In this work, we instead consider the use of first-order languages in goal-conditioned RL and generalized planning. The question is how to learn goal-conditioned and general policies when the training instances are large and the goal cannot be reached by random exploration alone. The technique of Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) provides an answer to this question: it relabels unsuccessful trajectories as successful ones by replacing the original goal with one that was actually achieved. If the target policy must generalize across states and goals, trajectories that do not reach the original goal states can enable more data- and time-efficient learning. In this work, we show that further performance gains can be achieved when states and goals are represented by sets of atoms. We consider three versions: goals as full states, goals as subsets of the original goals, and goals as lifted versions of these subgoals.

To that end, we have developed CienaLLM, a modular framework based on schema-guided Generative Information Extraction. CienaLLM uses open-weight Large Language Models for zero-shot information extraction from news articles, and supports configurable prompts and output schemas, multi-step pipelines, and cloud or on-premise inference. To systematically assess how the choice of LLM family, size, precision regime, and prompting strategy affect performance, we run a large factorial study in models, precisions, and prompt engineering techniques. An additional response parsing step nearly eliminates format errors while preserving accuracy; larger models deliver the strongest and most stable performance, while quantization offers substantial efficiency gains with modest accuracy trade-offs; and prompt strategies show heterogeneous, model-specific effects. CienaLLM matches or outperforms the supervised baseline in accuracy for extracting drought impacts from Spanish news, although at a higher inference cost. While evaluated in droughts, the schema-driven and model-agnostic design is suitable for adapting to related information extraction tasks (e.g., other hazards, sectors, or languages) by editing prompts and schemas rather than retraining.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce VLNVerse: a new large-scale, extensible benchmark designed for Versatile, Embodied, Realistic Simulation, and Evaluation. VLNVerse redefines VLN as a scalable, full-stack embodied AI problem. Its Versatile nature unifies previously fragmented tasks into a single framework and provides an extensible toolkit for researchers. Its Embodied design moves beyond intangible and teleporting \"ghost\" agents that support full-kinematics in a Realistic Simulation powered by a robust physics engine. We leverage the scale and diversity of VLNVerse to conduct a comprehensive Evaluation of existing methods, from classic models to MLLM-based agents. We also propose a novel unified multi-task model capable of addressing all tasks within the benchmark.

In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations contributing to this issue: insufficient visual representation learning and poor visual attention alignment. To address these problems, we propose MEDALIGN, a simple, lightweight alignment distillation framework that transfers visual alignment knowledge from a domain-specific Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to Med-LVLMs. MEDALIGN introduces two distillation losses: a spatial-aware visual alignment loss based on visual token-level similarity structures, and an attention-aware distillation loss that guides attention toward diagnostically relevant regions. Extensive experiments on medical report generation and medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks show that MEDALIGN consistently improves both performance and interpretability, yielding more visually grounded outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMEDALIGN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9aCLIP\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Med-LVLMs\uff09\u56e0\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u9519\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Med-LVLMs\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u9519\u4f4d\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6MEDALIGN\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9token\u7ea7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u805a\u7126\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMEDALIGN\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u89c6\u89c9 grounded \u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "MEDALIGN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3Med-LVLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We observe that when these models are queried conditionally, their generations consistently deviate from the idealized \"denoising\" process upon which diffusion models are formulated, inducing disagreement between popular sampling algorithms (e.g. DDPM, DDIM). We introduce Schedule Deviation, a rigorous measure which captures the rate of deviation from a standard denoising process, and provide a methodology to compute it. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deviation from an idealized denoising process occurs irrespective of the model capacity or amount of training data. We posit that this phenomenon occurs due to the difficulty of bridging distinct denoising flows across different parts of the conditioning space and show theoretically how such a phenomenon can arise through an inductive bias towards smoothness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u4f1a\u504f\u79bb\u7406\u60f3\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u2018Schedule Deviation\u2019\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u53bb\u566a\u6d41\u96be\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5e26\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6761\u4ef6\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4f55\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u5185\u5728\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSchedule Deviation\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u79bb\u6807\u51c6\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6761\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6d41\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53bb\u566a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u4e0d\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6d88\u5931\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u7531\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u81ea\u7136\u5bfc\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u2014\u2014\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6761\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u8def\u5f84\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fDDPM\u3001DDIM\u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002"}}

The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u8868\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbGNN\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f7fActor-Critic\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u51fa\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u6210\u529f\u4f46\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u80fd\u5426\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u914d\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u8868\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408Actor-Critic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6d3e\u751f\u8c13\u8bcd\u548c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4ee3\u4ef7\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aGNN\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "Actor-Critic\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u51fa\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e14\u89c4\u907f\u4e86\u540e\u8005\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u6c60\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDRL\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8eGNN\u56fa\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u9650\u5236\u53ca\u6700\u4f18\u6027-\u6cdb\u5316\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u800c\u975eRL\u6216DL\u7b97\u6cd5\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5206\u7c7b+GNN\uff09\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u6d3e\u751f\u8c13\u8bcd\u3001\u65b0\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff09\uff0c\u6807\u51c6DRL\u6846\u67b6\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u66f4\u6362\u6838\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

A fundamental challenge in observational data is that while we need to infer outcome differences under alternative treatments, we can only observe each individual's outcome under a single treatment. Existing approaches address this limitation either by training with inferred pseudo-outcomes or by creating matched instance pairs. However, recent work has largely overlooked the potential impact of post-treatment variables on the outcome. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. This paper introduces Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Counterfactual Regression (PIPCFR), a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that ignore these variables or impose restrictive assumptions, PIPCFR learns effective representations that preserve informative components while mitigating bias. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPIPCFR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u53d8\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u4f2a\u7ed3\u679c\u63d2\u8865\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u4f53\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\uff08ITE\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u679c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPIPCFR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u53d8\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u4f2a\u7ed3\u679c\u63d2\u8865\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684ITE\u98ce\u9669\u7406\u8bba\u754c\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u4fe1\u606f\u53c8\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPIPCFR\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86ITE\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u6cbb\u7597\u540e\u53d8\u91cf\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347ITE\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0cPIPCFR\u4e3a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5f52\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This digital ''amnesia'' results in sub-optimal performance, repeated errors, and poor generalization to novel challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoTrail-GUI, a novel framework designed to mimic human-like experiential learning by equipping agents with a dynamic, accessible memory. Our framework operates in three distinct stages. First, during Experience Exploration, an agent autonomously interacts with GUI environments to build a curated database of successful task trajectories, validated by a reward model. Crucially, the entire knowledge base construction is thus fully automated, requiring no human supervision. Second, in the Memory Injection stage, upon receiving a new task, our system efficiently retrieves the most relevant past trajectories to serve as actionable ''memories''.

These parametric models, termed GMM-QFs, possess substantial representational capacity, as they are shown to be universal approximators over a broad class of functions. They are further embedded within Bellman residuals, where their learnable parameters -- a fixed number of mixing weights, together with Gaussian mean vectors and covariance matrices -- are inferred from data via optimization on a Riemannian manifold. This geometric perspective on the parameter space naturally incorporates Riemannian optimization into the policy-evaluation step of standard policy-iteration frameworks. Rigorous theoretical results are established, and supporting numerical tests show that, even without access to experience data, GMM-QFs deliver competitive performance and, in some cases, outperform state-of-the-art approaches across a range of benchmark RL tasks, all while maintaining a significantly smaller computational footprint than deep-learning methods that rely on experience data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08GMM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3aQ\u51fd\u6570\u635f\u5931\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4ee3\u7406\uff08GMM-QFs\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7528\u9014\uff1b\u5176\u5728\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRL\u4e2dGMM\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u62d3\u5c55\u5176\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3aQ\u51fd\u6570\u635f\u5931\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u3001\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGMM-QF\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06GMM\u4f5c\u4e3aQ\u51fd\u6570\u635f\u5931\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\uff1b\u5728\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\uff08\u7531GMM\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884cRiemannian\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5d4c\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGMM-QFs\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff08experience data\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6RL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "GMM-QFs\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86GMM\u5728RL\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing semi-supervised methods typically treat data as purely numerical and} in a deterministic manner, thereby neglecting the heterogeneity and uncertainty inherent in complex, real-world datasets. This paper introduces a label-informed outlier detection method for heterogeneous data based on Granular Computing and Fuzzy Sets, namely Granule Density-based Outlier Factor (GDOF). Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers. The integration of Fuzzy Sets and Granular Computing in GDOF offers a practical framework for outlier detection in complex and diverse data types. All relevant datasets and source codes are publicly available for further research. This is the author's accepted manuscript of a paper published in IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems.

However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively.

In addition, its environment lacks key application categories, such as e-commerce and enterprise communication, and does not reflect realistic mobile-use scenarios characterized by vague user instructions and hybrid tool usage. To bridge this gap, we introduce MobileWorld, a substantially more challenging benchmark designed to better reflect real-world mobile usage, comprising 201 tasks across 20 applications, while maintaining the same level of reproducible evaluation as AndroidWorld. The difficulty of MobileWorld is twofold. First, it emphasizes long-horizon tasks with cross-application interactions: MobileWorld requires nearly twice as many task-completion steps on average (27.8 vs. 14.3) and includes far more multi-application tasks (62.2% vs. 9.5%) compared to AndroidWorld. Second, MobileWorld extends beyond standard GUI manipulation by introducing novel task categories, including agent-user interaction and MCP-augmented tasks. To ensure robust evaluation, we provide snapshot-based container environment and precise functional verifications, including backend database inspection and task callback APIs. We further develop a planner-executor agentic framework with extended action spaces to support user interactions and MCP calls. Our results reveal a sharp performance drop compared to AndroidWorld, with the best agentic framework and end-to-end model achieving 51.7% and 20.9% success rates, respectively. Our analysis shows that current models struggle significantly with user interaction and MCP calls, offering a strategic roadmap toward more robust, next-generation mobile intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0MobileWorld\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709AndroidWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002MobileWorld\u5305\u542b201\u4e2a\u8de820\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u957f\u5468\u671f\u3001\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u534f\u540c\u3001\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u53caMCP\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5957\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u66b4\u9732\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "AndroidWorld\u5df2\u8d8b\u9971\u548c\uff08\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d8590%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7535\u5546\u3001\u4f01\u4e1a\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u7cca\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u79fb\u52a8\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaMobileWorld\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u6db5\u76d6201\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u300120\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u957f\u5468\u671f\uff08\u5e73\u574727.8\u6b65\uff09\u3001\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8de8\u5e94\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\uff0862.2%\uff09\uff1b\u65b0\u589e\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0eMCP\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u7167\u5f0f\u5bb9\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u529f\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u56de\u8c03API\uff09\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u548cMCP\u8c03\u7528\u7684planner-executor\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728MobileWorld\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u4f18agentic\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u964d\u81f351.7%\u548c20.9%\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u548cMCP\u8c03\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u8584\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "MobileWorld\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9762\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u79fb\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u6f14\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent restoration agents, powered by vision-language models and large language models, offer promising restoration capabilities but suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks due to reflection, rollback, and iterative tool searching. Moreover, their performance heavily depends on degradation recognition models that require extensive annotations for training, limiting their applicability in label-free environments. To address these limitations, we propose a policy optimization-based restoration framework that learns an lightweight agent to determine tool-calling sequences. The agent operates in a sequential decision process, selecting the most appropriate restoration operation at each step to maximize final image quality. To enable training within label-free environments, we introduce a novel reward mechanism driven by multimodal large language models, which act as human-aligned evaluator and provide perceptual feedback for policy improvement. Once trained, our agent executes a deterministic restoration plans without redundant tool invocations, significantly accelerating inference while maintaining high restoration quality.

However, current CRPS ensemble approaches vary in their training strategies and noise injection mechanisms, with most injecting noise globally throughout the network via conditional normalization. This structure increases training expense and limits the physical interpretability of the stochastic perturbations. We introduce Stochastic Decomposition Layers (SDL) for converting deterministic machine learning weather models into probabilistic ensemble systems. Adapted from StyleGAN's hierarchical noise injection, SDL applies learned perturbations at three decoder scales through latent-driven modulation, per-pixel noise, and channel scaling. When applied to WXFormer via transfer learning, SDL requires less than 2\\% of the computational cost needed to train the baseline model. Each ensemble member is generated from a compact latent tensor (5 MB), enabling perfect reproducibility and post-inference spread adjustment through latent rescaling. Evaluation on 2022 ERA5 reanalysis shows ensembles with spread-skill ratios approaching unity and rank histograms that progressively flatten toward uniformity through medium-range forecasts, achieving calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS.

Inspired by this, this paper proposes a new LLM-Centric Lifelong Empathic Motion Generation (L^2-EMG) task, which aims to equip LLMs with the capability to continually acquire emotional motion generation knowledge across different unseen scenarios, potentially contributing to building a closed-loop and self-evolving embodied agent equipped with both empathy and intelligence. Further, this paper poses two key challenges in the L^2-EMG task, i.e., the emotion decoupling challenge and the scenario adapting challenge. To this end, this paper proposes an Emotion-Transferable and Scenario-Adapted Mixture of Experts (ES-MoE) approach which designs a causal-guided emotion decoupling block and a scenario-adapted expert constructing block to address the two challenges, respectively. Especially, this paper constructs multiple L^2-EMG datasets to validate the effectiveness of the ES-MoE approach.

We present Text2Graph VPR, an explainable semantic localization system that converts image sequences into textual scene descriptions, parses those descriptions into structured scene graphs, and reasons over the resulting graphs to identify places. Scene graphs capture objects, attributes and pairwise relations; we aggregate per-frame graphs into a compact place representation and perform retrieval with a dual-similarity mechanism that fuses learned Graph Attention Network (GAT) embeddings and a Shortest-Path (SP) kernel for structural matching. This hybrid design enables both learned semantic matching and topology-aware comparison, and -- critically -- produces human-readable intermediate representations that support diagnostic analysis and improve transparency in the decision process. We validate the system on Oxford RobotCar and MSLS (Amman/San Francisco) benchmarks and demonstrate robust retrieval under severe appearance shifts, along with zero-shot operation using human textual queries. The results illustrate that semantic, graph-based reasoning is a viable and interpretable alternative for place recognition, particularly suited to safety-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faText2Graph VPR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u518d\u89e3\u6790\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u6838\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u671f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff08VPR\uff09\u9700\u8d85\u8d8a\u50cf\u7d20\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u5bf9\u5149\u7167\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u53d8\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u53ca\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff1b\u805a\u5408\u5355\u5e27\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u5730\u70b9\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GAT\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff08SP\uff09\u6838\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728Oxford RobotCar\u548cMSLS\uff08Amman/San Francisco\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While recent video generation models such as Sora, Kling, and CogVideoX achieve impressive results on natural video synthesis, they exhibit notable limitations when applied to animation generation. Recent efforts, such as AniSora, demonstrate promising performance by fine-tuning image-to-video models for animation styles, yet analogous exploration in the text-to-video setting remains limited.\n  In this work, we present PTTA, a pure text-to-animation framework for high-quality animation creation.

The current standard for evaluating this capability is MedCalc-Bench, a large-scale dataset constructed using LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation. However, treating such model-generated benchmarks as static oracles risks enshrining historical model errors as evaluation gold standards, a problem dangerously amplified when these datasets serve as reward signals for Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose viewing benchmarks for complex tasks such as clinical score computation as ''in-progress living documents'' that should be periodically re-evaluated as the processes for creating them improve. We introduce a systematic, physician-in-the-loop pipeline that leverages advanced agentic verifiers to audit and relabel MedCalc-Bench, utilizing automated triage to reserve scarce clinician attention for the most contentious instances. Our audit reveals that a notable fraction of original labels diverge from medical ground truth due to extraction errors, calculator logic mismatches, and clinical ambiguity. To study whether this label noise meaningfully impacts downstream RL training, we fine-tune a Qwen3-8B model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and demonstrate that training on corrected labels yields an 8.7% absolute improvement in accuracy over the original baseline -- validating that label noise materially affects model evaluation. These findings underscore that in safety-critical domains, rigorous benchmark maintenance is a prerequisite for genuine model alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u89c6\u4e3a\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u2018\u6d3b\u6587\u6863\u2019\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fee\u6b63MedCalc-Bench\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53478.7%\uff09\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u57fa\u51c6\u7ef4\u62a4\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982MedCalc-Bench\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u56fa\u6709\u9519\u8bef\u88ab\u56fa\u5316\u4e3a\u2018\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u2019\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u5176\u7528\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u653e\u5927\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff08agentic verifiers\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u7591\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u8bca\u5c06\u6700\u5bcc\u4e89\u8bae\u6837\u672c\u4ea4\u7531\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u590d\u6838\u4e0e\u91cd\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Group Relative Policy Optimization\uff08GRPO\uff09\u5bf9Qwen3-8B\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53d1\u73b0\u539f\u59cbMedCalc-Bench\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5668\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4fee\u6b63\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u539f\u59cb\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53478.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u771f\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u9700\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u6f14\u8fdb\u7684\u2018\u6d3b\u6587\u6863\u2019\u52a0\u4ee5\u7ef4\u62a4\uff1b\u5ffd\u89c6\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8fd0\u7ef4\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u53ef\u4fe1\u843d\u5730\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u3002"}}

The system integrates semantic text clustering, automatic question generation, retrieval augmented answer extraction with citations, multi-level summarization, and executive summary generation, supported by internal evaluation metrics that emulate expert reasoning. We evaluated the framework across 13 humanitarian events, including natural disasters and conflicts, using more than 1,100 documents from verified sources such as ReliefWeb. The generated questions achieved 84.7 percent relevance, 84.0 percent importance, and 76.4 percent urgency. The extracted answers reached 86.3 percent relevance, with citation precision and recall both exceeding 76 percent. Agreement between human and LLM based evaluations surpassed an F1 score of 0.80. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed framework produces reports that are more structured, interpretable, and actionable than existing baselines.

In this paper, We present Uni-Neur2Img, a unified framework for neural signal-driven image generation and editing. The framework introduces a parameter-efficient LoRA-based neural signal injection module that independently processes each conditioning signal as a pluggable component, facilitating flexible multi-modal conditioning without altering base model parameters. Additionally, we employ a causal attention mechanism accommodate the long-sequence modeling demands of conditional generation tasks. Existing neural-driven generation research predominantly focuses on textual modalities as conditions or intermediate representations, resulting in limited exploration of visual modalities as direct conditioning signals. To bridge this research gap, we introduce the EEG-Style dataset. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across public benchmarks and self-collected neural signal datasets: (1) EEG-driven image generation on the public CVPR40 dataset; (2) neural signal-guided image editing on the public Loongx dataset for semantic-aware local modifications; and (3) EEG-driven style transfer on our self-collected EEG-Style dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in generation fidelity, editing consistency, and style transfer quality while maintaining low computational overhead and strong scalability to additional modalities. Thus, Uni-Neur2Img offers a unified, efficient, and extensible solution for bridging neural signals and visual content generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Uni-Neur2Img\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982EEG\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6EEG-Style\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u76f4\u63a5\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982EEG\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765 bridging \u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2aEEG\u9a71\u52a8\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6EEG-Style\u3002", "result": "\u5728CVPR40\uff08EEG\u751f\u6210\uff09\u3001Loongx\uff08\u795e\u7ecf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u5efaEEG-Style\uff08EEG\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5f3a\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Uni-Neur2Img\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8111\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}

It has already been established that Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are particularly well suited for federated learning and can be merged through simple parameter averaging.

To the best knowledge of the authors, the fastest currently-available combination is the Newton-Kaczmarz method and the piecewise-linear basis functions.

Yet LLM based pipelines face deployment gaps, including hallucinations under weak constraints, fragile temporal and causal linking over long contexts and across documents, and limited long horizon knowledge management within a bounded context window. We argue that EE should be viewed as a system component that provides a cognitive scaffold for LLM centered solutions. Event schemas and slot constraints create interfaces for grounding and verification; event centric structures act as controlled intermediate representations for stepwise reasoning; event links support relation aware retrieval with graph based RAG; and event stores offer updatable episodic and agent memory beyond the context window. This survey covers EE in text and multimodal settings, organizing tasks and taxonomy, tracing method evolution from rule based and neural models to instruction driven and generative frameworks, and summarizing formulations, decoding strategies, architectures, representations, datasets, and evaluation. We also review cross lingual, low resource, and domain specific settings, and highlight open challenges and future directions for reliable event centric systems. Finally, we outline open challenges and future directions that are central to the LLM era, aiming to evolve EE from static extraction into a structurally reliable, agent ready perception and memory layer for open world systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e0b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\uff08EE\uff09\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06EE\u89c6\u4e3a\u652f\u6491LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u652f\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3001\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u53ef\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u50a8\u7b49\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u957f\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM-based\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u53d7\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5c06EE\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u62bd\u53d6\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u69fd\u4f4d\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u5730\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u5206\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u94fe\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\uff08Graph-based RAG\uff09\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u50a8\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684EE\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6f14\u8fdb\uff08\u4ece\u89c4\u5219/\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u6db5\u76d6\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u62bd\u53d6\u5e94\u6210\u4e3aLLM\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u5728\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u5177\u5907\u4ee3\u7406\u5c31\u7eea\uff08agent-ready\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional supervised classification, ZSL typically relies on learning a mapping from visual features to predefined, human-understandable class concepts. While ZSL models promise to improve generalization and interpretability, their robustness under systematic input perturbations remain unclear. In this study, we present an empirical analysis about the robustness of existing ZSL methods at both classlevel and concept-level. Specifically, we successfully disrupted their class prediction by the well-known non-target class attack (clsA). However, in the Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) setting, we observe that the success of clsA is only at the original best-calibrated point. After the attack, the optimal bestcalibration point shifts, and ZSL models maintain relatively strong performance at other calibration points, indicating that clsA results in a spurious attack success in the GZSL. To address this, we propose the Class-Bias Enhanced Attack (CBEA), which completely eliminates GZSL accuracy across all calibrated points by enhancing the gap between seen and unseen class probabilities.Next, at concept-level attack, we introduce two novel attack modes: Class-Preserving Concept Attack (CPconA) and NonClass-Preserving Concept Attack (NCPconA). Our extensive experiments evaluate three typical ZSL models across various architectures from the past three years and reveal that ZSL models are vulnerable not only to the traditional class attack but also to concept-based attacks. These attacks allow malicious actors to easily manipulate class predictions by erasing or introducing concepts. Our findings highlight a significant performance gap between existing approaches, emphasizing the need for improved adversarial robustness in current ZSL models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ZSL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u522b\u5747\u6613\u53d7\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684Class-Bias Enhanced Attack\uff08CBEA\uff09\u53ca\u4e24\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\uff08CPconA/NCPconA\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ZSL\u6a21\u578b\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ZSL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5f3a\u8c03\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08GZSL\uff09\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u653b\u51fbCBEA\u4ee5\u514b\u670dclsA\u5728GZSL\u4e2d\u4ec5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6821\u51c6\u70b9\u6709\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u653b\u51fbCPconA\u548cNCPconA\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u7834\u574f\u539f\u59cb\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u7c7b\u8fd1\u5e74\u4e3b\u6d41ZSL\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "clsA\u5728GZSL\u4e2d\u4ec5\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u6700\u4f18\u6821\u51c6\u70b9\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5c5e\u4f2a\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\uff1bCBEA\u53ef\u5f7b\u5e95\u6d88\u9664GZSL\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u70b9\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1bCPconA\u548cNCPconA\u5747\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5e72\u6270ZSL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9eZSL\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u9762\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dZSL\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u522b\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5bf9\u6297\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4ece\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We introduce DPSR (Differentially Private Sparse Reconstruction), a novel three-stage denoising framework that fundamentally addresses this limitation by exploiting the inherent structure of rating matrices -- sparsity, low-rank properties, and collaborative patterns.\n  DPSR consists of three synergistic stages: (1) \\textit{information-theoretic noise calibration} that adaptively reduces noise for high-information ratings, (2) \\textit{collaborative filtering-based denoising} that leverages item-item similarities to remove privacy noise, and (3) \\textit{low-rank matrix completion} that exploits latent structure for signal recovery. Critically, all denoising operations occur \\textit{after} noise injection, preserving differential privacy through the post-processing immunity theorem while removing both privacy-induced and inherent data noise.\n  Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled ground truth, we demonstrate that DPSR achieves 5.57\\% to 9.23\\% RMSE improvement over state-of-the-art Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms across privacy budgets ranging from $\\varepsilon=0.1$ to $\\varepsilon=10.0$ (all improvements statistically significant with $p < 0.05$, most $p < 0.001$). Remarkably, at $\\varepsilon=1.0$, DPSR achieves RMSE of 0.9823, \\textit{outperforming even the non-private baseline} (1.0983), demonstrating that our denoising pipeline acts as an effective regularizer that removes data noise in addition to privacy noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDPSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u53bb\u566a\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7a81\u7834\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u6536\u7d27\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\u5fc5\u7136\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDPSR\uff08\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7a00\u758f\u91cd\u5efa\uff09\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u6821\u51c6\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u540c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u53bb\u566a\uff1b3\uff09\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u5747\u5728\u52a0\u566a\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u540e\u5904\u7406\u514d\u75ab\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDPSR\u5728\u03b5=0.1\u523010.0\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8f83Laplace\u548cGaussian\u673a\u5236RMSE\u964d\u4f4e5.57%\u20139.23%\uff08p<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u03b5=1.0\u65f6RMSE\u8fbe0.9823\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u9690\u79c1\u57fa\u7ebf1.0983\u3002", "conclusion": "DPSR\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u540c\u6b65\u6d88\u9664\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5176\u53bb\u566a\u6d41\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u4e25\u683c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While existing methods struggle with view inconsistency and require per-scene training, we propose SplatBright, which is, to our knowledge, the first generalizable 3D Gaussian framework for joint low-light enhancement and reconstruction from sparse sRGB inputs. Our key idea is to integrate physically guided illumination modeling with geometry-appearance decoupling for consistent low-light reconstruction. Specifically, we adopt a dual-branch predictor that provides stable geometric initialization of 3D Gaussian parameters. On the appearance side, illumination consistency leverages frequency priors to enable controllable and cross-view coherent lighting, while an appearance refinement module further separates illumination, material, and view-dependent cues to recover fine texture. To tackle the lack of large-scale geometrically consistent paired data, we synthesize dark views via a physics-based camera model for training.

We systematically investigate the interplay between quantization precision (FP16, INT8, INT4) and replay buffer strategies in large language models, revealing unexpected dynamics. While FP16 achieves superior initial task performance (74.44% on NLU), we observe a striking inversion on subsequent tasks: quantized models outperform FP16 by 8-15% on final task forward accuracy, with INT4 achieving nearly double FP16's performance on Code generation (40% vs 20%). Critically, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) dramatically improve retention - increasing NLU retention after Math training from 45% to 65% across all precision levels - with INT8 consistently achieving the optimal balance between learning plasticity and knowledge retention. We hypothesize that quantization-induced noise acts as implicit regularization, preventing the overfitting to new task gradients that plagues high-precision models. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that higher precision is always preferable, suggesting instead that INT8 quantization offers both computational efficiency and superior continual learning dynamics. Our results provide practical guidelines for deploying compressed models in continual learning scenarios: small replay buffers (1-2%) suffice for NLU tasks, while Math and Code benefit from moderate buffers (5-10%), with quantized models requiring less replay than FP16 to achieve comparable retention.

Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS datasets, i.e., RSICD, RSITMD, and RS5M, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world mismatches and PMPs in RS image-text retrieval tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6b63\u8d1f\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u4f2a\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\uff08PMPs\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4f2a\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\uff08PMPs\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5373\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u6216\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6b63\u8d1f\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u663e\u5f0f\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff08\u6b63\uff09\u4e0e\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\uff08\u8d1f\uff09\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728RSICD\u3001RSITMD\u548cRS5M\u4e09\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u4f2a\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While several methods for hallucination mitigation have been proposed, they often compromise the model's capacity for video understanding and reasoning. In this work, we propose SmartSight, a pioneering step to address this issue in a training-free manner by leveraging the model's own introspective capabilities. Specifically, SmartSight generates multiple candidate responses to uncover low-hallucinated outputs that are often obscured by standard greedy decoding. It assesses the hallucination of each response using the Temporal Attention Collapse score, which measures whether the model over-focuses on trivial temporal regions of the input video when generating the response. To improve efficiency, SmartSight identifies the Visual Attention Vanishing point, enabling more accurate hallucination estimation and early termination of hallucinated responses, leading to a substantial reduction in decoding cost. Experiments show that SmartSight substantially lowers hallucinations for Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 10.59% on VRIPT-HAL, while simultaneously enhancing video understanding and reasoning, boosting performance on VideoMMMU by up to 8.86%. These results highlight SmartSight's effectiveness in improving the reliability of open-source Video-LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SmartSight \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Video-LLM\uff09\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7701\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u574d\u584c\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d88\u5931\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u65e9\u671f\u7ec8\u6b62\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa SmartSight \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u4ee5\u6316\u6398\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u574d\u584c\u5206\u6570\uff08TAC score\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u65e0\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff1b3\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d88\u5931\u70b9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u622a\u65ad\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728 VRIPT-HAL \u4e0a\u5c06 Qwen2.5-VL-7B \u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u964d\u4f4e 10.59%\uff1b\u5728 VideoMMMU \u4e0a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe 8.86%\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u89e3\u7801\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "SmartSight \u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u517c\u987e\u5e7b\u89c9\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684 Video-LLM \u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This leaves it unclear whether infant scale learning also supports attribute discrimination. To address this, we introduce a benchmark that systematically varies color, size, and texture, allowing controlled tests of within class attribute recognition. Comparing CVCL with CLIP shows clear differences. CVCL is better at size discrimination, while CLIP achieves higher accuracy on color discrimination.

Our study focuses on two extremely under-resourced languages: Bribri, a Chibchan language spoken in Costa Rica, and Cook Islands M\u0101ori, a Polynesian language spoken in the Cook Islands. Specifically, this paper: (i) compares algorithms for diacritics restoration in under-resourced languages, including tonal diacritics, (ii) examines the amount of data required to achieve target performance levels, (iii) contrasts results across varying resource conditions, and (iv) explores the related task of diacritic correction. We find that fine-tuned, character-level LLMs perform best, likely due to their ability to decompose complex characters into their UTF-8 byte representations. In contrast, massively multilingual models perform less effectively given our data constraints. Across all models, reliable performance begins to emerge with data budgets of around 10,000 words.

We propose an asynchronous inference mechanism that decouples these two, allowing the denoiser to be conditioned at a different, learned timestep while keeping image update schedule unchanged. A lightweight timestep prediction module (TPM), trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), selects a more feasible conditioning timestep based on the current state, effectively choosing a desired noise level to control image detail and textural richness.

Distributionally robust RL (DR-RL) addresses this issue by optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of transition dynamics.

We overcome these limitations by proposing an online DR-RL algorithm with general function approximation that learns an optimal robust policy purely through interaction with the environment, without requiring prior models or offline data, enabling deployment in high-dimensional tasks.

While supervised learning approaches dominate this field, the scarcity and high cost of annotated data for new domains present significant barriers. We argue that leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot setting is a practical alternative where resources for data annotation are limited. In this work, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique that utilises an intermediate Unified Meaning Representation (UMR) to structure the reasoning process for the ACSA task. We evaluate this UMR-based approach against a standard CoT baseline across three models (Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini-2.5-Pro) and four diverse datasets. Our findings suggest that UMR effectiveness may be model-dependent. Whilst preliminary results indicate comparable performance for mid-sized models such as Qwen3-8B, these observations warrant further investigation, particularly regarding the potential applicability to smaller model architectures.

Our approach is based on a novel lag operator, which geometrically derives the discrete-time recurrence by measuring how the system's basis functions \"slide\" and change from one timestep to the next. The resulting state matrices are computed via a single inner product involving this operator, offering a modular design space for creating novel SSMs by flexibly combining different basis functions and time-warping schemes. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that a specific instance exactly recovers the recurrence of the influential HiPPO model. Numerical simulations confirm our derivation, providing new theoretical tools for designing flexible and robust sequence models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u578b\u6ede\u540e\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u5757\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SSM\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u89c2\u6027\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6ede\u540e\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u5f0f\u63a8\u5bfc\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u9012\u5f52\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u77e9\u9635\u7531\u8be5\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0e\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u5185\u79ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u65f6\u53d8\u626d\u66f2\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u590d\u73b0HiPPO\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

The core insight is that general-purpose attention between patches learns temporal and spatial information for geometric reasoning. We demonstrate that appending a linear decoder to the Transformer backbone produces satisfactory results, and iterative refinement can further elevate performance to stateof-the-art levels.

Semi-supervised detection methods can utilize the supervision of partial labels, thus reducing false positive rates. However, most of the current semi-supervised methods focus on numerical data and neglect the heterogeneity of data information. In this paper, we propose a consistency-guided outlier detection algorithm (COD) for heterogeneous data with the fuzzy rough set theory in a semi-supervised manner. First, a few labeled outliers are leveraged to construct label-informed fuzzy similarity relations. Next, the consistency of the fuzzy decision system is introduced to evaluate attributes' contributions to knowledge classification. Subsequently, we define the outlier factor based on the fuzzy similarity class and predict outliers by integrating the classification consistency and the outlier factor. The proposed algorithm is extensively evaluated on 15 freshly proposed datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that COD is better than or comparable with the leading outlier detectors.

EcoSplat adopts a two-stage optimization process. The first stage is Pixel-aligned Gaussian Training (PGT) where our model learns initial primitive prediction. The second stage is Importance-aware Gaussian Finetuning (IGF) stage where our model learns rank primitives and adaptively adjust their parameters based on the target primitive count. Extensive experiments across multiple dense-view settings show that EcoSplat is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict primitive-count constraints, making it well-suited for flexible downstream rendering tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "EcoSplat \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u9ad8\u65af\u692d\u7403\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u9988\u5f0f3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08PGT\u548cIGF\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u9988\u5f0f3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u591a\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u692d\u7403\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6e32\u67d3\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5Pixel-aligned Gaussian Training\uff08PGT\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u521d\u59cb\u9ad8\u65af\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5Importance-aware Gaussian Finetuning\uff08IGF\uff09\u6839\u636e\u76ee\u6807\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u9ad8\u65af\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cEcoSplat\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EcoSplat\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u524d\u9988\u5f0f3DGS\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6309\u9700\u63a7\u5236\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Semi-supervised methods improve detection performance by leveraging partially labeled data but typically overlook the uncertainty and heterogeneity of real-world mixed-attribute data. This paper introduces a semi-supervised outlier detection method, namely fuzzy rough sets-based outlier detection (FROD), to effectively handle these challenges. Specifically, we first utilize a small subset of labeled data to construct fuzzy decision systems, through which we introduce the attribute classification accuracy based on fuzzy approximations to evaluate the contribution of attribute sets in outlier detection. Unlabeled data is then used to compute fuzzy relative entropy, which provides a characterization of outliers from the perspective of uncertainty. Finally, we develop the detection algorithm by combining attribute classification accuracy with fuzzy relative entropy. Experimental results on 16 public datasets show that FROD is comparable with or better than leading detection algorithms.

In this paper, we introduce the Unified Rectification Framework (UniRect), a comprehensive approach that addresses these practical tasks from a consistent distortion rectification perspective. Our approach incorporates various task-specific inverse problems into a general distortion model by simulating different types of lenses. To handle diverse distortions, UniRect adopts one task-agnostic rectification framework with a dual-component structure: a {Deformation Module}, which utilizes a novel Residual Progressive Thin-Plate Spline (RP-TPS) model to address complex geometric deformations, and a subsequent Restoration Module, which employs Residual Mamba Blocks (RMBs) to counteract the degradation caused by the deformation process and enhance the fidelity of the output image. Moreover, a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) structure is designed to circumvent heavy task competition in multi-task learning due to varying distortions.

Most existing methods use Gaussian processes (GP) as the surrogate model for approximating the black-box objective function, it is well-known that it can fail in high-dimensional space (e.g., dimension over 500). We argue that the reliance of GP on precise numerical fitting is fundamentally ill-suited in high-dimensional space, where it leads to prohibitive computational complexity. In order to address this, we propose a simple order-preserving Bayesian optimization (OPBO) method, where the surrogate model preserves the order, instead of the value, of the black-box objective function. Then we can use a simple but effective OP neural network (NN) to replace GP as the surrogate model. Moreover, instead of searching for the best solution from the acquisition model, we select good-enough solutions in the ordinal set to reduce computational cost. The experimental results show that for high-dimensional (over 500) black-box optimization problems, the proposed OPBO significantly outperforms traditional BO methods based on regression NN and GP.

We introduce R-GenIMA, an interpretable multimodal large language model that couples a novel ROI-wise vision transformer with genetic prompting to jointly model structural MRI and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variations. By representing each anatomically parcellated brain region as a visual token and encoding SNP profiles as structured text, the framework enables cross-modal attention that links regional atrophy patterns to underlying genetic factors. Applied to the ADNI cohort, R-GenIMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in four-way classification across normal cognition (NC), subjective memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Beyond predictive accuracy, the model yields biologically meaningful explanations by identifying stage-specific brain regions and gene signatures, as well as coherent ROI-Gene association patterns across the disease continuum. Attention-based attribution revealed genes consistently enriched for established GWAS-supported AD risk loci, including APOE, BIN1, CLU, and RBFOX1. Stage-resolved neuroanatomical signatures identified shared vulnerability hubs across disease stages alongside stage-specific patterns: striatal involvement in subjective decline, frontotemporal engagement during prodromal impairment, and consolidated multimodal network disruption in AD. These results demonstrate that interpretable multimodal AI can synthesize imaging and genetics to reveal mechanistic insights, providing a foundation for clinically deployable tools that enable earlier risk stratification and inform precision therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86R-GenIMA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784MRI\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9token\u3001SNP\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728ADNI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86NC/SMC/MCI/AD\u56db\u5206\u7c7bSOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u8111\u533a-\u57fa\u56e0\u5173\u8054\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u6574\u5408\u5b8f\u89c2\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u5fae\u89c2\u9057\u4f20\u6613\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f02\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR-GenIMA\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408ROI-wise\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4e0e\u9057\u4f20\u63d0\u793a\uff08genetic prompting\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8111\u533a\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0cSNP\u8c31\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u533a\u57df\u840e\u7f29\u4e0e\u9057\u4f20\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728ADNI\u961f\u5217\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u56db\u5206\u7c7bSOTA\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8111\u533a\uff08\u5982\u4e3b\u89c2\u8870\u9000\u671f\u7eb9\u72b6\u4f53\u3001MCI\u671f\u989d\u989e\u53f6\u3001AD\u671f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u53caAD\u98ce\u9669\u57fa\u56e0\uff08APOE\u3001BIN1\u3001CLU\u3001RBFOX1\uff09\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0ROI-\u57fa\u56e0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5173\u8054\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u80fd\u878d\u5408\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u9057\u4f20\u6570\u636e\u63ed\u793aAD\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u65e9\u671f\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u4e0e\u7cbe\u51c6\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, their capacity to comprehend the dynamic changes of objects within a shared spatial context between two distinct video observations, remains largely unexplored. This ability to reason about transformations within a consistent environment is particularly crucial for advancements in the field of spatial intelligence. In this paper, we introduce $M^3-Verse$, a Multi-Modal, Multi-State, Multi-Dimensional benchmark, to formally evaluate this capability. It is built upon paired videos that provide multi-perspective observations of an indoor scene before and after a state change. The benchmark contains a total of 270 scenes and 2,932 questions, which are categorized into over 50 subtasks that probe 4 core capabilities. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art LMMs and observe their limitations in tracking state transitions. To address these challenges, we further propose a simple yet effective baseline that achieves significant performance improvements in multi-state perception. $M^3-Verse$ thus provides a challenging new testbed to catalyze the development of next-generation models with a more holistic understanding of our dynamic visual world.

VNN-COMP is held annually to facilitate the fair and objective comparison of state-of-the-art neural network verification tools, encourage the standardization of tool interfaces, and bring together the neural network verification community.

We study the training dynamics of neural networks under DP by comparing Gradient Descent (GD), and Adam to their privacy-preserving variants. Prior work shows that these optimizers exhibit distinct stability dynamics: full-batch methods train at the Edge of Stability (EoS), while mini-batch and adaptive methods exhibit analogous edge-of-stability behavior. At these regimes, the training loss and the sharpness--the maximum eigenvalue of the training loss Hessian--exhibit certain characteristic behavior. In DP training, per-example gradient clipping and Gaussian noise modify the update rule, and it is unclear whether these stability patterns persist. We analyze how clipping and noise change sharpness and loss evolution and show that while DP generally reduces the sharpness and can prevent optimizers from fully reaching the classical stability thresholds, patterns from EoS and analogous adaptive methods stability regimes persist, with the largest learning rates and largest privacy budgets approaching, and sometimes exceeding, these thresholds. These findings highlight the unpredictability introduced by DP in neural network optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u7387\uff08sharpness\uff09\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u8fbe\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fb9\u7f18\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08EoS\uff09\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u903c\u8fd1\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u8be5\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86DP\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u6cc4\u9732\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6539\u53d8\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790GD\u3001Adam\u53ca\u5176DP\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u66f2\u7387\uff08Hessian\u6700\u5927\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff09\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76DP\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "DP\u901a\u5e38\u964d\u4f4esharpness\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8fbe\u5230\u7ecf\u5178Edge of Stability\uff08EoS\uff09\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u4f46EoS\u53ca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ecd\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u8f83\u5927\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u53ef\u903c\u8fd1\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u8be5\u9608\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "DP\u867d\u6291\u5236\u90e8\u5206\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u672a\u6d88\u9664\u6838\u5fc3\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3DP\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, current open multimodal agents still largely fall short on the reasoning aspect crucial for real-world tasks like analyzing documents with dense charts/diagrams and navigating maps. To address this gap, we introduce O3-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning with interleaved attention to visual details. O3-Bench features challenging problems that require agents to piece together subtle visual information from distinct image areas through multi-step reasoning. The problems are highly challenging even for frontier systems like OpenAI o3, which only obtains 40.8% accuracy on O3-Bench. To make progress, we propose InSight-o3, a multi-agent framework consisting of a visual reasoning agent (vReasoner) and a visual search agent (vSearcher) for which we introduce the task of generalized visual search -- locating relational, fuzzy, or conceptual regions described in free-form language, beyond just simple objects or figures in natural images. We then present a multimodal LLM purpose-trained for this task via reinforcement learning.

However, current approaches in long video generation typically rely on window attention, which naively discards historical context outside the window, leading to catastrophic forgetting and scene inconsistency; conversely, retaining full history incurs prohibitive memory costs. To address this trade-off, we propose \\textbf{Memorize-and-Generate (MAG)}, a framework that decouples memory compression and frame generation into distinct tasks. Specifically, we train a memory model to compress historical information into a compact KV cache, and a separate generator model to synthesize subsequent frames utilizing this compressed representation. Furthermore, we introduce \\textbf{MAG-Bench} to strictly evaluate historical memory retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAG achieves superior historical scene consistency while maintaining competitive performance on standard video generation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMemorize-and-Generate\uff08MAG\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u5168\u5386\u53f2\u4fdd\u7559\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1MAG-Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e22\u5931\uff08\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u800c\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u90e8\u5386\u53f2\u53c8\u5e26\u6765\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMAG\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u7f13\u5b58\u5408\u6210\u540e\u7eed\u5e27\uff1b\u5e76\u6784\u5efaMAG-Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "MAG\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5386\u53f2\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u8bb0\u5fc6\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff0cMAG\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08surrogate modeling\uff09\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5316CFD\u9a71\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u95ed\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4f20\u7edfCFD\u9a71\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6240\u9700\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCFD\u9a71\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u767e\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u6b21\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fCFD\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6982\u7387\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7b26\u53f7\u5316CFD\u9a71\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff1a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2CFD\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4bML\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7ecf\u5e73\u5747\u8f93\u5165-\u7b26\u53f7\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u540e\u8f93\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u77e9\u9635\u6838\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u4f9d\u636e\u5176\u5747\u503c\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u6267\u884c\u5168CFD\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e00\u7ef4\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u542b\u5355/\u591a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u539f\u59cbCFD\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684CFD\u9a71\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u95ed\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6e4d\u6d41\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To maintain a comfortable indoor environment and minimize the contribution of the building to climate change as much as possible, higher requirements are placed on the operation and control of HVAC systems, e.g., more energy-efficient and flexible to response to the rapid change of weather. This places demands on the rapid modeling and prediction of zone air temperatures of buildings. Compared to the traditional simulation-based approach such as EnergyPlus and DOE2, a hybrid approach combined physics and data-driven is more suitable. Recently, the availability of high-quality datasets and algorithmic breakthroughs have driven a considerable amount of work in this field. However, in the niche of short- and long-term predictions, there are still some gaps in existing research. This paper aims to develop a time series forecast model to predict the zone air temperature in a building located in America on a 2-week horizon. The findings could be further improved to support intelligent control and operation of HVAC systems (i.e. demand flexibility) and could also be used as hybrid building energy modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7f8e\u56fd\u67d0\u5efa\u7b51\u533a\u57df\u7a7a\u6c14\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4e24\u5468\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u652f\u6301HVAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\uff08\u5982\u9700\u6c42\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff09\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u8017\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u6781\u7aef\u548c\u7a81\u53d1\u5929\u6c14\u9891\u53d1\uff0c\u5bf9HVAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u2014\u2014\u9700\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u54cd\u5e94\u5929\u6c14\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u4e9f\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u533a\u57df\u6e29\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u673a\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u5411\u4e24\u5468\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u533a\u57df\u7a7a\u6c14\u6e29\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u67d0\u5efa\u7b51\u7684\u4e24\u5468\u5c3a\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u7a7a\u6c14\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u652f\u6301HVAC\u667a\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u80fd\u8017\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u77ed-\u957f\u671f\u5efa\u7b51\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5efa\u7b51\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u97e7\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing token pruning strategies are inadequate: LLM-stage token pruning overlooks the ViT's overhead, while conventional ViT token pruning, without language guidance, risks discarding textually critical visual cues and introduces feature distortions amplified by the ViT's bidirectional attention. To meet these challenges, we propose IPCV, a training-free, information-preserving compression framework for MLLM visual encoders. IPCV enables aggressive token pruning inside the ViT via Neighbor-Guided Reconstruction (NGR) that temporarily reconstructs pruned tokens to participate in attention with minimal overhead, then fully restores them before passing to the LLM. Besides, we introduce Attention Stabilization (AS) to further alleviate the negative influence from token pruning by approximating the K/V of pruned tokens. It can be directly applied to previous LLM-side token pruning methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments show that IPCV substantially reduces end-to-end computation and outperforms state-of-the-art training-free token compression methods across diverse image and video benchmarks.

Human feedback is costly and time-consuming to obtain, which creates demand for data-efficient query selection methods. This work presents a novel approach that leverages optimal experimental design to ask humans the most informative preference queries, from which we can elucidate the latent reward function modeling user preferences efficiently. We formulate the problem of preference query selection as the one that maximizes the information about the underlying latent preference model.

However, despite significant progress, LVLMs still suffer from severe hallucination issues in object recognition tasks. These models often fail to accurately identify certain objects, leading to text generation that appears fluent but does not correspond to the visual content, which can have serious consequences in real-world applications. Recently, several methods have been proposed to alleviate LVLM hallucinations, but most focus solely on reducing hallucinations in the language modality. To mitigate hallucinations in both the language and visual modalities, we introduce Hallucination Disentangled Decoding (HDD) method that requires no training. HDD enhances the original image by segmenting it and selecting images that augment the original, while also utilizing a blank image to eliminate language prior hallucinations in both the original and segmented images. This design not only reduces the model's dependence on language priors but also enhances its visual performance.

Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \\emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \\emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters.

Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data.

The core factor is that policy optimization requires accounting for the probability likelihood of each step due to its multi-step and iterative refinement process. This reliance on entire sampling trajectories introduces high computational cost, whereas natively optimizing random steps often yields suboptimal results. In this paper, we present MaskFocus, a novel RL framework that achieves effective policy optimization for masked generative models by focusing on critical steps. Specifically, we determine the step-level information gain by measuring the similarity between the intermediate images at each sampling step and the final generated image. Crucially, we leverage this to identify the most critical and valuable steps and execute focused policy optimization on them. Furthermore, we design a dynamic routing sampling mechanism based on entropy to encourage the model to explore more valuable masking strategies for samples with low entropy.

Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO", "summary": "Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches treat large language models (LLMs) as a single unified policy, overlooking their internal mechanisms. Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training.

However, these models have primarily focused on modalities like text, images, and depth maps, while strictly time-synchronous signals like audio have been underexplored. This paper introduces In-Context Audio Control of video diffusion transformers (ICAC), a framework that investigates the integration of audio signals for speech-driven video generation within a unified full-attention architecture, akin to FullDiT. We systematically explore three distinct mechanisms for injecting audio conditions: standard cross-attention, 2D self-attention, and unified 3D self-attention. Our findings reveal that while 3D attention offers the highest potential for capturing spatio-temporal audio-visual correlations, it presents significant training challenges. To overcome this, we propose a Masked 3D Attention mechanism that constrains the attention pattern to enforce temporal alignment, enabling stable training and superior performance. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong lip synchronization and video quality, conditioned on an audio stream and reference images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86In-Context Audio Control (ICAC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563Transformer\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faMasked 3D Attention\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5507\u5f62\u540c\u6b65\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u97f3\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faICAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3cFullDiT\u7684\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u97f3\u9891\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u30012D\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u7edf\u4e003D\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u9488\u5bf93D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Masked 3D Attention\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "Masked 3D Attention\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u5507\u5f62\u540c\u6b65\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u97f3\u9891\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u6d41\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u97f3\u9891\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0cMasked 3D Attention\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We developed PROGRESS (PRognostic Generalization from REsting Static Signatures), a dual-model deep learning framework that transforms a single baseline cerebrospinal fluid biomarker assessment into actionable prognostic estimates without requiring prior clinical history. The framework addresses two complementary clinical questions: a probabilistic trajectory network predicts individualized cognitive decline with calibrated uncertainty bounds achieving near-nominal coverage, enabling honest prognostic communication; and a deep survival model estimates time to conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Using data from over 3,000 participants across 43 Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database, PROGRESS substantially outperforms Cox proportional hazards, Random Survival Forests, and gradient boosting methods for survival prediction. Risk stratification identifies patient groups with seven-fold differences in conversion rates, enabling clinically meaningful treatment prioritization. Leave-one-center-out validation demonstrates robust generalizability, with survival discrimination remaining strong across held-out sites despite heterogeneous measurement conditions spanning four decades of assay technologies.

Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFAIR-k\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728OAC-FL\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u517c\u987e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5e45\u503c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6765\u9009\u62e9top-k\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed9\u51fa\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3OAC-FL\u4e2d\u6b63\u4ea4\u6ce2\u5f62\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFAIR-k\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u878d\u5408Round-Robin\uff08\u4fdd\u969c\u66f4\u65b0\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6/\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff09\u4e0eTop-k\uff08\u805a\u7126\u5927\u68af\u5ea6\u5e45\u503c\uff09\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5206\u6790\u523b\u753b\u53c2\u6570\u9648\u65e7\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9648\u65e7\u5ea6\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eFAIR-k\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6216\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FAIR-k\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u4e0e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86OAC-FL\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

While existing methods often rely on additional genre labels to further improve dance generation, such labels are typically noisy, coarse, unavailable, or insufficient to capture the diversity of real-world music, which can result in rhythm misalignment or stylistic drift. In contrast, we observe that tempo, a core property reflecting musical rhythm and pace, remains relatively consistent across datasets and genres, typically ranging from 60 to 200 BPM. Based on this finding, we propose TempoMoE, a hierarchical tempo-aware Mixture-of-Experts module that enhances the diffusion model and its rhythm perception. TempoMoE organizes motion experts into tempo-structured groups for different tempo ranges, with multi-scale beat experts capturing fine- and long-range rhythmic dynamics. A Hierarchical Rhythm-Adaptive Routing dynamically selects and fuses experts from music features, enabling flexible, rhythm-aligned generation without manual genre labels.

Achieving sub-minute orchestration of renewables, storage, and loads, while minimizing PUE and lifecycle carbon intensity, hinges on accurate load forecasting. However, existing methods struggle to address small-sample scenarios caused by cold start, load distortion, multi-source data fragmentation, and distribution shifts in green data centers. We introduce HyperLoad, a cross-modality framework that exploits pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to overcome data scarcity. In the Cross-Modality Knowledge Alignment phase, textual priors and time-series data are mapped to a common latent space, maximizing the utility of prior knowledge.

Methods: Our CA architecture first processes the iEEG signal using state-of-the-art models applied to each single channel independently. The resulting features are then fused using a vector-symbolic algorithm which reconstructs the spatial relationship using a trainable scalar per channel. Finally, the fused features are accumulated in a long-term memory of up to 2 minutes to perform the classification. Each CA-model can then be pre-trained on a large corpus of iEEG recordings from multiple heterogeneous subjects. The pre-trained model is personalized to each subject via a quick fine-tuning routine, which uses equal or lower amounts of data compared to existing state-of-the-art models, but requiring only 1/5 of the time. Results: We evaluate our CA-models on a seizure detection task both on a short-term (~20 hours) and a long-term (~2500 hours) dataset. In particular, our CA-EEGWaveNet is trained on a single seizure of the tested subject, while the baseline EEGWaveNet is trained on all but one. Even in this challenging scenario, our CA-EEGWaveNet surpasses the baseline in median F1-score (0.78 vs 0.76). Similarly, CA-EEGNet based on EEGNet, also surpasses its baseline in median F1-score (0.79 vs 0.74). Conclusion and significance: Our CA-model addresses two issues: first, it is channel-adaptive and can therefore be trained across heterogeneous subjects without loss of performance; second, it increases the effective temporal context size to a clinically-relevant length. Therefore, our model is a drop-in replacement for existing models, bringing better characteristics and performance across the board.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u9053\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08CA\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u901a\u9053\u6570\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fiEEG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u901a\u9053\u72ec\u7acb\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7d2f\u79ef\u5b9e\u73b0 seizure \u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u53d1\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5373\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709iEEG\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\uff08\u56e0\u901a\u9053\u914d\u7f6e\u5f02\u6784\uff09\u53ca\u6709\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77ed\uff08\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u7ea62\u5206\u949f\uff09\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5404\u901a\u9053\u72ec\u7acb\u91c7\u7528SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u91cf\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u7b26\u53f7\u7b97\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u91cd\u5efa\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u9001\u5165\u6700\u957f\u53ef\u8fbe2\u5206\u949f\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b4\uff09\u5148\u5728\u591a\u88ab\u8bd5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21iEEG\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5feb\u901f\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\uff08~20\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u548c\u957f\u65f6\uff08~2500\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1aCA-EEGWaveNet\uff08\u4ec5\u75281\u6b21\u53d1\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09F1\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u8fbe0.78\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf0.76\uff1bCA-EEGNet\u8fbe0.79\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf0.74\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u8017\u65f6\u4ec51/5\u3002", "conclusion": "CA\u67b6\u6784\u517c\u5177\u901a\u9053\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u957f\u65f6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\u3002"}}

This work presents a systematic analysis of the internal evolution of visual perception and token generation in LVLMs, revealing two key patterns. First, perception follows a three-stage GATE process: early layers perform a Global scan, intermediate layers Approach and Tighten on core content, and later layers Explore supplementary regions. Second, generation exhibits an SAD (Subdominant Accumulation to Dominant) pattern, where hallucinated tokens arise from the repeated accumulation of subdominant tokens lacking support from attention (visual perception) or feed-forward network (internal knowledge). Guided by these findings, we devise the VDC (Validated Dominance Correction) strategy, which detects unsupported tokens and replaces them with validated dominant ones to improve output reliability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks confirm that VDC substantially mitigates hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u9075\u5faa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5GATE\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5448\u73b0SAD\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faVDC\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u7f3a\u4e4f\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bcd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u529b\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790LVLMs\u5185\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0etoken\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51faGATE\u611f\u77e5\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u548cSAD\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1VDC\uff08Validated Dominance Correction\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u66ff\u6362\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6216FFN\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfctoken\u3002", "result": "VDC\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLVLMs\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b50\u4e3b\u5bfctoken\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u652f\u6301\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u7d2f\u79ef\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0d\u652f\u6301token\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This limitation stems from the intrinsic constraints of pixel-only training objectives, which inherently bias models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of learning underlying kinematic principles. To address this, we introduce EchoMotion, a framework designed to model the joint distribution of appearance and human motion, thereby improving the quality of complex human action video generation. EchoMotion extends the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) framework with a dual-branch architecture that jointly processes tokens concatenated from different modalities. Furthermore, we propose MVS-RoPE (Motion-Video Syncronized RoPE), which offers unified 3D positional encoding for both video and motion tokens. By providing a synchronized coordinate system for the dual-modal latent sequence, MVS-RoPE establishes an inductive bias that fosters temporal alignment between the two modalities. We also propose a Motion-Video Two-Stage Training Strategy. This strategy enables the model to perform both the joint generation of complex human action videos and their corresponding motion sequences, as well as versatile cross-modal conditional generation tasks. To facilitate the training of a model with these capabilities, we construct HuMoVe, a large-scale dataset of approximately 80,000 high-quality, human-centric video-motion pairs.

Nevertheless, the existing industrial hybrid modeling methods still face two main limitations. First, current research has mainly focused on applying a single machine learning method to one specific task, failing to develop a comprehensive machine learning architecture suitable for modeling tasks, which limits their ability to effectively represent complex industrial scenarios. Second, industrial datasets often contain underlying associations (e.g., monotonicity or periodicity) that are not adequately exploited by current research, which can degrade model's predictive performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Recurrent Perceptron-based Channel Attention Transformer Encoder (RP-CATE), with three distinctive characteristics: 1: We developed a novel architecture by replacing the self-attention mechanism with channel attention and incorporating our proposed Recurrent Perceptron (RP) Module into Transformer, achieving enhanced effectiveness for industrial modeling tasks compared to the original Transformer. 2: We proposed a new data type called Pseudo-Image Data (PID) tailored for channel attention requirements and developed a cyclic sliding window method for generating PID. 3: We introduced the concept of Pseudo-Sequential Data (PSD) and a method for converting industrial datasets into PSD, which enables the RP Module to capture the underlying associations within industrial dataset more effectively. An experiment aimed at hybrid modeling in chemical engineering was conducted by using RP-CATE and the experimental results demonstrate that RP-CATE achieves the best performance compared to other baseline models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5de5\u4e1a\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5RP-CATE\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u5faa\u73af\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u6a21\u5757\u6539\u8fdbTransformer\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff08PID\uff09\u548c\u4f2a\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff08PSD\uff09\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u6316\u6398\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u3001\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7b49\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRP-CATE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08RP\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff1b2\uff09\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff08PID\uff09\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5faa\u73af\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4f2a\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff08PSD\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7fRP\u6a21\u5757\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u6355\u83b7\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5316\u5de5\u9886\u57df\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cRP-CATE\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "RP-CATE\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u8868\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5de5\u4e1a\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

However, despite the progress, the interpretability of neural representations remains limited. A significant challenge arises from the intrinsic properties of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, including high noise levels, spatial diffusion, and pronounced temporal variability. To interpret the neural mechanism underlying thoughts, we propose a transformers-based framework to extract spatial-temporal representations associated with observed visual stimuli from EEG recordings. These features are subsequently incorporated into the attention mechanisms of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to facilitate the reconstruction of visual stimuli from brain activity. The quantitative evaluations on publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method excels at modeling the semantic structures from EEG signals; achieving up to 6.5% increase in latent space clustering accuracy and 11.8% increase in zero shot generalization across unseen classes while having comparable Inception Score and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance with existing baselines.

A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

Through a formative study, we define this challenge and categorize tampering techniques into two primary types: data manipulation and visual encoding manipulation. To address this, we present VizDefender, a framework for tampering detection and analysis. The framework integrates two core components: 1) a semi-fragile watermark module that protects the visualization by embedding a location map to images, which allows for the precise localization of tampered regions while preserving visual quality, and 2) an intent analysis module that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret manipulation, inferring the attacker's intent and misleading effects. Extensive evaluations and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VizDefender\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7be1\u6539\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u534a\u8106\u5f31\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7be1\u6539\u533a\u57df\uff09\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u610f\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6b63\u53d7\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u5fae\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u7684\u7be1\u6539\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVizDefender\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u56fe\u7684\u534a\u8106\u5f31\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u62a4\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7be1\u6539\u533a\u57df\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u8bfb\u7be1\u6539\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u8bef\u5bfc\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VizDefender\u4e3a\u4fdd\u969c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6c34\u5370\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u610f\u56fe\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

This neglects that the quantum and classical branches constitute distinct computational modalities and limits reliable performance on complex, high dimensional tabular and semi structured data, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics. We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases. These findings suggest that quantum derived information becomes most valuable when integrated through principled multimodal fusion rather than used in isolation or loosely appended to classical features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e2d\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6574\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b64\u7acb\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u62fc\u63a5\u5176\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e8c\u8005\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u683c\u548c\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u9065\u611f\u3001\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\uff09\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u7ecf\u5178\u8868\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff08query\uff09\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7279\u5f81token\u4f5c\u4e3a\u952e\uff08key\uff09\u548c\u503c\uff08value\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u91cf\u5b50\u5206\u652f\u63a7\u5236\u5728NISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u53ef\u884c\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff08\u6700\u591a9\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728Wine\u3001Breast Cancer\u3001Forest CoverType\u3001FashionMNIST\u548cSteelPlatesFaults\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7eaf\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u62fc\u63a5\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u6d4b\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u4e2d\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u5177\u5907\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u884d\u751f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9075\u5faa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u4f7f\u7528\u6216\u677e\u6563\u62fc\u63a5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages cross-modal decompositionality and image-specific concepts to create counterfactual scenarios expressed in natural language. We apply the proposed interpretability framework, termed Decompose and Explain (DeX), to the challenging domain of image privacy decisions, which are contextual and subjective. This application enables the quantification of the differential contributions of key scene elements to the model prediction. We identify relevant decision factors via a multi-criterion selection mechanism that considers both image similarity for minimal perturbations and decision confidence to prioritize impactful changes. This approach evaluates and compares diverse explanations, and assesses the interdependency and mutual influence among explanatory properties. By leveraging image-specific concepts, DeX generates image-grounded, sparse explanations, yielding significant improvements over the state of the art.

Final version forthcoming", "summary": "This paper presents novel generalization bounds for vector-valued neural networks and deep kernel methods, focusing on multi-task learning through an operator-theoretic framework. Our key development lies in strategically combining a Koopman based approach with existing techniques, achieving tighter generalization guarantees compared to traditional norm-based bounds. To mitigate computational challenges associated with Koopman-based methods, we introduce sketching techniques applicable to vector valued neural networks. These techniques yield excess risk bounds under generic Lipschitz losses, providing performance guarantees for applications including robust and multiple quantile regression.

Crash video analysis is a challenging multitask problem due to the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of crash events in video data and the diverse analytical requirements involved. It requires capabilities spanning crash recognition, temporal grounding, and high-level video understanding. Existing models, however, cannot perform all these tasks within a unified framework, and effective training strategies for such models remain underexplored. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes CrashChat, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for multitask traffic crash analysis, built upon VideoLLaMA3. CrashChat acquires domain-specific knowledge through instruction fine-tuning and employs a novel multitask learning strategy based on task decoupling and grouping, which maximizes the benefit of joint learning within and across task groups while mitigating negative transfer. Numerical experiments on consolidated public datasets demonstrate that CrashChat consistently outperforms existing MLLMs across model scales and traditional vision-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It reaches near-perfect accuracy in crash recognition, a 176\\% improvement in crash localization, and a 40\\% improvement in the more challenging pre-crash localization. Compared to general MLLMs, it substantially enhances textual accuracy and content coverage in crash description and reasoning tasks, with 0.18-0.41 increases in BLEU scores and 0.18-0.42 increases in ROUGE scores. Beyond its strong performance, CrashChat is a convenient, end-to-end analytical tool ready for practical implementation.

These are spurious cues which are associated with output labels in the training data but are unrelated to task semantics. When the shortcut features are associated with sensitive attributes, shortcut learning can lead to biased model performance. Existing methods for localising and understanding shortcut learning are mostly based upon qualitative, image-level inspection and assume cues are human-visible, limiting their use in domains such as medical imaging. We introduce OSCAR (Ordinal Scoring Correlations for Attribution Representations), a model-agnostic framework for quantifying shortcut learning and localising shortcut features. OSCAR converts image-level task attribution maps into dataset-level rank profiles of image regions and compares them across three models: a balanced baseline model (BA), a test model (TS), and a sensitive attribute predictor (SA). By computing pairwise, partial, and deviation-based correlations on these rank profiles, we produce a set of quantitative metrics that characterise the degree of shortcut reliance for TS, together with a ranking of image-level regions that contribute most to it. Experiments on CelebA, CheXpert, and ADNI show that our correlations are (i) stable across seeds and partitions, (ii) sensitive to the level of association between shortcut features and output labels in the training data, and (iii) able to distinguish localised from diffuse shortcut features. As an illustration of the utility of our method, we show how worst-group performance disparities can be reduced using a simple test-time attenuation approach based on the identified shortcut regions. OSCAR provides a lightweight, pixel-space audit that yields statistical decision rules and spatial maps, enabling users to test, localise, and mitigate shortcut reliance.

Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation. We find that an effective low-bit KV cache quantization strategy must consider two factors: a key channel's intrinsic quantization difficulty and its relevance to the query.

Existing solutions for this problem are limited by either the usage of a large and rigid list of vocabularies or by the dependency on complex pipelines with fragile heuristics where errors propagate across stages. Meanwhile, the ability of recent large multi-modal models (LMMs) equipped with explicit or implicit reasoning to comprehend visual-language data, decompose problems, retrieve latent knowledge, and self-correct suggests a more principled and effective alternative. Building on these capabilities, we propose FiNDR (Fine-grained Name Discovery via Reasoning), the first reasoning-augmented LMM-based framework for vocabulary-free fine-grained recognition. The system operates in three automated steps: (i) a reasoning-enabled LMM generates descriptive candidate labels for each image; (ii) a vision-language model filters and ranks these candidates to form a coherent class set; and (iii) the verified names instantiate a lightweight multi-modal classifier used at inference time. Extensive experiments on popular fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance under the vocabulary-free setting, with a significant relative margin of up to 18.8% over previous approaches. Remarkably, the proposed method surpasses zero-shot baselines that exploit pre-defined ground-truth names, challenging the assumption that human-curated vocabularies define an upper bound.

This raises a basic question: is there a general, modality-agnostic way to quantify how acquisition itself preserves or destroys the information that downstream learners could use? Here we propose an acquisition-level scalar $\u0394S_{\\mathcal B}$ based on instrument-resolved phase space. Unlike pixelwise distortion or purely spectral errors that often saturate under aggressive undersampling, $\u0394S_{\\mathcal B}$ directly quantifies how acquisition mixes or removes joint space--frequency structure at the instrument scale. We show theoretically that \\(\u0394S_{\\mathcal B}\\) correctly identifies the phase-space coherence of periodic sampling as the physical source of aliasing, recovering classical sampling-theorem consequences. Empirically, across masked image classification, accelerated MRI, and massive MIMO (including over-the-air measurements), $|\u0394S_{\\mathcal B}|$ consistently ranks sampling geometries and predicts downstream reconstruction/recognition difficulty \\emph{without training}. In particular, minimizing $|\u0394S_{\\mathcal B}|$ enables zero-training selection of variable-density MRI mask parameters that matches designs tuned by conventional pre-reconstruction criteria. These results suggest that phase-space entropy at acquisition reflects downstream learnability, enabling pre-training selection of candidate sampling policies and as a shared notion of information preservation across modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u91c7\u96c6\u7ea7\u6807\u91cf\u0394S_B\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u6216\u7834\u574f\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eea\u5668\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u71b5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u96be\u5ea6\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u91c7\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u7834\u574f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eea\u5668\u5206\u8fa8\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u91c7\u96c6\u7ea7\u6807\u91cf\u0394S_B\uff0c\u4ece\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u71b5\u89d2\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\u91c7\u96c6\u5bf9\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a-\u9891\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6df7\u53e0\u6216\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8054\u7cfb\u7ecf\u5178\u91c7\u6837\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u63a9\u7801\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u52a0\u901fMRI\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u0394S_B\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316|\u0394S_B|\u53ef\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u9009\u51fa\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u53d8\u5bc6\u5ea6MRI\u91c7\u6837\u63a9\u7801\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u96c6\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u71b5\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

However, the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens remains a major bottleneck. A critical component in this pipeline is the visual projector, which bridges the vision encoder and the language model. Standard designs often employ a simple multi-layer perceptron for direct token mapping, but this approach scales poorly with high-resolution inputs, introducing significant redundancy. We present Delta-LLaVA, a token-efficient projector that employs a low-rank DeltaProjection to align multi-level vision features into a compact subspace before further interaction. On top of this base alignment, lightweight Transformer blocks act as specialization layers, capturing both global and local structure under constrained token budgets. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that this base-then-specialize design yields consistent gains across multiple benchmarks with only 144 tokens, highlighting the importance of token formation prior to scaling interaction capacity.

However, in complex industrial scenarios, the issue of insufficient data volume persists, which diminishes the reliability of soft sensing. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are one of the effective solutions for addressing insufficient samples. Nevertheless, traditional GAN fail to account for the mapping relationship between labels and features, which limits further performance improvement. Although some studies have proposed solutions, none have considered both performance and efficiency simultaneously. To address these problems, this paper proposes the multi-task learning-based regression GAN framework that integrates regression information into both the discriminator and generator, and implements a shallow sharing mechanism between the discriminator and regressor. This approach significantly enhances the quality of generated samples while improving the algorithm's operational efficiency. Moreover, considering the importance of training samples and generated samples, a dual data evaluation strategy is designed to make GAN generate more diverse samples, thereby increasing the generalization of subsequent modeling.

Beyond optimization, understanding the relative importance and interaction of hyperparameters is critical to efficient model development. In this paper, we introduce MetaSHAP, a scalable semi-automated eXplainable AI (XAI) method, that uses meta-learning and Shapley values analysis to provide actionable and dataset-aware tuning insights. MetaSHAP operates over a vast benchmark of over 09 millions evaluated machine learning pipelines, allowing it to produce interpretable importance scores and actionable tuning insights that reveal how much each hyperparameter matters, how it interacts with others and in which value ranges its influence is concentrated. For a given algorithm and dataset, MetaSHAP learns a surrogate performance model from historical configurations, computes hyperparameters interactions using SHAP-based analysis, and derives interpretable tuning ranges from the most influential hyperparameters. This allows practitioners not only to prioritize which hyperparameters to tune, but also to understand their directionality and interactions. We empirically validate MetaSHAP on a diverse benchmark of 164 classification datasets and 14 classifiers, demonstrating that it produces reliable importance rankings and competitive performance when used to guide Bayesian optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MetaSHAP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eShapley\u503c\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u534a\u81ea\u52a8XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u7406\u89e3\u5404\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "MetaSHAP\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85900\u4e07\u6761\u5386\u53f2\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528SHAP\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8c03\u4f18\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728164\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c14\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMetaSHAP\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaSHAP\u4e3a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u4f18\u5148\u8c03\u4f18\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that training a generative model exclusively on half-objects, obtained by reflecting one half of the shapes along the x=0 plane, enables the model to learn a rich distribution of partial geometries which, when reflected during generation, yield complete shapes that are both visually plausible and geometrically symmetric. To test this, we construct a new dataset of half-objects from three ShapeNet classes (Airplane, Car, and Chair) and train two generative models.

While MU has been extensively explored in classical deep learning, its behavior within variational quantum circuits (VQCs) and quantum-augmented architectures remains largely unexplored. First, we adapt a broad suite of unlearning methods to quantum settings, including gradient-based, distillation-based, regularization-based and certified techniques. Second, we introduce two new unlearning strategies tailored to hybrid models. Experiments across Iris, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, under both subset removal and full-class deletion, reveal that quantum models can support effective unlearning, but outcomes depend strongly on circuit depth, entanglement structure, and task complexity. Shallow VQCs display high intrinsic stability with minimal memorization, whereas deeper hybrid models exhibit stronger trade-offs between utility, forgetting strength, and alignment with retrain oracle. We find that certain methods, e.g. EU-k, LCA, and Certified Unlearning, consistently provide the best balance across metrics. These findings establish baseline empirical insights into quantum machine unlearning and highlight the need for quantum-aware algorithms and theoretical guarantees, as quantum machine learning systems continue to expand in scale and capability.

It aims to infer a complete 3D volumetric representation of both semantics and geometry from a single image. Existing methods typically focus on end-to-end 2D-to-3D feature lifting and voxel completion. However, they often overlook the interference between high-confidence visible-region perception and low-confidence occluded-region reasoning caused by single-image input, which can lead to feature dilution and error propagation.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce an offline Visible Region Label Extraction (VRLE) strategy that explicitly separates and extracts voxel-level supervision for visible regions from dense 3D ground truth. This strategy purifies the supervisory space for two complementary sub-tasks: visible-region perception and occluded-region reasoning. Building on this idea, we propose the Visible-Occluded Interactive Completion Network (VOIC), a novel dual-decoder framework that explicitly decouples SSC into visible-region semantic perception and occluded-region scene completion. VOIC first constructs a base 3D voxel representation by fusing image features with depth-derived occupancy. The visible decoder focuses on generating high-fidelity geometric and semantic priors, while the occlusion decoder leverages these priors together with cross-modal interaction to perform coherent global scene reasoning.\n  Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that VOIC outperforms existing monocular SSC methods in both geometric completion and semantic segmentation accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVOIC\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c1\u533a\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\u63d0\u53d6\uff08VRLE\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53cc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u76ee3D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\uff08SSC\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c1\u533a\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u533a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u8865\u5168\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76eeSSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53ef\u89c1\u533a\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u906e\u6321\u533a\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u7a00\u91ca\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u7ebf\u53ef\u89c1\u533a\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\u63d0\u53d6\uff08VRLE\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89c1-\u906e\u6321\u4ea4\u4e92\u8865\u5168\u7f51\u7edc\uff08VOIC\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u53ef\u89c1\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u906e\u6321\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u8be5\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728SemanticKITTI\u548cSSCBench-KITTI360\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cVOIC\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u8865\u5168\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76eeSSC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u53ef\u89c1\u533a\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u533a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u7eaf\u51c0\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee3D\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Traditional data-driven methods require extensive labeled fault data, which is often impractical to obtain, while model-based approaches suffer from parameter uncertainties. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-driven zero-shot fault diagnosis framework utilizing fluid-borne noise (FBN) signals. The framework calibrates a high-fidelity DT model using only healthy-state data, generates synthetic fault signals for training deep learning classifiers, and employs a physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a virtual sensor for flow ripple estimation. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) is integrated to visualize the decision-making process of neural networks, revealing that large kernels matching the subsequence length in time-domain inputs and small kernels in time-frequency domain inputs enable higher diagnostic accuracy by focusing on physically meaningful features. Experimental validations demonstrate that training on signals from the calibrated DT model yields diagnostic accuracies exceeding 95\\% on real-world benchmarks, while uncalibrated models result in significantly lower performance, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in data-scarce scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff08DT\uff09\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u4f53\u4f20\u64ad\u566a\u58f0\uff08FBN\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6821\u51c6\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fDT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6545\u969c\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINN\uff09\u548cGrad-CAM\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08>95%\uff09\u8f74\u5411\u67f1\u585e\u6cf5\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\uff08\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6545\u969cFBN\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u5f15\u5165PINN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d41\u91cf\u8109\u52a8\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Grad-CAM\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc795%\uff1b\u672a\u6821\u51c6DT\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bGrad-CAM\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u65f6\u57df\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5927\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u3001\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u7406\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0DT\u9a71\u52a8\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u532e\u4e4f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f74\u5411\u67f1\u585e\u6cf5\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6db2\u538b\u5143\u4ef6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8fd0\u7ef4\u3002"}}

This limitation leads to ``Semantic-Visual Dissonance,'' where accurate facial geometry clashes with the input's unique atmosphere, causing an unnatural ``sticker-like'' effect. We propose **DVI (Disentangled Visual-Identity)**, a zero-shot framework that orthogonally disentangles identity into fine-grained semantic and coarse-grained visual streams. Unlike methods relying solely on semantic vectors, DVI exploits the inherent statistical properties of the VAE latent space, utilizing mean and variance as lightweight descriptors for global visual atmosphere. We introduce a **Parameter-Free Feature Modulation** mechanism that adaptively modulates semantic embeddings with these visual statistics, effectively injecting the reference's ``visual soul'' without training. Furthermore, a **Dynamic Temporal Granularity Scheduler** aligns with the diffusion process, prioritizing visual atmosphere in early denoising stages while refining semantic details later.

However, most existing applications are limited to identifying objects alone, without considering their associated states. The ability to recognize both the state and object simultaneously remains less common. One approach to address this is by treating state and object as a single category during training. However, this approach poses challenges in data collection and training since it requires comprehensive data for all possible combinations. Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) emerges as a viable solution by treating the state and object as distinct categories during training. CZSL facilitates the identification of novel compositions even in the absence of data for every conceivable combination. The current state-of-the-art method, KG-SP, addresses this issue by training distinct classifiers for states and objects, while leveraging a semantic model to evaluate the plausibility of composed compositions. However, KG-SP's accuracy in state and object recognition can be further improved, and it fails to consider the weighting of states and objects during composition. In this study, we propose SASOW, an enhancement of KG-SP that considers the weighting of states and objects while improving composition recognition accuracy. First, we introduce self-attention mechanisms into the classifiers for states and objects, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing both. Additionally, we incorporate the weighting of states and objects during composition to generate more reasonable and accurate compositions. Our validation process involves testing SASOW on three established benchmark datasets. Experimental outcomes affirm when compared against OW-CZSL approach, KG-SP, SASOW showcases improvements of 2.1%, 1.7%, and 0.4% in terms of accuracy for unseen compositions across the MIT-States, UT Zappos, and C-GQA datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSASOW\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86KG-SP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CZSL\uff09\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u72b6\u6001/\u7269\u4f53\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u672a\u89c1\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u7269\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u7ec4\u5408\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff1bCZSL\u867d\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u672a\u89c1\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982KG-SP\uff09\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5408\u7406\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSASOW\uff1a1\uff09\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5206\u522b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIT-States\u3001UT Zappos\u548cC-GQA\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSASOW\u76f8\u6bd4KG-SP\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u7ec4\u5408\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53472.1%\u30011.7%\u548c0.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "SASOW\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u72b6\u6001-\u7269\u4f53\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9CZSL\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, these approaches perform redundant point processing and consequently become computationally expensive, yet still overlook the rich geometric priors inherently provided by raw point clouds. To this end, we introduce ICP-4D, a simple yet effective training-free framework that unifies spatial and temporal reasoning through geometric relations among instance-level point sets. Specifically, we apply the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to directly associate temporally consistent instances by aligning the source and target point sets through the estimated transformation. To stabilize association under noisy instance predictions, we introduce a Sinkhorn-based soft matching. This exploits the underlying instance distribution to obtain accurate point-wise correspondences, resulting in robust geometric alignment. Furthermore, our carefully designed pipeline, which considers three instance types-static, dynamic, and missing-offers computational efficiency and occlusion-aware matching.

We begin with A-MPLang, the fragment without activation functions, and give a characterization of its expressive power in terms of walk-summed features. For bounded activation functions, we show that (under mild conditions) all eventually constant activations yield the same expressive power - numerical and Boolean - and that it subsumes previously established logics for GNNs with eventually constant activation functions but without linear layers. Finally, we prove the first expressive separation between unbounded and bounded activations in the presence of linear layers: MPLang with ReLU is strictly more powerful for numerical queries than MPLang with eventually constant activation functions, e.g., truncated ReLU. This hinges on subtle interactions between linear aggregation and eventually constant non-linearities, and it establishes that GNNs using ReLU are more expressive than those restricted to eventually constant activations and linear layers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86MPLang\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u63cf\u8ff0\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u5728\u6570\u503c\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u6709\u754c/\u65e0\u754c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6709\u754c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u622a\u65adReLU\uff09\u5728\u6570\u503c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNNs\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\u5bf9\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\u5173\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790MPLang\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\uff08A-MPLang\u3001\u5e26\u4e0d\u540c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684MPLang\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408walk-summed\u7279\u5f81\u523b\u753b\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u6bd4\u8f83\u53ca\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6570\u503c\u4e0e\u5e03\u5c14\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "1) A-MPLang\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u53ef\u7531walk-summed\u7279\u5f81\u523b\u753b\uff1b2) \u6240\u6709\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u5e38\u6570\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u8d4b\u4e88MPLang\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6570\u503c\u4e0e\u5e03\u5c14\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5f3a\u4e8e\u6b64\u524d\u76f8\u5173\u903b\u8f91\uff1b3) \u9996\u6b21\u8bc1\u660eReLU\u4f7fMPLang\u5728\u6570\u503c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u4e25\u683c\u5f3a\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u6700\u7ec8\u5e38\u6570\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u622a\u65adReLU\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GNN\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u754c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5728GNN\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927GNN\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Existing methods often lack adaptability to dynamic conditions and fail to optimize decision making in real time. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for enhanced spoilage prediction. This hybrid architecture captures temporal dependencies within sensor data, enabling robust and adaptive decision making. In alignment with interpretable artificial intelligence principles, a rule-based classifier environment is employed to provide transparent ground truth labeling of spoilage levels based on domain-specific thresholds. This structured design allows the agent to operate within clearly defined semantic boundaries, supporting traceable and interpretable decisions. Model behavior is monitored using interpretability-driven metrics, including spoilage accuracy, reward-to-step ratio, loss reduction rate, and exploration decay. These metrics provide both quantitative performance evaluation and insights into learning dynamics. A class-wise spoilage distribution visualization is used to analyze the agents decision profile and policy behavior. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-time hardware data demonstrate that the LSTM and RNN based agent outperforms alternative reinforcement learning approaches in prediction accuracy and decision efficiency while maintaining interpretability.

We introduce CETCAM, a camera-controllable video generation framework that eliminates the need for camera annotations through a consistent and extensible tokenization scheme. CETCAM leverages recent advances in geometry foundation models, such as VGGT, to estimate depth and camera parameters and converts them into unified, geometry-aware tokens. These tokens are seamlessly integrated into a pretrained video diffusion backbone via lightweight context blocks. Trained in two progressive stages, CETCAM first learns robust camera controllability from diverse raw video data and then refines fine-grained visual quality using curated high-fidelity datasets.

Classical Data-Shapley answers in principle, but its O(n!) complexity and point-wise perspective are ill-suited to modern scales. We propose Hierarchical Contrastive Data Valuation (HCDV), a three-stage framework that (i) learns a contrastive, geometry-preserving representation, (ii) organizes the data into a balanced coarse-to-fine hierarchy of clusters, and (iii) assigns Shapley-style payoffs to coalitions via local Monte-Carlo games whose budgets are propagated downward. HCDV collapses the factorial burden to O(T sum_{l} K_{l}) = O(T K_max log n), rewards examples that sharpen decision boundaries, and regularizes outliers through curvature-based smoothness. We prove that HCDV approximately satisfies the four Shapley axioms with surplus loss O(eta log n), enjoys sub-Gaussian coalition deviation tilde O(1/sqrt{T}), and incurs at most k epsilon_infty regret for top-k selection. Experiments on four benchmarks--tabular, vision, streaming, and a 45M-sample CTR task--plus the OpenDataVal suite show that HCDV lifts accuracy by up to +5 pp, slashes valuation time by up to 100x, and directly supports tasks such as augmentation filtering, low-latency streaming updates, and fair marketplace payouts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u503c\uff08HCDV\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002HCDV\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u535a\u5f08\u7684Shapley\u5f0f\u8d4b\u503c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfData-Shapley\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176O(n!)\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u9010\u70b9\u89c6\u89d2\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "HCDV\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(i) \u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1b(ii) \u5c06\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7531\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b(iii) \u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u4e0b\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u4e3a\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u914dShapley\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "result": "HCDV\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4eceO(n!)\u964d\u81f3O(T K_max log n)\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u591a\u8fbe+5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4f30\u503c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a100\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u589e\u5f3a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6d41\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u5e02\u573a\u652f\u4ed8\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "HCDV\u5728\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6ee1\u8db3Shapley\u516c\u7406\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u754c\u3001\u540e\u6094\u754c\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\uff08\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u91cf\u5316\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Distinct from Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed node activations and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) featuring learnable edge activations, SNs utilize shared, learnable splines (monotonic and general) within structured blocks incorporating explicit shift parameters and mixing weights. Our approach directly realizes Sprecher's specific 1965 sum of shifted splines formula in its single-layer variant and extends it to deeper, multi-layer compositions. We further enhance the architecture with optional lateral mixing connections that enable intra-block communication between output dimensions, providing a parameter-efficient alternative to full attention mechanisms. Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints. We demonstrate empirically that composing these blocks into deep networks leads to highly parameter and memory-efficient models, discuss theoretical motivations, and compare SNs with related architectures (MLPs, KANs, and networks with learnable node activations).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Sprecher Networks\uff08SNs\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u7ecf\u5178Kolmogorov-Arnold-Sprecher\u6784\u9020\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u6761\u3001\u663e\u5f0f\u79fb\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4MLP\u548cKAN\uff0cSNs\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff08O(LN + LG) vs O(LN\u00b2)\uff09\u4e0e\u524d\u5411\u4e2d\u95f4\u5185\u5b58\uff08O(N) vs O(N\u00b2)\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6df1\u5ea6\u5806\u53e0\u4e0e\u6a2a\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfMLP\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001KAN\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov-Arnold\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u79fb\u4f4d\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSprecher 1965\u5e74\u5355\u5c42\u79fb\u4f4d\u6837\u6761\u548c\u516c\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5355\u8c03/\u901a\u7528\uff09\u6837\u6761\u3001\u663e\u5f0f\u79fb\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u591a\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u53ef\u9009\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u8fde\u63a5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5757\u5185\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5cf0\u503c\u3002", "result": "SNs\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff08O(LN + LG)\uff09\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\uff08\u524d\u5411\u4e2d\u95f4\u5185\u5b58O(N)\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5ab2\u7f8eMLP\u3001KAN\u53ca\u8282\u70b9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "Sprecher Networks\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u6839\u57fa\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5bbd\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Privacy regulations, however, forbid retaining past data, necessitating rehearsal-free IL (RF-IL). Vision-Language Pre-trained (VLP) models, with their prompt-tunable cross-modal representations, enable efficient adaptation to new spoofing styles and domains. Capitalizing on this strength, we propose \\textbf{SVLP-IL}, a VLP-based RF-IL framework that balances stability and plasticity via \\textit{Multi-Aspect Prompting} (MAP) and \\textit{Selective Elastic Weight Consolidation} (SEWC). MAP isolates domain dependencies, enhances distribution-shift sensitivity, and mitigates forgetting by jointly exploiting universal and domain-specific cues.

We introduce IndoMER, the first multimodal emotion recognition benchmark for Indonesian, comprising 1,944 video segments from 203 speakers with temporally aligned text, audio, and visual annotations across seven emotion categories. The dataset exhibits realistic challenges including cross-modal inconsistency and long-tailed class distributions shaped by Indonesian cultural communication norms. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMER, a multimodal adaptation framework built upon Qwen2.5-Omni that enhances emotion recognition through three auxiliary modality-specific perception tasks: emotion keyword extraction for text, facial expression analysis for video, and prosody analysis for audio. These auxiliary tasks help the model identify emotion-relevant cues in each modality before fusion, reducing reliance on spurious correlations in low-resource settings. Experiments on IndoMER show that OmniMER achieves 0.582 Macro-F1 on sentiment classification and 0.454 on emotion recognition, outperforming the base model by 7.6 and 22.1 absolute points respectively. Cross-lingual evaluation on the Chinese CH-SIMS dataset further demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed framework.

Given a reference image (e.g., one's pet), we expect the generated image to retain precise details attached to the subject's identity. However, current generative evaluation metrics emphasize the overall semantic similarity between the reference and the output, and overlook these fine-grained discriminative details. We introduce Finer-Personalization Rank, an evaluation protocol tailored to identity preservation. Instead of pairwise similarity, Finer-Personalization Rank adopts a ranking view: it treats each generated image as a query against an identity-labeled gallery consisting of visually similar real images. Retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) measure performance, where higher scores indicate that identity-specific details (e.g., a distinctive head spot) are preserved. We assess identity at multiple granularities -- from fine-grained categories (e.g., bird species, car models) to individual instances (e.g., re-identification). Across CUB, Stanford Cars, and animal Re-ID benchmarks, Finer-Personalization Rank more faithfully reflects identity retention than semantic-only metrics and reveals substantial identity drift in several popular personalization methods.

Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility.

Code: https://github.com/sandroandric/Brain-Grounded-Axes-for-Reading-and-Steering-LLM-States", "summary": "Interpretability methods for large language models (LLMs) typically derive directions from textual supervision, which can lack external grounding. We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08\u800c\u975e\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u6765\u89e3\u8bfb\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MEG\u8111\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8111\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u72ec\u7acb\u6210\u5206\uff08ICA\uff09\u8f74\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5c06LLM\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8111\u8f74\u4e0a\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7531\u6b64\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u8111\u6e90\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u5982\u9891\u7387\u8f74\u3001\u529f\u80fd/\u5185\u5bb9\u8f74\uff09\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7406\u5b66 grounding\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee5\u4eba\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e3a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSMN4Lang MEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u8bcd\u7ea7\u76f8\u4f4d\u9501\u5b9a\u503c\uff08PLV\uff09\u8111\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u7528ICA\u63d0\u53d6\u6f5c\u5728\u8f74\uff1b\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u8bcd\u5178\u548cNER\u6807\u7b7e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f74\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5c06LLM\u9690\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u4e0d\u5fae\u8c03LLM\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u8111\u8f74\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\uff08TinyLlama/Qwen2-0.5B/GPT-2\uff09\u3001PPL\u5339\u914d\u63a7\u5236\u3001fMRI\u951a\u5b9a\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4e2d\u5c42\uff08TinyLlama\u7b2c4\u5c42\u9644\u8fd1\uff09\u8bcd\u9891\u76f8\u5173\u8f74\uff0c\u5176log-frequency\u504f\u79fb\u5927\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u63a2\u9488\u4e14\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u529f\u80fd/\u5185\u5bb9\u8f74\uff08Axis 13\uff09\uff1b\u8111\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u7a33\u5065\uff08r=0.64\u20130.95\uff09\uff1bfMRI\u521d\u6b65\u652f\u6301embedding change\u4e0elog frequency\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u3001\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8f74\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0eLLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4ea4\u53c9\u7684\u65b0\u63a5\u53e3\u3002"}}

Preprint under review for journal submission", "summary": "Few-shot action recognition aims to enable models to quickly learn new action categories from limited labeled samples, addressing the challenge of data scarcity in real-world applications. Current research primarily addresses three core challenges: (1) temporal modeling, where models are prone to interference from irrelevant static background information and struggle to capture the essence of dynamic action features; (2) visual similarity, where categories with subtle visual differences are difficult to distinguish; and (3) the modality gap between visual-textual support prototypes and visual-only queries, which complicates alignment within a shared embedding space. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a CLIP-SPM framework, which includes three components: (1) the Hierarchical Synergistic Motion Refinement (HSMR) module, which aligns deep and shallow motion features to improve temporal modeling by reducing static background interference; (2) the Semantic Prototype Modulation (SPM) strategy, which generates query-relevant text prompts to bridge the modality gap and integrates them with visual features, enhancing the discriminability between similar actions; and (3) the Prototype-Anchor Dual Modulation (PADM) method, which refines support prototypes and aligns query features with a global semantic anchor, improving consistency across support and query samples. Comprehensive experiments across standard benchmarks, including Kinetics, SSv2-Full, SSv2-Small, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate that our CLIP-SPM achieves competitive performance under 1-shot, 3-shot, and 5-shot settings. Extensive ablation studies and visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component and its contributions to addressing the core challenges.

In physics, conservation laws of Hamiltonian systems such as symplecticity guarantee long-term stability, and recent work has begun to hard-wire such constraints into learning models at the loss or output level. Here we ask a different question: what would it mean for the representation itself to obey a symplectic conservation law in the sense of Hamiltonian mechanics?\n  We express this symplectic constraint through Legendre duality: the pairing between primal and dual parameters, which becomes the structure that the representation must preserve. We formalize Legendre dynamics as stochastic processes whose trajectories remain on Legendre graphs, so that the evolving primal-dual parameters stay Legendre dual. We show that this class includes linear time-invariant Gaussian process regression and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics.\n  Geometrically, we prove that the maps that preserve all Legendre graphs are exactly symplectomorphisms of cotangent bundles of the form \"cotangent lift of a base diffeomorphism followed by an exact fibre translation\". Dynamically, this characterization leads to the design of a Symplectic Reservoir (SR), a reservoir-computing architecture that is a special case of recurrent neural network and whose recurrent core is generated by Hamiltonian systems that are at most linear in the momentum.\n  Our main theorem shows that every SR update has this normal form and therefore transports Legendre graphs to Legendre graphs, preserving Legendre duality at each time step. Overall, SR implements a geometrically constrained, Legendre-preserving representation map, injecting symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics directly at the representational level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u8f9b\u50a8\u5c42\uff08Symplectic Reservoir, SR\uff09\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u8f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8868\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u7269\u7406\u6216\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff1b\u800c\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u5f8b\uff08\u5982\u8f9b\u6027\uff09\u53ef\u4fdd\u969c\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u8ba9\u8868\u5f81\u672c\u8eab\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u635f\u5931\u6216\u8f93\u51fa\u6ee1\u8db3\u8f9b\u5b88\u6052\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u56fe\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\u4fdd\u6301\u6240\u6709\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u56fe\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u4f59\u5207\u63d0\u5347\u52a0\u7cbe\u786e\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5e73\u79fb\u7684\u8f9b\u540c\u80da\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1SR\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u7531\u81f3\u591a\u5173\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u50a8\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u548cOrnstein-Uhlenbeck\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c5e\u4e8e\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u7ed9\u51faSR\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6bcf\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u52d2\u8ba9\u5fb7\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\uff1bSR\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u663e\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165\u8f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5185\u5316\u4e8e\u8868\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5177\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u7684\uff1bSR\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u4e00\u7c7b\u53d7\u63a7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Deep learning-based watermarking has improved robustness to diffusion-based image editing, but a gap remains when a watermarked image is converted to video by image-to-video (I2V), in which per-frame watermark detection weakens. I2V has quickly advanced from short, jittery clips to multi-second, temporally coherent scenes, and it now serves not only content creation but also world-modeling and simulation workflows, making cross-modal watermark recovery crucial. We present WaTeRFlow, a framework tailored for robustness under I2V. It consists of (i) FUSE (Flow-guided Unified Synthesis Engine), which exposes the encoder-decoder to realistic distortions via instruction-driven edits and a fast video diffusion proxy during training, (ii) optical-flow warping with a Temporal Consistency Loss (TCL) that stabilizes per-frame predictions, and (iii) a semantic preservation loss that maintains the conditioning signal.

We ask a basic question: when is such a dynamical system learnable from observations alone? This paper proposes a research program for understanding learnability in dynamical systems through the lens of next-token prediction. We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u9700\u5904\u7406\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f55\u65f6\u4ec5\u51ed\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u7c7b\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u672a\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u2018\u4e0b\u4e00\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u2019\u4e3a\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u3001\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u70ed\u671f\u540e\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u90fd\u6210\u7acb\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u975e\u6070\u5f53\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u523b\u753b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\uff09\u4e0e\u6240\u9700\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u2018\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u5728\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u6d4b\u540e\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u5e94\u7531\u5176\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u51fa\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u53d7\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often require manually specified intermediate waypoints and place all optimization objectives on a single network, which increases complexity, reduces flexibility, and leads to errors such as unsynchronized human and object motion or penetration. To address these issues, we propose Decoupled Generative Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Synthesis (DecHOI), which separates path planning and action synthesis. A trajectory generator first produces human and object trajectories without prescribed waypoints, and an action generator conditions on these paths to synthesize detailed motions.

We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.\n  To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space.\n  On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers. On the SNLI natural language inference task, a Grassmann-Plucker head on top of DistilBERT slightly outperforms a Transformer head, with best validation and test accuracies of 0.8550 and 0.8538 compared to 0.8545 and 0.8511.

While neural operator methods such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Koopman-inspired extensions achieve good short-term accuracy, their long-term stability is often limited by unconstrained latent representations and cumulative rollout errors. In this work, we introduce an inverse scattering inspired Fourier Neural Operator(IS-FNO), motivated by the reversibility and spectral evolution structure underlying the classical inverse scattering transform. The proposed architecture enforces a near-reversible pairing between lifting and projection maps through an explicitly invertible neural transformation, and models latent temporal evolution using exponential Fourier layers that naturally encode linear and nonlinear spectral dynamics. We systematically evaluate IS-FNO against baseline FNO and Koopman-based models on a range of benchmark PDEs, including the Michelson-Sivashinsky and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (in one and two dimensions), as well as the integrable Korteweg-de Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The results demonstrate that IS-FNO achieves lower short-term errors and substantially improved long-horizon stability in non-stiff regimes. For integrable systems, reduced IS-FNO variants that embed analytical scattering structure retain competitive long-term accuracy despite limited model capacity. Overall, this work shows that incorporating physical structure -- particularly reversibility and spectral evolution -- into neural operator design significantly enhances robustness and long-term predictive fidelity for nonlinear PDE dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u9006\u6563\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08IS-FNO\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u6307\u6570\u578b\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6df7\u6c8c\u3001\u521a\u6027\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08\u5982FNO\u548cKoopman\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u5c55\u5f00\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIS-FNO\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u53ef\u9006\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u6295\u5f71\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u9006\u914d\u5bf9\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u6307\u6570\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u7f16\u7801\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8c31\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b3\uff09\u5bf9\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u5d4c\u5165\u89e3\u6790\u6563\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728Michelson-Sivashinsky\u3001Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\u3001KdV\u548cKP\u7b49\u591a\u7c7bPDE\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cIS-FNO\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u77ed\u671f\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u975e\u521a\u6027\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u5bf9\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u7248\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u957f\u671f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u2014\u2014\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u548c\u8c31\u6f14\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u2014\u2014\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027PDE\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Unlike other kernel methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), KLRs are generally not sparse. Previous attempts to deal with sparsity in KLR include a heuristic method referred to as the Import Vector Machine (IVM) and ad hoc regularizations such as the $\\ell_{1/2}$-based one. Achieving a good trade-off between prediction accuracy and sparsity is still a challenging issue with a potential significant impact from the application point of view. In this work, we revisit binary KLR and propose an extension of the training formulation proposed by Keerthi et al., which is able to induce sparsity in the trained model, while maintaining good testing accuracy. To efficiently solve the dual of this formulation, we devise a decomposition algorithm of Sequential Minimal Optimization type which exploits second-order information, and for which we establish global convergence. Numerical experiments conducted on 12 datasets from the literature show that the proposed binary KLR approach achieves a competitive trade-off between accuracy and sparsity with respect to IVM, $\\ell_{1/2}$-based regularization for KLR, and SVM while retaining the advantages of providing informative estimates of the class membership probabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u6838\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\uff08KLR\uff09\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfKLR\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684SMO\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eIVM\u3001\u2113\u2081/\u2082\u6b63\u5219\u5316KLR\u548cSVM\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6838\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\uff08KLR\uff09\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982IVM\u3001\u2113\u2081/\u2082\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Keerthi\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7bKLR\u8bad\u7ec3\u516c\u5f0f\u4ee5\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6700\u5c0f\u4f18\u5316\uff08SMO\uff09\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9\u5076\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u4e8eIVM\u3001\u2113\u2081/\u2082\u6b63\u5219\u5316KLR\u548cSVM\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559KLR\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c7b\u6210\u5458\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86KLR\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6982\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This task is commonly formulated as open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. Although recent methods demonstrate strong performance, they depend heavily on SAM and CLIP to generate and classify 3D instance masks from images accompanying the point cloud, leading to substantial computational overhead and slow processing that limit their deployment in real-world settings. Open-YOLO 3D alleviates this issue by using a real-time 2D detector to classify class-agnostic masks produced directly from the point cloud by a pretrained 3D segmenter, eliminating the need for SAM and CLIP and significantly reducing inference time. However, Open-YOLO 3D often fails to generalize to object categories that appear infrequently in the 3D training data. In this paper, we propose a method that generates 3D instance masks for novel objects from RGB images guided by a 2D open-vocabulary detector. Our approach inherits the 2D detector's ability to recognize novel objects while maintaining efficient classification, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of rare instances from open-ended text queries.

While models with embedded confidence metrics have been proposed, such approaches cannot be applied to already existing models without retraining, limiting their broad application. On the other hand, post-hoc methods, which evaluate pre-trained models, focus on solving problems related to improving the confidence in the model's predictions, and detecting Out-Of-Distribution or Adversarial Attacks samples as independent applications. To tackle the limited applicability of already existing methods, we introduce Multi-Layer Analysis for Confidence Scoring (MACS), a unified post-hoc framework that analyzes intermediate activations to produce classification-maps. From the classification-maps, we derive a score applicable for confidence estimation, detecting distributional shifts and adversarial attacks, unifying the three problems in a common framework, and achieving performances that surpass the state-of-the-art approaches in our experiments with the VGG16 and ViTb16 models with a fraction of their computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMACS\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u540e\u7f6e\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5206\u7c7b\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e2d\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5df2\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u89e3\u51b3\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMulti-Layer Analysis for Confidence Scoring (MACS)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u540e\u7f6e\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5206\u7c7b\u56fe\u5e76\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7edf\u4e00\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728VGG16\u548cViTb16\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMACS\u5728\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "MACS\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u540e\u7f6e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite their importance, medical AI leaderboards exhibit three persistent limitations: (1) score gaps are rarely tested for statistical significance, so rank stability is unknown; (2) single averaged metrics are applied to every organ, hiding clinically important boundary errors; (3) performance across intersecting demographics is seldom reported, masking fairness and equity gaps. We introduce RankInsight, an open-source toolkit that seeks to address these limitations. RankInsight (1) computes pair-wise significance maps that show the nnU-Net family outperforms Vision-Language and MONAI submissions with high statistical certainty; (2) recomputes leaderboards with organ-appropriate metrics, reversing the order of the top four models when Dice is replaced by NSD for tubular structures; and (3) audits intersectional fairness, revealing that more than half of the MONAI-based entries have the largest gender-race discrepancy on our proprietary Johns Hopkins Hospital dataset. The RankInsight toolkit is publicly released and can be directly applied to past, ongoing, and future challenges.

Conventional deep learning IDS are often too large and computationally intensive for edge deployment. We propose a lightweight IDS that combines SHAP-guided feature pruning with knowledge-distilled Kronecker networks. A high-capacity teacher model identifies the most relevant features through SHAP explanations, and a compressed student leverages Kronecker-structured layers to minimize parameters while preserving discriminative inputs. Knowledge distillation transfers softened decision boundaries from teacher to student, improving generalization under compression. Experiments on the TON\\_IoT dataset show that the student is nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the teacher yet sustains macro-F1 above 0.986 with millisecond-level inference latency.

However, prolonged scan times remain a major barrier to patient throughput and comfort. Existing accelerated MRI techniques often struggle with two key challenges: (1) failure to effectively utilize inherent K-space prior information, leading to persistent aliasing artifacts from zero-filled inputs; and (2) contamination of target reconstruction quality by irrelevant information when employing multi-contrast fusion strategies. To overcome these challenges, we present MambaMDN, a dual-domain framework for multi-contrast MRI reconstruction. Our approach first employs fully-sampled reference K-space data to complete the undersampled target data, generating structurally aligned but modality-mixed inputs.

Most research to-date builds on domain-knowledge-based corruption risk indicators of individual contract-level features and some also analyzes contracting network patterns. A critical barrier for supervised machine learning is the absence of confirmed non-corrupt, negative, examples, which makes conventional machine learning inappropriate for this task. Using publicly available data on federally funded procurement in Mexico and company sanction records, this study implements positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms that integrate domain-knowledge-based red flags with network-derived features to identify likely corrupt and fraudulent contracts. The best-performing PU model on average captures 32 percent more known positives and performs on average 2.3 times better than random guessing, substantially outperforming approaches based solely on traditional red flags. The analysis of the Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that network-derived features, particularly those associated with contracts in the network core or suppliers with high eigenvector centrality, are the most important. Traditional red flags further enhance model performance in line with expectations, albeit mainly for contracts awarded through competitive tenders. This methodology can support law enforcement in Mexico, and it can be adapted to other national contexts too.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ea2\u6807\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6b63-\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\uff08PU\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u8054\u90a6\u653f\u5e9c\u91c7\u8d2d\u4e2d\u7684\u8150\u8d25\u548c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u5408\u540c\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u975e\u8150\u8d25\u6837\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u653f\u5e9c\u91c7\u8d2d\u4e2d\u8150\u8d25\u548c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u7f3a\u4e4f\u786e\u8ba4\u7684\u975e\u8150\u8d25\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6b63-\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\uff08PU\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8150\u8d25\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4ece\u91c7\u8d2d\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6838\u5fc3\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u8054\u90a6\u91c7\u8d2d\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u5236\u88c1\u8bb0\u5f55\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18PU\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u731c\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad82.3\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa32%\u5df2\u77e5\u8150\u8d25\u5408\u540c\uff1bSHAP\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7f51\u7edc\u6838\u5fc3\u5408\u540c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\uff09\u6700\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea2\u6807\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u62db\u6807\u5408\u540c\u4e2d\u8d77\u8f85\u52a9\u589e\u5f3a\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5PU\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u6267\u6cd5\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5411\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u5bb6\u573a\u666f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS) methods (\\textit{e.g.}, GaussianImage) offer promising alternatives through efficient primitive-based rendering. However, these methods require excessive Gaussian primitives to maintain high visual fidelity. To exploit the potential of GS-based approaches, we present GaussianImage++, which utilizes limited Gaussian primitives to achieve impressive representation and compression performance. Firstly, we introduce a distortion-driven densification mechanism. It progressively allocates Gaussian primitives according to signal intensity. Secondly, we employ context-aware Gaussian filters for each primitive, which assist in the densification to optimize Gaussian primitives based on varying image content. Thirdly, we integrate attribute-separated learnable scalar quantizers and quantization-aware training, enabling efficient compression of primitive attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

The vertical directions of camera views can be easily obtained using inertial measurement units (IMUs) which have been widely used in autonomous vehicles, mobile phones, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Given the known vertical directions, our lgorithms only need to solve for two rotation angles and two translation vectors. In this paper, a linear closed-form solution has been described, requiring only four point correspondences in three views. We also propose a minimal solution with three point correspondences using the latest Gr\u00f6bner basis solver. Since the proposed methods require fewer point correspondences, they can be efficiently applied within the RANSAC framework for outliers removal and pose estimation in visual odometry.

To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DK-STN\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684MJO\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8eECMWF\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\uff08NWP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5b63\u8282\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ANN\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230ECMWF 28\u5929\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f51\u7edc\uff08STN\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "DK-STN\u5728ERA5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee57\u5929\u8f93\u5165\u53ef1\u20132\u79d2\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u676528\u5929MJO\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec52\u20133\u5929\uff0c\u4e14\u8de8\u5b63\u8282\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5ab2\u7f8eECMWF\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eECMWF\u3002", "conclusion": "DK-STN\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408NWP\u4e0eANN\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ANN\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684MJO\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c14\u5019\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the underlying mechanisms that hinder MLLMs from serving as effective retrievers. With the help of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), we decompose MLLM output representations into interpretable semantic concepts to probe their intrinsic behavior. Our analysis reveals that the representation space of MLLMs is overwhelmingly dominated by textual semantics; the visual information essential for multimodal retrieval only constitutes a small portion. This imbalance is compounded by the heavy focus of MLLMs on bridging image-text modalities, which facilitates generation but homogenizes embeddings and finally diminishes the discriminative power required for multimodal retrieval. We further discover that the specific feature components that contribute most to the similarity computations for MLLMs are in fact distractors that actively degrade retrieval performance. Overall, our work provides the first in-depth interpretability analysis of MLLM representations in the context of multimodal retrieval and offers possible directions for enhancing the multimodal retrieval capabilities of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u504f\u5411\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5360\u6bd4\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u5224\u522b\u529b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e72\u6270\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347MLLM\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MLLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u5185\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u4f55\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u5c06MLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u56fe\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u6210\u5206\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0MLLM\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u5411\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7a00\u758f\uff1b\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u867d\u5229\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5374\u5bfc\u81f4\u5d4c\u5165\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u3001\u5224\u522b\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4e14\u4e3b\u5bfc\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u4e3a\u5e72\u6270\u9879\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MLLMs\u5f53\u524d\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b\u9700\u91cd\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u5224\u522b\u6027\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing CI tests often rely on restrictive structural conditions, limiting their validity on real-world data. Kernel methods using the partial covariance operator offer a more principled approach but suffer from limited adaptivity, slow convergence, and poor scalability. In this work, we explore whether representation learning can help address these limitations. Specifically, we focus on representations derived from the singular value decomposition of the partial covariance operator and use them to construct a simple test statistic, reminiscent of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC).

While recent approaches leverage historical temporal fusion to improve performance, we identify a critical safety flaw in this paradigm: it is inherently ``spatially backward-looking.\" These methods predominantly enhance map reconstruction in traversed areas, offering minimal improvement for the unseen road ahead. Crucially, our analysis of downstream planning tasks reveals a severe asymmetry: while rearward perception errors are often tolerable, inaccuracies in the forward region directly precipitate hazardous driving maneuvers. To bridge this safety gap, we propose AMap, a novel framework for Ahead-aware online HD Mapping. We pioneer a ``distill-from-future\" paradigm, where a teacher model with privileged access to future temporal contexts guides a lightweight student model restricted to the current frame. This process implicitly compresses prospective knowledge into the student model, endowing it with ``look-ahead\" capabilities at zero inference-time cost. Technically, we introduce a Multi-Level BEV Distillation strategy with spatial masking and an Asymmetric Query Adaptation module to effectively transfer future-aware representations to the student's static queries. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that AMap significantly enhances current-frame perception. Most notably, it outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models in critical forward regions while maintaining the efficiency of single current frame inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAMap\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u2018distill-from-future\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5177\u5907\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u5e27\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u524d\u65b9\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9ad8\u6e05\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u65f6\u5e8f\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5728\u7ebfHD\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5411\u540e\u770b\u2019\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u5bf9\u5df2\u884c\u9a76\u533a\u57df\u6539\u5584\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u524d\u65b9\u672a\u89c1\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u524d\u65b9\u611f\u77e5\u8bef\u5dee\u6bd4\u540e\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u5371\u9669\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMap\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u4e3a\u2018distill-from-future\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u5e27\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7BEV\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a9\u7801\uff09\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u67e5\u8be2\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u9690\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9759\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u548cArgoverse 2\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cAMap\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u5e27\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5173\u952e\u524d\u65b9\u533a\u57df\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "AMap\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5728\u7ebfHD\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u524d\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5373\u53ef\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u2018\u524d\u77bb\u80fd\u529b\u2019\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing methods are confined to isolated tasks, limiting flexibility for free-form and omni-objective generation. To address this, we propose OmniMoGen, a unified framework that enables versatile motion generation through interleaved text-motion instructions. Built upon a concise RVQ-VAE and transformer architecture, OmniMoGen supports end-to-end instruction-driven motion generation. We construct X2Mo, a large-scale dataset of over 137K interleaved text-motion instructions, and introduce AnyContext, a benchmark for evaluating interleaved motion generation.

The advancement of pervasive computing and egocentric vision techniques offers the potential to design systems that can automatically detect such obstacles in real time, thereby enhancing pedestrian safety.

However, learning-based scheduling on unrelated parallel machines remains particularly difficult to design. Not only do the numbers of jobs and machines vary, but each job-machine pair has a unique processing time, dynamically altering feature dimensions. We propose a novel approach with a neural network tailored for offline deterministic scheduling of arbitrary sizes on unrelated machines. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function that includes the makespan and the weighted tardiness of jobs and machines. Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average.

However, most existing methods still rely on replaying data from previous stages to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which compromises privacy and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where data transfer across sites is often restricted. In this work, we propose InvCoSS, an inversion-driven continual self-supervised learning framework for medical multi-modal image pre-training. Specifically, after training on a previous task, InvCoSS inverts the pre-trained self-supervised model to generate synthetic images that approximate the original training distribution. These synthetic images are then combined with data from the new task for joint optimization, which effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while strictly adhering to the constraint of no access to previous real data. Furthermore, to improve the fidelity of synthetic images, we introduce a novel InvUNet with a multi-scale fusion architecture to restore both high- and low-frequency components of the inverted images. To enhance diversity and prevent mode collapse, we design a repulsive representation-learning mechanism that encourages a diverse feature space for synthetic images without class guidance.

Traditional machine learning approaches often treat solvent identity as a discrete categorical variable, which prevents systematic interpolation and extrapolation across the solvent space. This work introduces the \\textbf{Catechol Benchmark}, a high-throughput transient flow chemistry dataset comprising 1,227 experimental yield measurements for the rearrangement of allyl-substituted catechol in 24 pure solvents and their binary mixtures, parameterized by continuous volume fractions ($\\% B$). We evaluate various architectures under rigorous leave-one-solvent-out and leave-one-mixture-out protocols to test generalization to unseen chemical environments.\n  Our results demonstrate that classical tabular methods (e.g., Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees) and large language model embeddings (e.g., Qwen-7B) struggle with quantitative precision, yielding Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of 0.099 and 0.129, respectively. In contrast, we propose a hybrid GNN-based architecture that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP) and learned mixture-aware solvent encodings. This approach achieves an \\textbf{MSE of 0.0039} ($\\pm$ 0.0003), representing a 60\\% error reduction over competitive baselines and a $>25\\times$ improvement over tabular ensembles. Ablation studies confirm that explicit molecular graph message-passing and continuous mixture encoding are essential for robust generalization.

However, high inter-subject variability and complex folding pattern of human hippocampus hinder consistent cross-subject and longitudinal analysis. Most existing approaches rely on subject-specific modelling and lack a stable intrinsic coordinate system to accommodate anatomical variability, which limits their ability to establish reliable inter- and intra-individual correspondence. To address this, we propose HippMetric, a skeletal representation (s-rep)-based framework for hippocampal substructural morphometry and point-wise correspondence across individuals and scans. HippMetric builds on the Axis-Referenced Morphometric Model (ARMM) and employs a deformable skeletal coordinate system aligned with hippocampal anatomy and function, providing a biologically grounded reference for correspondence. Our framework comprises two core modules: a skeletal-based coordinate system that respects the hippocampus' conserved longitudinal lamellar architecture, in which functional units (lamellae) are stacked perpendicular to the long-axis, enabling anatomically consistent localization across subjects and time; and individualized s-reps generated through surface reconstruction, deformation, and geometrically constrained spoke refinement, enforcing boundary adherence, orthogonality and non-intersection to produce mathematically valid skeletal geometry.

This is a weak supervision setting for ordinal regression compared to the full information setting, where the learner can access the labels. We propose an online algorithm for ordinal regression using directional feedback. The proposed algorithm uses an exploration-exploitation scheme to learn from directional feedback efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce its kernel-based variant to learn non-linear ordinal regression models in an online setting. We use a truncation trick to make the kernel implementation more memory efficient. The proposed algorithm maintains the ordering of the thresholds in the expected sense.

We present CARE (Contrastive Anchored REflection), a failure-centric post-training framework for multimodal reasoning that turns errors into supervision. CARE combines: (i) an anchored-contrastive objective that forms a compact subgroup around the best rollout and a set of semantically proximate hard negatives, performs within-subgroup z-score normalization with negative-only scaling, and includes an all-negative rescue to prevent zero-signal batches; and (ii) Reflection-Guided Resampling (RGR), a one-shot structured self-repair that rewrites a representative failure and re-scores it with the same verifier, converting near-misses into usable positives without any test-time reflection. CARE improves accuracy and training smoothness while explicitly increasing the share of learning signal that comes from failures.

This study proposes a three stage pipeline that transforms street view imagery (SVI) into structured representations for predicting six perceptual indicators. In the first stage, each image is parsed using an open-set Panoptic Scene Graph model (OpenPSG) to extract object predicate object triplets. In the second stage, compact scene-level embeddings are learned through a heterogeneous graph autoencoder (GraphMAE). In the third stage, a neural network predicts perception scores from these embeddings. We evaluate the proposed approach against image-only baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, and cross-city generalization. Results indicate that (i) our approach improves perception prediction accuracy by an average of 26% over baseline models, and (ii) maintains strong generalization performance in cross-city prediction tasks. Additionally, the structured representation clarifies which relational patterns contribute to lower perception scores in urban scenes, such as graffiti on wall and car parked on sidewalk. Overall, this study demonstrates that graph-based structure provides expressive, generalizable, and interpretable signals for modelling urban perception, advancing human-centric and context-aware urban analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u5168\u666f\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u5e73\u5747+26%\uff09\u4e0e\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8857\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u50cf\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u7269\u4f53\u5171\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5851\u9020\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u7528OpenPSG\u4ece\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7269\u4f53-\u8c13\u8bcd-\u7269\u4f53\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668GraphMAE\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b3\uff09\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u516d\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534726%\uff0c\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff1b\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u2018\u6d82\u9e26\u5728\u5899\u4e0a\u2019\u2018\u6c7d\u8f66\u505c\u5728\u4eba\u884c\u9053\u4e0a\u2019\u7b49\u62c9\u4f4e\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We find that even state-of-the-art models satisfy fewer than 72 percent of the goals and routinely miss localized edits, confirming the brittleness of current pipelines.

We further fine-tune the planner with Group Relative Policy Optimization, yielding shorter edit trajectories (3.1 versus 4.2 steps) and stronger alignment.

Neural operator (NO) surrogates offer fast inference across parametric and functional inputs; however, most autoregressive NO frameworks remain vulnerable to compounding errors, and ensemble-averaged metrics provide limited guarantees for individual inference trajectories. In practice, error accumulation can become unacceptable beyond the training horizon, and existing methods lack mechanisms for online monitoring or correction. To address this gap, we propose ANCHOR (Adaptive Numerical Correction for High-fidelity Operator Rollouts), an online, instance-aware hybrid inference framework for stable long-horizon prediction of nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs. ANCHOR treats a pretrained NO as the primary inference engine and adaptively couples it with a classical numerical solver using a physics-informed, residual-based error estimator. Inspired by adaptive time-stepping in numerical analysis, ANCHOR monitors an exponential moving average (EMA) of the normalized PDE residual to detect accumulating error and trigger corrective solver interventions without requiring access to ground-truth solutions. We show that the EMA-based estimator correlates strongly with the true relative L2 error, enabling data-free, instance-aware error control during inference. Evaluations on four canonical PDEs: 1D and 2D Burgers', 2D Allen-Cahn, and 3D heat conduction, demonstrate that ANCHOR reliably bounds long-horizon error growth, stabilizes extrapolative rollouts, and significantly improves robustness over standalone neural operators, while remaining substantially more efficient than high-fidelity numerical solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "ANCHOR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bef\u5dee\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u53d8PDE\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u7ebf\u8bef\u5dee\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u540e\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faANCHOR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ee5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u4e3a\u4e3b\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316PDE\u6b8b\u5dee\u6307\u6570\u6ed1\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\uff08EMA\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u89e6\u53d1\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u57281D/2D Burgers'\u30012D Allen-Cahn\u548c3D\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cANCHOR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u8bef\u5dee\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5916\u63a8\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "ANCHOR\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce 3SGen, a task-aware unified framework that performs all three conditioning modes within a single model. 3SGen employs an MLLM equipped with learnable semantic queries to align text-image semantics, complemented by a VAE branch that preserves fine-grained visual details. At its core, an Adaptive Task-specific Memory (ATM) module dynamically disentangles, stores, and retrieves condition-specific priors, such as identity for subjects, textures for styles, and spatial layouts for structures, via a lightweight gating mechanism along with several scalable memory items. This design mitigates inter-task interference and naturally scales to compositional inputs. In addition, we propose 3SGen-Bench, a unified image-driven generation benchmark with standardized metrics for evaluating cross-task fidelity and controllability.

Evaluating Gait Biometric Fidelity in Generative AI Human Animation", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative AI (GenAI) models have revolutionized animation, enabling the synthesis of humans and motion patterns with remarkable visual fidelity. However, generating truly realistic human animation remains a formidable challenge, where even minor inconsistencies can make a subject appear unnatural. This limitation is particularly critical when AI-generated videos are evaluated for behavioral biometrics, where subtle motion cues that define identity are easily lost or distorted. The present study investigates whether state-of-the-art GenAI human animation models can preserve the subtle spatio-temporal details needed for person identification through gait biometrics. Specifically, we evaluate four different GenAI models across two primary evaluation tasks to assess their ability to i) restore gait patterns from reference videos under varying conditions of complexity, and ii) transfer these gait patterns to different visual identities. Our results show that while visual quality is mostly high, biometric fidelity remains low in tasks focusing on identification, suggesting that current GenAI models struggle to disentangle identity from motion. Furthermore, through an identity transfer task, we expose a fundamental flaw in appearance-based gait recognition: when texture is disentangled from motion, identification collapses, proving current GenAI models rely on visual attributes rather than temporal dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff08GenAI\uff09\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u753b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b65\u6001\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u867d\u7136\u5728\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u5982\u6b65\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41GenAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1ai) \u4ece\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u6b65\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff09\uff1bii) \u5c06\u6b65\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u666e\u904d\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff1b\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\uff1a\u5f53\u7eb9\u7406\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89e3\u8026\u540e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u89c2\u800c\u975e\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dGenAI\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u672a\u771f\u6b63\u5efa\u6a21\u6b65\u6001\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5176\u6b65\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u89c2\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u672c\u8d28\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

A core challenge is estimating the wearer's full-body motion from first-person videos, which is crucial for understanding human behavior. However, this task is difficult since most body parts are invisible from the egocentric view. Prior approaches mainly rely on head trajectories, leading to ambiguity, or assume continuously tracked hands, which is unrealistic for lightweight egocentric devices. In this work, we present HaMoS, the first hand-aware, sequence-level diffusion framework that directly conditions on both head trajectory and intermittently visible hand cues caused by field-of-view limitations and occlusions, as in real-world egocentric devices. To overcome the lack of datasets pairing diverse camera views with human motion, we introduce a novel augmentation method that models such real-world conditions. We also demonstrate that sequence-level contexts such as body shape and field-of-view are crucial for accurate motion reconstruction, and thus employ local attention to infer long sequences efficiently. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal smoothness, demonstrating a practical step toward reliable in-the-wild egocentric 3D motion understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HaMoS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u624b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a7f\u6234\u8005\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5934\u90e8\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u95f4\u6b47\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a7f\u6234\u8005\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u5728\u81ea\u62cd\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\uff1b\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5934\u90e8\u8f68\u8ff9\u6216\u5047\u8bbe\u624b\u90e8\u6301\u7eed\u88ab\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHaMoS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ee5\u5934\u90e8\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u95f4\u6b47\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u91ce\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u5982\u8eab\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u89c6\u573a\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "HaMoS\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u53ef\u9760\u91ce\u5916\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f03D\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Existing methods often suffer from insufficient concept mixing, lack of rigorous evaluation, and suboptimal outputs-manifesting as conceptual imbalance, superficial combinations, or mere juxtapositions. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Mixing Learning (RMLer), a framework that formulates cross-category concept fusion as a reinforcement learning problem: mixed features serve as states, mixing strategies as actions, and visual outcomes as rewards. Specifically, we design an MLP-policy network to predict dynamic coefficients for blending cross-category text embeddings. We further introduce visual rewards based on (1) semantic similarity and (2) compositional balance between the fused object and its constituent concepts, optimizing the policy via proximal policy optimization. At inference, a selection strategy leverages these rewards to curate the highest-quality fused objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate RMLer's superiority in synthesizing coherent, high-fidelity objects from diverse categories, outperforming existing methods.

To address this, we developed Think2Seg-RS, a decoupled framework that trains an LVLM prompter to control a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) via structured geometric prompts. Through a mask-only reinforcement learning objective, the LVLM learns to translate abstract semantic reasoning into spatially grounded actions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the EarthReason dataset. Remarkably, the learned prompting policy generalizes zero-shot to multiple referring segmentation benchmarks, exposing a distinct divide between semantic-level and instance-level grounding. We further found that compact segmenters outperform larger ones under semantic-level supervision, and that negative prompts are ineffective in heterogeneous aerial backgrounds. Together, these findings establish semantic-level reasoning segmentation as a new paradigm for geospatial understanding, opening the way toward unified, interpretable LVLM-driven Earth observation.

During training, the input of a prediction network at one training timestep is the corresponding ground-truth noisy data that is an interpolation of the noise and the data, and during testing, the input is the generated noisy data. We present a novel training approach, named MixFlow, for improving the performance. Our approach is motivated by the Slow Flow phenomenon: the ground-truth interpolation that is the nearest to the generated noisy data at a given sampling timestep is observed to correspond to a higher-noise timestep (termed slowed timestep), i.e., the corresponding ground-truth timestep is slower than the sampling timestep. MixFlow leverages the interpolations at the slowed timesteps, named slowed interpolation mixture, for post-training the prediction network for each training timestep. Experiments over class-conditional image generation (including SiT, REPA, and RAE) and text-to-image generation validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach MixFlow over the RAE models achieve strong generation results on ImageNet: 1.43 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 256 x 256, and 1.55 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 512 x 512.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMixFlow\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528'\u6162\u6d41\u73b0\u8c61'\uff08Slow Flow phenomenon\uff09\u7f13\u89e3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5373\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5373\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMixFlow\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e'\u6162\u6d41\u73b0\u8c61'\uff0c\u5373\u751f\u6210\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u63d2\u503c\u5bf9\u5e94\u66f4\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u51cf\u6162\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51cf\u6162\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e0a\u7684\u63d2\u503c\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u51cf\u6162\u63d2\u503c\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff08SiT\u3001REPA\u3001RAE\uff09\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1bRAE\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408MixFlow\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\uff1a256\u00d7256\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0bFID\u4e3a1.43\uff08\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u548c1.10\uff08\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\uff0c512\u00d7512\u4e0bFID\u4e3a1.55\uff08\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u548c1.10\uff08\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MixFlow\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

While neural implicit functions have previously been applied to this task, their application to mapping anatomical consistency across subjects has been limited. In this work, we introduce Neural Implicit Heart Coordinates (NIHCs), a standardized implicit coordinate system, based on universal ventricular coordinates, that provides a common anatomical reference frame for the human heart. Our method predicts NIHCs directly from a limited number of 2D segmentations (sparse acquisition) and subsequently decodes them into dense 3D segmentations and high-resolution meshes at arbitrary output resolution. Trained on a large dataset of 5,000 cardiac meshes, the model achieves high reconstruction accuracy on clinical contours, with mean Euclidean surface errors of 2.51$\\pm$0.33 mm in a diseased cohort (n=4549) and 2.3$\\pm$0.36 mm in a healthy cohort (n=5576). The NIHC representation enables anatomically coherent reconstruction even under severe slice sparsity and segmentation noise, faithfully recovering complex structures such as the valve planes. Compared with traditional pipelines, inference time is reduced from over 60 s to 5-15 s. These results demonstrate that NIHCs constitute a robust and efficient anatomical representation for patient-specific 3D cardiac reconstruction from minimal input data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u5fc3\u810f\u5750\u6807\uff08NIHCs\uff09\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u9690\u5f0f\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u4e34\u5e8a2D\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u91cd\u5efa\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u60273D\u5fc3\u810f\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u4e34\u5e8a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u5fc3\u810f\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4ecd\u662f\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u9762\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5fc3\u5ba4\u5750\u6807\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u5fc3\u810f\u5750\u6807\uff08NIHCs\uff09\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf2D\u5206\u5272\u9884\u6d4bNIHCs\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5bc6\u96c63D\u5206\u5272\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u57285000\u4f8b\u5fc3\u810f\u7f51\u683c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u75be\u75c5\u7ec4\uff08n=4549\uff09\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u7ec4\uff08n=5576\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u5e73\u5747\u6b27\u6c0f\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a2.51\u00b10.33 mm\u548c2.3\u00b10.36 mm\uff1b\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u5207\u7247\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5206\u5272\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u74e3\u819c\u5e73\u9762\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u753160\u79d2\u4ee5\u4e0a\u964d\u81f35\u201315\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "NIHCs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ec5\u9700\u6781\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u60273D\u5fc3\u810f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

For this to be possible, annotated video data of table tennis is needed. We extend the public OpenTTGames dataset with highly detailed, frame-accurate shot type annotations (forehand, backhand with subtypes), player posture labels (body lean and leg stance), and rally outcome tags at point end. OpenTTGames is a set of recordings from the side of the table with official labels for bounces, when the ball is above the net, or hitting the net. The dataset already contains ball coordinates near events, which are either \"bounce\", \"net\", or \"empty_event\" in the original OpenTTGames dataset, and semantic masks (humans, table, scoreboard). Our extension adds the types of stroke to the events and a per-player taxonomy so models can move beyond event spotting toward tactical understanding (e.g., whether a stroke is likely to win the point or set up an advantage).

However, the scale and heterogeneity of WSIs generate highly redundant and dispersed information, making it difficult to identify and integrate discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches, which restricts their performance on large and heterogeneous WSIs. To address this issue, we propose DeltaMIL, a novel MIL framework that explicitly selects semantically relevant regions and integrates the discriminative information from WSIs. Our method leverages the gated delta rule to efficiently filter and integrate information through a block combining forgetting and memory mechanisms. The delta mechanism dynamically updates the memory by removing old values and inserting new ones according to their correlation with the current patch. The gating mechanism further enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Additionally, DeltaMIL integrates a complementary local pattern mixing mechanism to retain fine-grained pathological locality. Our design enhances the extraction of meaningful cues and suppresses redundant or noisy information, which improves the model's robustness and discriminative power. Experiments demonstrate that DeltaMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for survival prediction, DeltaMIL improves performance by 3.69\\% using ResNet-50 features and 2.36\\% using UNI features. For slide-level classification, it increases accuracy by 3.09\\% with ResNet-50 features and 3.75\\% with UNI features. These results demonstrate the strong and consistent performance of DeltaMIL across diverse WSI tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeltaMIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u589e\u91cf\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7b5b\u9009\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u5168\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff08WSI\uff09\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff08WSIs\uff09\u5177\u6709\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5927\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MIL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5254\u9664\u65e0\u5173\u7ebf\u7d22\u6216\u805a\u5408\u5173\u952e\u8865\u4e01\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeltaMIL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u95e8\u63a7\u589e\u91cf\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u5185\u5b58\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u8865\u4e01\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5254\u9664\u65e7\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u75c5\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.69%\uff08ResNet-50\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u548c2.36%\uff08UNI\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.09%\uff08ResNet-50\uff09\u548c3.75%\uff08UNI\uff09\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DeltaMIL\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u6574\u5408\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cdWSI\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose GANeXt, a 3D patch-based, fully ConvNeXt-powered generative adversarial network for unified CT synthesis across different modalities and anatomical regions. Specifically, GANeXt employs an efficient U-shaped generator constructed from stacked 3D ConvNeXt blocks with compact convolution kernels, while the discriminator adopts a conditional PatchGAN. To improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a combination of loss functions, including mean absolute error (MAE), perceptual loss, segmentation-based masked MAE, and adversarial loss and a combination of Dice loss and cross-entropy for multi-head segmentation discriminator. For both tasks, training is performed with a batch size of 8 using two separate AdamW optimizers for the generator and discriminator, each equipped with a warmup and cosine decay scheduler, with learning rates of $5\\times10^{-4}$ and $1\\times10^{-3}$, respectively. Data preprocessing includes deformable registration, foreground cropping, percentile normalization for the input modality, and linear normalization of the CT to the range $[-1024, 1000]$. Data augmentation involves random zooming within $(0.8, 1.3)$ (for MRI-to-CT only), fixed-size cropping to $32\\times160\\times192$ for MRI-to-CT and $32\\times128\\times128$ for CBCT-to-CT, and random flipping. During inference, we apply a sliding-window approach with $0.8$ overlap and average folding to reconstruct the full-size sCT, followed by inversion of the CT normalization. After joint training on all regions without any fine-tuning, the final models are selected at the end of 3000 epochs for MRI-to-CT and 1000 epochs for CBCT-to-CT using the full training dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGANeXt\u76843D Patch-based\u5168ConvNeXt\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\uff08MRI/CBCT\u2192CT\uff09\u548c\u591a\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7edf\u4e00CT\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "CT\u5408\u6210\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653e\u7597\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGANeXt\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e3D ConvNeXt\u7684U\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5668 + \u6761\u4ef6PatchGAN\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff1b\u5f15\u5165MAE\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u3001\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801MAE\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u5934\u5206\u5272\u5224\u522b\u5668\u7684Dice+\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53ccAdamW\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5e26warmup\u4e0e\u4f59\u5f26\u8870\u51cf\uff09\u3001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u6298\u53e0\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728MRI-to-CT\u548cCBCT-to-CT\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u540e\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u57283000\u548c1000\u4e2aepoch\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5408\u6210CT\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u89e3\u5256\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GANeXt\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7eafConvNeXt\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u591a\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653e\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7edf\u4e00CT\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Its core objective is to identify changes within change regions of interest (CRoI). Current multimodal large models encode rich human semantic knowledge, which is utilized for guidance in tasks such as remote sensing change detection. However, existing methods that use semantic guidance for detecting users' CRoI overly rely on explicit textual descriptions of CRoI, leading to the problem of near-complete performance failure when presented with implicit CRoI textual descriptions. This paper proposes a multimodal reasoning change detection model named ReasonCD, capable of mining users' implicit task intent. The model leverages the powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained large language models to mine users' implicit task intents and subsequently obtains different change detection results based on these intents.

However, ANNs rely on dense computation, which results in high power consumption. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs), which benefit from spike-driven computation, inherently provide low power consumption. Regrettably, the potential of SNNs for DVGL has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of spike-driven computation for representation learning scenarios also results in loss of critical information and difficulties in learning long-range dependencies when aligning heterogeneous visual data sources. To address these, we propose SpikeViMFormer, the first SNN framework designed for DVGL. In this framework, a lightweight spike-driven transformer backbone is adopted to extract coarse-grained features. To mitigate the loss of critical information, the spike-driven selective attention (SSA) block is designed, which uses a spike-driven gating mechanism to achieve selective feature enhancement and highlight discriminative regions. Furthermore, a spike-driven hybrid state space (SHS) block is introduced to learn long-range dependencies using a hybrid state space. Moreover, only the backbone is utilized during the inference stage to reduce computational cost. To ensure backbone effectiveness, a novel hierarchical re-ranking alignment learning (HRAL) strategy is proposed. It refines features via neighborhood re-ranking and maintains cross-batch consistency to directly optimize the backbone. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeViMFormer outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs. Compared with advanced ANNs, it also achieves competitive performance.Our code is available at https://github.com/ISChenawei/SpikeViMFormer", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08DVGL\uff09\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNN\uff09\u6846\u67b6SpikeViMFormer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8109\u51b2\u9a71\u52a8Transformer\u4e3b\u5e72\u3001\u8109\u51b2\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08SSA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u6df7\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08SHS\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301SNN\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u4e0e\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HRAL\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5148\u8fdbANN\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ANN\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u529f\u8017\u9ad8\uff1b\u800c\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNN\uff09\u867d\u5177\u5929\u7136\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5374\u5c1a\u672a\u5728DVGL\u4e2d\u88ab\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u8109\u51b2\u8ba1\u7b97\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u4e0e\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpikeViMFormer\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8109\u51b2\u9a71\u52a8Transformer\u4e3b\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8109\u51b2\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08SSA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8109\u51b2\u9a71\u52a8\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u8109\u51b2\u6df7\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08SHS\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b4\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u5e72\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\uff1b5\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HRAL\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90bb\u57df\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u8de8\u6279\u6b21\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3b\u5e72\u3002", "result": "SpikeViMFormer\u5728DVGL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdbANN\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907SNN\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "SpikeViMFormer\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u5c06SNN\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eDVGL\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u578b\u8109\u51b2\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5757\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86SNN\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Despite recent advances, current methods suffer from two critical challenges: prediction jitter across consecutive frames and poor discrimination of ambiguous phases. This paper aims to develop a stable framework by selectively propagating reliable historical information and explicitly modeling uncertainty for hard sample enhancement.\n  Methods: We propose a dual-pathway framework DSTED with Reliable Memory Propagation (RMP) and Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Retrieval (UPR). RMP maintains temporal coherence by filtering and fusing high-confidence historical features through multi-criteria reliability assessment. UPR constructs learnable class-specific prototypes from high-uncertainty samples and performs adaptive prototype matching to refine ambiguous frame representations. Finally, a confidence-driven gate dynamically balances both pathways based on prediction certainty.\n  Results: Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AutoLaparo-hysterectomy with 84.36% accuracy and 65.51% F1-score, surpassing the second-best method by 3.51% and 4.88% respectively. Ablations reveal complementary gains from RMP (2.19%) and UPR (1.93%), with synergistic effects when combined. Extensive analysis confirms substantial reduction in temporal jitter and marked improvement on challenging phase transitions.\n  Conclusion: Our dual-pathway design introduces a novel paradigm for stable workflow recognition, demonstrating that decoupling the modeling of temporal consistency and phase ambiguity yields superior performance and clinical applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6DSTED\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9760\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f20\u64ad\uff08RMP\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u539f\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\uff08UPR\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u624b\u672f\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f4d\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728AutoLaparo-hysterectomy\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u672f\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6296\u52a8\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u9636\u6bb5\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDSTED\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff1aRMP\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u51c6\u5219\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b5b\u9009\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5386\u53f2\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1bUPR\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7c7b\u522b\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u7cca\u5e27\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u7531\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u4e24\u8def\u5f84\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728AutoLaparo-hysterectomy\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f9784.36%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c65.51% F1-score\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9886\u5148\u6b21\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd53.51%\u548c4.88%\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aRMP\u548cUPR\u5206\u522b\u5e26\u67652.19%\u548c1.93%\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u95f4\u6296\u52a8\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u56f0\u96be\u76f8\u4f4d\u8fc7\u6e21\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u624b\u672f\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While traditionally diagnosed through invasive endoscopy, non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) presents a potential non-invasive alternative that has yet to be fully utilized in clinical practice. We present Multi-Organ-COhesion Network++ (MOON++), a novel multimodal framework that enhances EV assessment through comprehensive analysis of NCCT scans. Inspired by clinical evidence correlating organ volumetric relationships with liver disease severity, MOON++ synthesizes imaging characteristics of the esophagus, liver, and spleen through multimodal learning. We evaluated our approach using 1,631 patients, those with endoscopically confirmed EV were classified into four severity grades.

However, developing effective and efficient Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods to unlock their full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose dMLLM-TTS, a novel framework operating on two complementary scaling axes: (1) trajectory exploration scaling to enhance the diversity of generated hypotheses, and (2) iterative refinement scaling for stable generation. Conventional TTS approaches typically perform linear search across these two dimensions, incurring substantial computational costs of O(NT) and requiring an external verifier for best-of-N selection. To overcome these limitations, we propose two innovations. First, we design an efficient hierarchical search algorithm with O(N+T) complexity that adaptively expands and prunes sampling trajectories. Second, we introduce a self-verified feedback mechanism that leverages the dMLLMs' intrinsic image understanding capabilities to assess text-image alignment, eliminating the need for external verifier. Extensive experiments on the GenEval benchmark across three representative dMLLMs (e.g., Lumina-DiMOO, MMaDA, Muddit) show that our framework substantially improves generation quality while achieving up to 6x greater efficiency than linear search.

This design lacks explicit collaboration, leaving no structured mechanism for the embedder to incorporate decoding-aware cues or for the extractor to guide embedding during training. To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction. AFMM enables content-aware feature regulation by decoupling modulation structure and strength, guiding watermark embedding toward stable image features while suppressing host interference during extraction. Under CIM, the AFMMs on both sides form a closed-loop collaboration that aligns embedding behavior with extraction objectives. This architecture-level redesign changes how robustness is learned in watermarking systems. Rather than relying on exhaustive distortion simulation, robustness emerges from coordinated representation learning between embedding and extraction.

While token pruning offers a path to acceleration, we find that current methods, while adequate for general understanding, catastrophically fail on fine-grained localization tasks. We attribute this failure to the inherent flaws of the two prevailing strategies: importance-based methods suffer from a strong positional bias, an inherent model artifact that distracts from semantic content, while diversity-based methods exhibit structural blindness, disregarding the user's prompt and spatial redundancy. To address this, we introduce D2Pruner, a framework that rectifies these issues by uniquely combining debiased importance with a structural pruning mechanism. Our method first secures a core set of the most critical tokens as pivots based on a debiased attention score. It then performs a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) selection on the remaining tokens, which are modeled on a hybrid graph where edges signify spatial proximity and semantic similarity. This process iteratively preserves the most important and available token while removing its neighbors, ensuring that the supplementary tokens are chosen to maximize importance and diversity.

Owing to the importance of emotion in advertising, emotion-oriented image generation has attracted increasing attention. However, current emotion-oriented methods suffer from an affective shortcut, where emotions are approximated to semantics. As evidenced by two decades of research, emotion is not equivalent to semantics. To this end, we propose Emotion-Director, a cross-modal collaboration framework consisting of two modules. First, we propose a cross-Modal Collaborative diffusion model, abbreviated as MC-Diffusion. MC-Diffusion integrates visual prompts with textual prompts for guidance, enabling the generation of emotion-oriented images beyond semantics. Further, we improve the DPO optimization by a negative visual prompt, enhancing the model's sensitivity to different emotions under the same semantics. Second, we propose MC-Agent, a cross-Modal Collaborative Agent system that rewrites textual prompts to express the intended emotions. To avoid template-like rewrites, MC-Agent employs multi-agents to simulate human subjectivity toward emotions, and adopts a chain-of-concept workflow that improves the visual expressiveness of the rewritten prompts.

Since DMIR processes two images simultaneously as input, the combination relationships between features has grown exponentially, ultimately the model considers more interfering features during the feature modeling process. Introducing dynamics in the receptive fields and weights of the network enable the model to eliminate the interfering features combination and model the potential feature combination relationships. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Stream Network (DySNet), which enables the receptive fields and weights to be dynamically adjusted. This ultimately enables the model to ignore interfering feature combinations and model the potential feature relationships. With two key innovations: 1) Adaptive Stream Basin (AdSB) module dynamically adjusts the shape of the receptive field, thereby enabling the model to focus on the feature relationships with greater correlation. 2) Dynamic Stream Attention (DySA) mechanism generates dynamic weights to search for more valuable feature relationships.

Under review at IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (JSTARS)", "summary": "Modern deep learning models operating on multi-modal visual signals often rely on inductive biases that are poorly aligned with the physical processes governing signal formation, leading to brittle performance under cross-spectral and real-world conditions. In particular, approaches that prioritise direct thermal cues struggle to capture indirect yet persistent environmental alterations induced by sustained heat emissions.\n  This work introduces a physics-aware representation learning framework that leverages multi-spectral information to model stable signatures of long-term physical processes. Specifically, a geological Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) ratio sensitive to soil property changes is integrated with Thermal Infrared (TIR) data through an intermediate fusion architecture, instantiated as FusionNet. The proposed backbone embeds trainable differential signal-processing priors within convolutional layers, combines mixed pooling strategies, and employs wider receptive fields to enhance robustness across spectral modalities.\n  Systematic ablations show that each architectural component contributes to performance gains, with DGCNN achieving 88.7% accuracy on the SWIR ratio and FusionNet reaching 90.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across five spectral configurations. Transfer learning experiments further show that ImageNet pretraining degrades TIR performance, highlighting the importance of modality-aware training for cross-spectral learning.\n  Evaluated on real-world data, the results demonstrate that combining physics-aware feature selection with principled deep learning architectures yields robust and generalisable representations, illustrating how first-principles signal modelling can improve multi-spectral learning under challenging conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6FusionNet\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5730\u8d28\u77ed\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\uff08SWIR\uff09\u6bd4\u503c\u4e0e\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\uff08TIR\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u6210\u50cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u8106\u5f31\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u7531\u6301\u7eed\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u4f46\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFusionNet\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8054\u5408SWIR\u6bd4\u503c\uff08\u654f\u611f\u4e8e\u571f\u58e4\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u4e0eTIR\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5728\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u6c60\u5316\u4e0e\u66f4\u5bbd\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u3002", "result": "FusionNet\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u5149\u8c31\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\uff1aSWIR\u6bd4\u503c\u5206\u7c7b\u8fbe88.7%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u8fbe90.6%\uff1bImageNet\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53cd\u800c\u635f\u5bb3TIR\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u539f\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses. Comprehensive experiments on the SGG-VQA and OmniMedVQA benchmarks show our method achieves a significant improvement across the two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the medical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. The code can be found in https://github.com/tomato996/Anatomy-R1", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u89e3\u5256\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u5256\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ec4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfGRPO\u5728\u89e3\u5256\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728SGG-VQA\u548cOmniMedVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u5256\u624b\u672f\u56fe\u50cf\u7b49\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5GRPO\u5728\u89e3\u5256\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u56f0\u96be\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u8fc7\u65e9\u6536\u655b\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u89e3\u5256\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b54\u6848\u9009\u9879\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2\uff09\u7ec4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u589e\u5f3a\uff08Group Diversity Question Augmentation\uff09\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u56f0\u96be\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728SGG-VQA\u548cOmniMedVQA\u4e24\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347MLLM\u533b\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86GRPO\u5728\u89e3\u5256\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9694\u79bb\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u50f5\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66MLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002"}}

WACV 2026", "summary": "In this work we propose a multi-modal architecture for analyzing soccer scenes from tactical camera footage, with a focus on three core tasks: ball trajectory inference, ball state classification, and ball possessor identification. To this end, our solution integrates three distinct input modalities (player trajectories, player types and image crops of individual players) into a unified framework that processes spatial and temporal dynamics using a cascade of sociotemporal transformer blocks. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on accurate ball tracking or handcrafted heuristics, our approach infers the ball trajectory without direct access to its past or future positions, and robustly identifies the ball state and ball possessor under noisy or occluded conditions from real top league matches.

Although preformed orbital plates are widely used to reduce cost and operative time compared with customized implants, surgeons currently lack publicly available tools and standardized metrics to quantitatively compare plate fit across vendors, sizes, and patient anatomy. We developed SlicerOrbitSurgerySim, an open-source extension for the 3D Slicer platform that enables interactive virtual registration, evaluation, and comparison of multiple preformed orbital plates in a patient-specific virtual planning environment. The software generates reproducible quantitative plate-to-orbit distance metrics and visualization tools that support both patient-specific planning and population-level statistical analysis of plate adaptability. By facilitating objective comparison of implant designs and placement strategies, this tool aims to improve preoperative decision-making, reduce intraoperative plate modification, and promote collaborative research and surgical education.

This allows text and image information to fully attend to one another within the model, but becomes extremely costly for high-resolution images, long conversations, or streaming videos, both in memory and compute. VLMs leveraging cross-attention are an efficient alternative to token insertion but exhibit a clear performance gap, in particular on tasks involving fine-grained visual details. We find that a key to improving such models is to also enable local text-to-text interaction in the dedicated cross-attention layers. Building on this, we propose CASA, Cross-Attention via Self-Attention, a simple and efficient paradigm which substantially reduces the gap with full token insertion on common image understanding benchmarks, while enjoying the same scalability as cross-attention models when applied to long-context multimodal tasks such as streaming video captioning.

Inspired by human memory, we propose StoryMem, a paradigm that reformulates long-form video storytelling as iterative shot synthesis conditioned on explicit visual memory, transforming pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models into multi-shot storytellers. This is achieved by a novel Memory-to-Video (M2V) design, which maintains a compact and dynamically updated memory bank of keyframes from historical generated shots. The stored memory is then injected into single-shot video diffusion models via latent concatenation and negative RoPE shifts with only LoRA fine-tuning. A semantic keyframe selection strategy, together with aesthetic preference filtering, further ensures informative and stable memory throughout generation. Moreover, the proposed framework naturally accommodates smooth shot transitions and customized story generation applications. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce ST-Bench, a diverse benchmark for multi-shot video storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StoryMem achieves superior cross-shot consistency over previous methods while preserving high aesthetic quality and prompt adherence, marking a significant step toward coherent minute-long video storytelling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faStoryMem\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u591a\u955c\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u53d9\u4e8b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Memory-to-Video\uff08M2V\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u955c\u5934\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u5177\u5907\u957f\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u591a\u955c\u5934\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86ST-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u517c\u987e cinematic \u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8de8\u955c\u5934\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStoryMem\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662fMemory-to-Video\uff08M2V\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u5386\u53f2\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u6784\u6210\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u62fc\u63a5\u4e0e\u8d1fRoPE\u504f\u79fb\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u955c\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u8f85\u4ee5\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u7f8e\u5b66\u504f\u597d\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u591a\u955c\u5934\u89c6\u9891\u53d9\u4e8b\u57fa\u51c6ST-Bench\u4e0a\uff0cStoryMem\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u955c\u5934\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u89c6\u9891\u6545\u4e8b\u3002", "conclusion": "StoryMem\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bf9\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

We present ActAvatar, a framework that achieves phase-level precision in action control through textual guidance by capturing both action semantics and temporal context. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA), which decomposes prompts into a global base block and temporally-anchored phase blocks, enabling the model to concentrate on phase-relevant tokens for precise temporal-semantic alignment; (2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment, which aligns modality influence with the hierarchical feature learning process-early layers prioritize text for establishing action structure while deeper layers emphasize audio for refining lip movements, preventing modality interference; (3) A two-stage training strategy that first establishes robust audio-visual correspondence on diverse data, then injects action control through fine-tuning on structured annotations, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and the model's text-following capabilities.

We introduce BabyFlow, a generative AI model that disentangles facial identity and expression, enabling independent control over both. Using normalizing flows, BabyFlow learns flexible, probabilistic representations that capture the complex, non-linear variability of expressive infant faces without restrictive linear assumptions. To address scarce and uncontrolled expressive data, we perform cross-age expression transfer, adapting expressions from adult 3D scans to enrich infant datasets with realistic and systematic expressive variants. As a result, BabyFlow improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, particularly in highly expressive regions such as the mouth, eyes, and nose, and supports synthesis and modification of infant expressions while preserving identity. Additionally, by integrating with diffusion models, BabyFlow generates high-fidelity 2D infant images with consistent 3D geometry, providing powerful tools for data augmentation and early facial analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "BabyFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u8026\u5a74\u513f\u9762\u90e8\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u8868\u60c5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5e74\u9f84\u8868\u60c5\u8fc1\u79fb\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f2D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f43D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5a74\u513f\u9762\u90e83D\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u53d1\u80b2\u969c\u788d\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u80b2\u969c\u788d\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u5206\u6790\u5a74\u513f\u9885\u9762\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5a74\u513f\u9762\u90e8\u5efa\u6a21\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u81ea\u53d1\u8868\u60c5\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBabyFlow\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8868\u5f81\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u8868\u60c5\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u5e74\u9f84\u8868\u60c5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5c06\u6210\u4eba3D\u8868\u60c5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5a74\u513f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4ee5\u6269\u5145\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8868\u8fbe\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u878d\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f43D\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f2D\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5a74\u513f\u9762\u90e83D\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5634\u3001\u773c\u3001\u9f3b\u7b49\u9ad8\u8868\u60c5\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u8868\u60c5\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u76842D\u56fe\u50cf\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u9762\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "BabyFlow\u4e3a\u5a74\u513f\u9762\u90e8\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e0e\u53d1\u80b2\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

No Problem: Robust Vision-Tabular Learning with Missing Values", "comment": null, "summary": "Large-scale medical biobanks provide imaging data complemented by extensive tabular information, such as demographics or clinical measurements. However, this abundance of tabular attributes does not reflect real-world datasets, where only a subset of attributes may be available. This discrepancy calls for methods that can leverage all the tabular data during training while remaining robust to missing values at inference. To address this challenge, we propose RoVTL (Robust Vision-Tabular Learning), a framework designed to handle any level of tabular data availability, from 0% to 100%. RoVTL comprises two key stages: contrastive pretraining, where we introduce tabular attribute missingness as data augmentation to promote robustness, and downstream task tuning using a gated cross-attention module for multimodal fusion. During fine-tuning, we employ a novel Tabular More vs. Fewer loss that ranks performance based on the amount of available tabular data. Combined with disentangled gradient learning, this enables consistent performance across all tabular data completeness scenarios. We evaluate RoVTL on cardiac MRI scans from the UK Biobank, demonstrating superior robustness to missing tabular data compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RoVTL successfully generalizes to an external cardiac MRI dataset for multimodal disease classification, and extends to the natural images domain, achieving robust performance on a car advertisements dataset.

Unlike humans, who can quickly learn to parse and navigate maps, current models often fail to respect fundamental path constraints, in part due to the prohibitive cost and difficulty of collecting large-scale, pixel-accurate path annotations. To address this, we introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise annotations for this challenging task. Using this pipeline, we construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23k path samples across 4k maps, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities. Using this dataset, we fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs. Results on MapBench show that finetuning substantially improves robustness, raising success rates by up to 6.4 points, while also reducing path-tracing error (NDTW).

This paper investigates diffusion-based generative modeling to address these challenges through plant image synthesis, indoor-to-outdoor translation, and expert preference aligned fine tuning. First, a Stable Diffusion model is fine tuned on captioned indoor and outdoor plant imagery to generate realistic, text conditioned images of canola and soybean. Evaluation using Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance, and downstream phenotype classification shows that synthetic images effectively augment training data and improve accuracy. Second, we bridge the gap between high resolution indoor datasets and limited outdoor imagery using DreamBooth-based text inversion and image guided diffusion, generating translated images that enhance weed detection and classification with YOLOv8. Finally, a preference guided fine tuning framework trains a reward model on expert scores and applies reward weighted updates to produce more stable and expert aligned outputs.

Existing video generative models struggle to preserve the input video while adding such effects, and current video inpainting methods either require costly per-frame masks or yield implausible results. We introduce augmented compositing, a new task that synthesizes realistic, semi-transparent environmental effects conditioned on text prompts and input video layers, while preserving the original scene. To address this task, we present Over++, a video effect generation framework that makes no assumptions about camera pose, scene stationarity, or depth supervision. We construct a paired effect dataset tailored for this task and introduce an unpaired augmentation strategy that preserves text-driven editability. Our method also supports optional mask control and keyframe guidance without requiring dense annotations.

While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP.

Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff). Results: Our model achieved superior performance with exceptional efficiency. For 7T brain data: SSIM=0.951+-0.021, PSNR=26.90+-1.41 dB, LPIPS=0.076+-0.022, GMSD=0.083+-0.017, significantly outperforming all baselines (p<0.001). For prostate data: SSIM=0.770+-0.049, PSNR=27.15+-2.19 dB, LPIPS=0.190+-0.095, GMSD=0.087+-0.013. The framework used only 0.9M parameters and 57 GFLOPs, reducing parameters by 99.8% and computation by 97.5% versus Res-SRDiff, while outperforming SwinIR and MambaIR in accuracy and efficiency.

This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a \"fill-and-revise\" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

However, tokenizers are trained to reconstruct clean images from ground-truth tokens, while AR generators are optimized only for token likelihood. This misalignment leads to generated token sequences that may decode into low-quality images, without direct supervision from the pixel space. We propose VA-$\u03c0$, a lightweight post-training framework that directly optimizes AR models with a principled pixel-space objective. VA-$\u03c0$ formulates the generator-tokenizer alignment as a variational optimization, deriving an evidence lower bound (ELBO) that unifies pixel reconstruction and autoregressive modeling. To optimize under the discrete token space, VA-$\u03c0$ introduces a reinforcement-based alignment strategy that treats the AR generator as a policy, uses pixel-space reconstruction quality as its intrinsic reward. The reward is measured by how well the predicted token sequences can reconstruct the original image under teacher forcing, giving the model direct pixel-level guidance without expensive free-running sampling. The regularization term of the ELBO serves as a natural regularizer, maintaining distributional consistency of tokens. VA-$\u03c0$ enables rapid adaptation of existing AR generators, without neither tokenizer retraining nor external reward models. With only 1% ImageNet-1K data and 25 minutes of tuning, it reduces FID from 14.36 to 7.65 and improves IS from 86.55 to 116.70 on LlamaGen-XXL, while also yielding notable gains in the text-to-image task on GenEval for both visual generation model (LlamaGen: from 0.306 to 0.339) and unified multi-modal model (Janus-Pro: from 0.725 to 0.744).

Existing benchmarks fall short of diagnosing this limitation: they either focus on overly simplified qualitative reasoning or rely on domain-specific indoor data, constrained by the lack of outdoor datasets with verifiable metric ground truth. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale benchmark built from pedestrian-perspective videos captured with synchronized stereo cameras, LiDAR, and IMU/GPS sensors. This dataset provides metrically precise 3D information, enabling the automatic generation of spatial reasoning questions that span a hierarchical spectrum--from qualitative relational reasoning to quantitative metric and kinematic understanding. Evaluations reveal that the performance gains observed in structured indoor benchmarks vanish in open-world settings. Further analysis using synthetic abnormal scenes and blinding tests confirms that current MLLMs depend heavily on linguistic priors instead of grounded visual reasoning. Our benchmark thus provides a principled platform for diagnosing these limitations and advancing physically grounded spatial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u540c\u6b65\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u6237\u5916\u884c\u4eba\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9-\u7269\u7406 grounding\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bca\u65adMLLMs\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u3001\u5177\u8eab\u3001\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5ea6\u91cf\u771f\u503c\u7684\u6237\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u6b65\u7acb\u4f53\u76f8\u673a\u3001LiDAR\u548cIMU/GPS\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5176\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea63D\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8986\u76d6\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u2018\u81f4\u76f2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u2019\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1aMLLMs\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5ba4\u5185\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6d88\u5931\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u7269\u7406 grounding\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bca\u65adMLLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u5177\u5907\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, it is observed that the current thinking process during generation mainly focuses on the text consistency with the text prompt, ignoring the \\textbf{visual context consistency} with the visual reference images during the multi-modal generation, e.g., multi-reference generation. The lack of such consistency results in the failure in maintaining key visual features (like human ID, object attribute, style). To this end, we integrate the visual context consistency into the reasoning of unified models, explicitly motivating the model to sustain such consistency by 1) Adaptive Visual Planning: generating structured visual check list to figure out the visual element of needed consistency keeping, and 2) Iterative Visual Correction: performing self-reflection with the guidance of check lists and refining the generated result in an iterative manner. To achieve this, we use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to plan the visual checking, conduct self-reflection and self-refinement, and use flow-GRPO to further enhance the visual consistency through a customized visual checking reward.

Due to limitations in available data and increased learning complexity, previous methods tend to ignore hand motions, limiting the realism and expressivity of the interactions. Additionally, current diffusion-based approaches generate entire motion sequences simultaneously, limiting their ability to capture the reactive and adaptive nature of human interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce Interact2Ar, the first end-to-end text-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model for generating full-body, human-human interactions. Interact2Ar incorporates detailed hand kinematics through dedicated parallel branches, enabling high-fidelity full-body generation. Furthermore, we introduce an autoregressive pipeline coupled with a novel memory technique that facilitates adaptation to the inherent variability of human interactions using efficient large context windows. The adaptability of our model enables a series of downstream applications, including temporal motion composition, real-time adaptation to disturbances, and extension beyond dyadic to multi-person scenarios. To validate the generated motions, we introduce a set of robust evaluators and extended metrics designed specifically for assessing full-body interactions.

In this paper, we systematically analyze the spectral characteristics of various semantic and pixel encoders. Interestingly, our study uncovers a highly inspiring and rarely explored correspondence between an encoder's feature spectrum and its functional role: semantic encoders primarily capture low-frequency components that encode abstract meaning, whereas pixel encoders additionally retain high-frequency information that conveys fine-grained detail. This heuristic finding offers a unifying perspective that ties encoder behavior to its underlying spectral structure. We define it as the Prism Hypothesis, where each data modality can be viewed as a projection of the natural world onto a shared feature spectrum, just like the prism. Building on this insight, we propose Unified Autoencoding (UAE), a model that harmonizes semantic structure and pixel details via an innovative frequency-band modulator, enabling their seamless coexistence. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS-COCO benchmarks validate that our UAE effectively unifies semantic abstraction and pixel-level fidelity into a single latent space with state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPrism Hypothesis\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u83b7\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u50cf\u7d20\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Unified Autoencoding\uff08UAE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u5e26\u8c03\u5236\u5668\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5728ImageNet\u548cMS-COCO\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5c42\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u5c11\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u5176\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u76f8\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPrism Hypothesis\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1Unified Autoencoding\uff08UAE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u9891\u5e26\u8c03\u5236\u5668\u4ee5\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u4f4e\u9891\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u548cMS-COCO\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86UAE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8fbestate-of-the-art\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u53ef\u7531\u5176\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u5e03\u89e3\u91ca\uff1bPrism Hypothesis\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0cUAE\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}
