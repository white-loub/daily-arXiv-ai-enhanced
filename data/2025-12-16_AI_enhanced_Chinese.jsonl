This paper presents a field dataset and behavioral analysis of Tesla's Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (TLSSC), a mature ADAS that perceives traffic lights and stop signs. We design and execute experiments across varied speed limits and TCD types, collecting synchronized high-resolution vehicle trajectory data and driver-perspective video. From these data, we develop a taxonomy of TLSSC-TCD interaction behaviors (i.e., stopping, accelerating, and car following) and calibrate the Full Velocity Difference Model (FVDM) to quantitatively characterize each behavior mode. A novel empirical insight is the identification of a car-following threshold (~90 m). Calibration results reveal that stopping behavior is driven by strong responsiveness to both desired speed deviation and relative speed, whereas accelerating behavior is more conservative. Intersection car-following behavior exhibits smoother dynamics and tighter headways compared to standard car-following behaviors. The established dataset, behavior definitions, and model characterizations together provide a foundation for future simulation, safety evaluation, and design of ADAS-TCD interaction logic.

While autoregressive large language models and continuous diffusion policies are prevalent, the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation remains largely unexplored. This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving.

We propose a novel second-order constrained optimization framework featuring a custom augmented Lagrangian solver that avoids TOI locking by immediately incorporating all requisite contact pairs detected via CCD, enabling more efficient active-set exploration and leading to significantly fewer Newton iterations. By adaptively updating Lagrange multipliers rather than increasing penalty stiffness, our method prevents stagnation at zero TOI while maintaining a well-conditioned system. We further introduce a constraint filtering and decay mechanism to keep the active set compact and stable, along with a theoretical justification of our method's finite-step termination and first-order time integration accuracy under a cumulative TOI-based termination criterion. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of our method.

Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts inherent in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geospatial knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress transient visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVPR-AttLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d4c\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff08VPR\uff09\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u6d2a\u6c34\u7b49\u5371\u673a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u65b0\u589e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3001\u8de8\u6e90\u9c81\u68d2\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4f17\u5305\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u6620\u57ce\u5e02\u6d2a\u6d9d\u7b49\u5371\u673a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7406\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u73b0\u6709VPR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u6e90\u3001\u542b\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\u548c\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5371\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684VPR-AttLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u7406\u89e3\u57ce\u5e02\u8bed\u5883\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3aVPR\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u77ac\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728SF-XL\uff08\u589e\u8865\u771f\u5b9e\u6d2a\u6c34\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u3001\u5408\u6210\u6d2a\u6c34\u67e5\u8be2\u96c6\u3001Mapillary\u53ca\u65b0\u6784\u5efaHK-URBAN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u96c6\u6210CosPlace/EigenPlaces/SALAD\u540e\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53471\u20133%\uff0c\u6700\u96be\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6d2a\u6c34\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fbe8%\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u7acbLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "VPR-AttLLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3VPR\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5176\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5f3a\u8de8\u6e90\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u5371\u673a\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5feb\u901f\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u83b1\u5e03\u5c3c\u8328\u5355\u5b50\u8bba\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u5e74\u9f84\u5206\u6570\uff08AAS\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8001\u5316\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u65bd\u52a0\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3001\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u7ec4Python\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u754c\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u2018\u7c7b\u81ea\u6211\u2019\u884c\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u54f2\u5b66\uff08\u5982\u5355\u5b50\u8bba\uff09\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u83b1\u5e03\u5c3c\u8328\u300a\u5355\u5b50\u8bba\u300b\u4e2d20\u4e2a\u5355\u5b50\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e3a6\u4e2a\u54f2\u5b66\u8303\u7574\uff08\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u610f\u8bc6\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u7c7b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eAAS\u6838\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6761\u6b3e\uff1b\u57286\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Python\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u56de\u5fc6\u5f97\u5206\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u3001\u6743\u91cd\uff09\u5f00\u5c55\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u2018\u8f93\u5165\u8bbe\u7f6e\u2192\u6761\u6b3e\u5b9e\u73b0\u2192\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u2192\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542f\u793a\u2019\u56db\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6761\u6b3e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u901f\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u7684AAS\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u5bf9\u77db\u76fe\u4e0e\u65e0\u4f9d\u636e\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u3001\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ec6\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u673a\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u548c\u8c10\u9879\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5ea6\u7a97\u53e3\u6f02\u79fb\u533a\u5206\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0e\u9000\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5355\u5b50\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5AAS\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9762\u5411LLM\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u900f\u660e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u54f2\u5b66\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce value profiles: a small set of reusable bundles of value-related parameters (outcome preferences, policy priors, and policy precision) assigned to hidden states in a generative model. As posterior beliefs over states evolve trial by trial, effective control parameters arise via belief-weighted mixing, enabling state-conditional strategy recruitment without requiring independent parameters for each context. We evaluate this framework in probabilistic reversal learning, comparing static-precision, entropy-coupled dynamic-precision, and profile-based models using cross-validated log-likelihood and information criteria. Model comparison favors the profile-based model over simpler alternatives (about 100-point AIC differences), and parameter-recovery analyses support structural identifiability even when context must be inferred from noisy observations. Model-based inference further suggests that adaptive control in this task is driven primarily by modulation of policy priors rather than policy precision, with gradual belief-dependent profile recruitment consistent with state-conditional (not purely uncertainty-driven) control.

This thesis presents a traversability-aware navigation framework for the M4 robot platform that uses learned terrain analysis to generate energy-efficient paths avoiding difficult terrain.Our approach uses FAST-LIO for real-time localization, generating 2.5D elevation maps from LiDAR point clouds. A CNN-based model processes these elevation maps to estimate traversability scores, which are converted into navigation costs for path planning. A custom A* planner incorporates these costs alongside geometric distance and energy consumption to find paths that trade modest distance increases for substantial terrain quality improvements. Before system development, a platform-agnostic study compared LiDAR-based and camera-based SLAM using OptiTrack ground truth. Point cloud comparison through ICP alignment and cloud-to-mesh distance analysis demonstrated that LiDAR-based mapping achieves centimeter-level precision essential for elevation mapping, while camera-based approaches exhibited significantly higher geometric error. These findings directly resulted in the selection of LiDAR as the primary sensor to generate elevation maps. The complete pipeline integrates FAST-LIO localization, GPU-accelerated elevation mapping, CNN-based traversability estimation, and Nav2 navigation with a custom traversability-aware planner. Experimental results demonstrate that the system successfully avoids low traversability regions and accepts a few longer paths to achieve a reduction in terrain cost.

These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. We propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment.

However, classical theory predicts such tasks should suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where distances between points become nearly indistinguishable, thereby crippling efficient nearest-neighbor search. We revisit this paradox through the lens of stability, the property that small perturbations to a query do not radically alter its nearest neighbors. Building on foundational results, we extend stability theory to three key retrieval settings widely used in practice: (i) multi-vector search, where we prove that the popular Chamfer distance metric preserves single-vector stability, while average pooling aggregation may destroy it; (ii) filtered vector search, where we show that sufficiently large penalties for mismatched filters can induce stability even when the underlying search is unstable; and (iii) sparse vector search, where we formalize and prove novel sufficient stability conditions.

Wallis"], "title": "MRD: Using Physically Based Differentiable Rendering to Probe Vision Models for 3D Scene Understanding", "comment": "18 pages, 6 figures. Supplementary material and code will be provided at the end of January", "summary": "While deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in many vision benchmarks, it remains difficult to understand and explain the representations and decisions of these models. Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material).

To bypass this, latent-space thinking allows models to think using the continuous embedding space. While existing methods for training those models show domain-specific gains, they fail to maintain performance in complex tasks, such as mathematical reasoning. We experimentally demonstrate that the Coconut approach, a form of supervised fine-tuning for latent-space thinking, is highly sensitive to design choices and exhibits several inherent limitations. To address these issues, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques -- an underexplored direction in latent-space thinking -- including GRPO and design a novel Latent RL method for directly optimizing the latent thinking steps. Our experimental results reveal that these RL-trained models still lag behind traditional language-space CoT models in the mathematical reasoning domain.

There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology. Further, we propose a construction heuristic as well as a tailored metaheuristic using local search to efficiently tackle large-scale problem instances. This metaheuristic approach has been deployed and is currently being used in an industrial setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u673a\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u4f18\u5148\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u65e5\u5386\u578b\u7d2f\u79ef\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\uff08\u7ea6\u675f\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u3001\u6784\u9020\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u540e\u8005\u5df2\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u65e5\u5386\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\uff09\u3001\u6784\u9020\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5e76\u6295\u5165\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e76\u884c\u673a\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u987e\u5efa\u6a21\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

Current AI models are good at finding correlations (or patterns) in medical images. Still, they often struggle to understand the deeper cause-and-effect relationships between those patterns and a patient condition. Causal inference is a powerful approach that goes beyond identifying patterns to uncover why certain findings in an X-ray relate to a specific diagnosis. In this paper, we will explore the prompt-driven framework Causal Reasoning for Patient-Centric Explanations in radiology Report Generation (CR3G) that is applied to chest X-ray analysis to improve understanding of AI-generated reports by focusing on cause-and-effect relationships, reasoning and generate patient-centric explanation. The aim to enhance the quality of AI-driven diagnostics, making them more useful and trustworthy in clinical practice.

Anchor-based approaches such as Anchor3DLane have demonstrated strong performance by regressing continuous 3D lane curves from multi-camera surround views. However, the baseline model still exhibits (i) sensitivity to regression outliers, (ii) weak supervision of global curve geometry, (iii) difficulty in balancing multiple loss terms, and (iv) limited exploitation of temporal continuity. We propose Temporal-Anchor3DLane, an enhanced 3D lane detection framework that extends Anchor3DLane with three key contributions: (1) a set of multi-task loss improvements, including Balanced L1 regression, Chamfer point-set distance, and uncertainty-based loss weighting, together with focal and Dice components for classification and visibility; (2) a lightweight Temporal LSTM Fusion module that aggregates per-anchor features across frames, replacing a heavier Transformer-style temporal fusion; and (3) ESCOP-style training refinements that couple curve-level supervision with temporal consistency. On OpenLane, Temporal-Anchor3DLane improves F1 by +6.2 and yields smoother temporal trajectories, showing that small architectural and loss refinements significantly enhance 3D lane robustness without extra sensors or scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTemporal-Anchor3DLane\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u635f\u5931\u6539\u8fdb\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u5e8fLSTM\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548cESCOP\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u76ee3D\u8f66\u9053\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u76ee3D\u8f66\u9053\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caAnchor3DLane\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u5f02\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u51e0\u4f55\u76d1\u7763\u5f31\u3001\u591a\u635f\u5931\u5e73\u8861\u96be\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u5728Anchor3DLane\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a(1) \u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u635f\u5931\uff08Balanced L1\u56de\u5f52\u3001Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u3001focal\u4e0eDice\u5206\u7c7b/\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff09\uff1b(2) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Temporal LSTM Fusion\u6a21\u5757\u66ff\u4ee3Transformer\u5f0f\u65f6\u5e8f\u878d\u5408\uff1b(3) ESCOP\u98ce\u683c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u66f2\u7ebf\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenLane\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF1\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347+6.2\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a3D\u8f66\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u635f\u5931\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee3D\u8f66\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

This thesis develops a complete autonomy pipeline for COBRA, an 11 degree-of-freedom modular snake robot designed for planetary exploration. While the robot's biologically inspired serpentine gaits achieve impressive mobility, prior work has relied entirely on open-loop teleoperation. This approach integrates onboard visual-inertial SLAM, reduced-order state estimation, and closed-loop trajectory tracking to enable autonomous waypoint navigation. A depth camera paired with edge computing performs real-time localization during dynamic locomotion, validated against motion-capture ground truth to characterize drift behavior and failure modes unique to snake robot platforms. A reduced-order framework estimates Center-of-Mass pose, driving a closed-loop controller that modulates CPG gait parameters through distance-dependent yaw error blending. Physical experiments validate the complete system, demonstrating accurate multi-waypoint tracking and establishing foundations for autonomous snake robot navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u884c\u661f\u63a2\u6d4b\u768411\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u86c7\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4ebaCOBRA\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u60ef\u6027SLAM\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u591a\u822a\u70b9\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u86c7\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u867d\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5353\u8d8a\u673a\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u96be\u9898\u4e9f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u673a\u8f7d\u89c6\u89c9-\u60ef\u6027SLAM\u3001\u964d\u9636\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u5fc3\u4f4d\u59ff\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eCPG\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u76f8\u673a\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u504f\u822a\u8bef\u5dee\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u4e2d\u67a2\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u751f\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u591a\u822a\u70b9\u81ea\u4e3b\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6f02\u79fb\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u86c7\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u86c7\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5728\u884c\u661f\u63a2\u6d4b\u7b49\u524d\u6cbf\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

Quantigence decomposes research objectives into specialized roles - Cryptographic Analyst, Threat Modeler, Standards Specialist, and Risk Assessor - coordinated by a supervisory agent. Using \"cognitive parallelism,\" agents reason independently to maintain context purity while execution is serialized on resource-constrained hardware (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 2060).

Recent advances leverage Transformer-based architectures to capture global dependencies, but existing methods often suffer from high computational overhead, primarily due to discontinuous memory access in temporal encoding and dense attention over long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose FuXi-$\u03b3$, a novel sequential recommendation framework that improves both effectiveness and efficiency through principled architectural design. FuXi-$\u03b3$ adopts a decoder-only Transformer structure and introduces two key innovations: (1) An exponential-power temporal encoder that encodes relative temporal intervals using a tunable exponential decay function inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. This encoder enables flexible modeling of both short-term and long-term preferences while maintaining high efficiency through continuous memory access and pure matrix operations. (2) A diagonal-sparse positional mechanism that prunes low-contribution attention blocks using a diagonal-sliding strategy guided by the persymmetry of Toeplitz matrix. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FuXi-$\u03b3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation quality, while accelerating training by up to 4.74$\\times$ and inference by up to 6.18$\\times$, making it a practical and scalable solution for long-sequence recommendation.

Photon mapping provides physically grounded estimates of complex global illumination effects such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, yet its per-view radiance estimation remains computationally inefficient when rendering multiple views of the same scene. The inefficiency arises from independent photon tracing and stochastic kernel estimation at each viewpoint, leading to inevitable redundant computation. To accelerate multi-view rendering, we reformulate photon mapping as a continuous and reusable radiance function. Specifically, we introduce the Gaussian Photon Field (GPF), a learnable representation that encodes photon distributions as anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives parameterized by position, rotation, scale, and spectrum. GPF is initialized from physically traced photons in the first SPPM iteration and optimized using multi-view supervision of final radiance, distilling photon-based light transport into a continuous field. Once trained, the field enables differentiable radiance evaluation along camera rays without repeated photon tracing or iterative refinement. Extensive experiments on scenes with complex light transport, such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, demonstrate that GPF attains photon-level accuracy while reducing computation by orders of magnitude, unifying the physical rigor of photon-based rendering with the efficiency of neural scene representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u5b50\u573a\uff08GPF\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8f90\u5c04\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u5149\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u60273D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u56e0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u89d2\u9700\u72ec\u7acb\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u5b50\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6838\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u5b50\u573a\uff08GPF\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5149\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u60273D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\uff1bGPF\u7531\u9996\u6b21SPPM\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5149\u5b50\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6700\u7ec8\u8f90\u5c04\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u542b\u590d\u6742\u5149\u4f20\u8f93\uff08\u5982\u7126\u6563\u3001\u955c\u9762-\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cGPF\u8fbe\u5230\u5149\u5b50\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "GPF\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u5b50\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u7167\u6e32\u67d3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Khmer is a language spoken daily by over 17 million people in Cambodia, receiving little attention in the development of document AI tools. The lack of dedicated resources is particularly acute for business documents, which are critical for both public administration and private enterprise. To address this gap, we present \\textbf{KH-FUNSD}, the first publicly available, hierarchically annotated dataset for Khmer form document understanding, including receipts, invoices, and quotations. Our annotation framework features a three-level design: (1) region detection that divides each document into core zones such as header, form field, and footer; (2) FUNSD-style annotation that distinguishes questions, answers, headers, and other key entities, together with their relationships; and (3) fine-grained classification that assigns specific semantic roles, such as field labels, values, headers, footers, and symbols.

This study introduces Mirror Mode, a new game mode where the enemy AI mimics the personal strategy of a player to challenge them to keep changing their gameplay. A simplified version of the Nintendo strategy video game Fire Emblem Heroes has been built in Unity, with a Standard Mode and a Mirror Mode. Our first set of experiments find a suitable model for the task to imitate player demonstrations, using Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization. The second set of experiments evaluates the constructed model with player tests, where models are trained on demonstrations provided by participants. The gameplay of the participants indicates good imitation in defensive behavior, but not in offensive strategies. Participant's surveys indicated that they recognized their own retreating tactics, and resulted in an overall higher player-satisfaction for Mirror Mode. Refining the model further may improve imitation quality and increase player's satisfaction, especially when players face their own strategies.

However, their theoretical derivation and practical implementation are often closely coupled, which obscures the design space. To address this, we propose a common design framework for representative shortcut models. This framework provides theoretical justification for their validity and disentangles concrete component-level choices, thereby enabling systematic identification of improvements. With our proposed improvements, the resulting one-step model achieves a new state-of-the-art FID50k of 2.85 on ImageNet-256x256 under the classifier-free guidance setting. Remarkably, the model requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning.

This manuscript substantially extends that work with expanded experiments and on-device deployment analysis. Code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/Tekleab15/Automated_plant_disease_and_pest_detection_system", "summary": "Agriculture supports over 80% of the population in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, where infrastructural disruptions limit access to expert crop disease diagnosis. We present an offline-first detection system centered on a newly curated indigenous cactus-fig (Opuntia ficus-indica) dataset consisting of 3,587 field images across three core symptom classes. Given deployment constraints in post-conflict edge environments, we benchmark three mobile-efficient architectures: a custom lightweight CNN, EfficientNet-Lite1, and the CNN-Transformer hybrid MobileViT-XS. While the broader system contains independent modules for potato, apple, and corn, this study isolates cactus-fig model performance to evaluate attention sensitivity and inductive bias transfer on indigenous morphology alone. Results establish a clear Pareto trade-off: EfficientNet-Lite1 achieves 90.7% test accuracy, the lightweight CNN reaches 89.5% with the most favorable deployment profile (42 ms inference latency, 4.8 MB model size), and MobileViT-XS delivers 97.3% mean cross-validation accuracy, demonstrating that MHSA-based global reasoning disambiguates pest clusters from two dimensional fungal lesions more reliably than local texture CNN kernels.

However, deploying these models in unstructured environments remains challenging due to the critical need for simultaneous task compliance and safety assurance, particularly in preventing potential collisions during physical interactions. In this work, we introduce a Vision-Language-Safe Action (VLSA) architecture, named AEGIS, which contains a plug-and-play safety constraint (SC) layer formulated via control barrier functions. AEGIS integrates directly with existing VLA models to improve safety with theoretical guarantees, while maintaining their original instruction-following performance. To evaluate the efficacy of our architecture, we construct a comprehensive safety-critical benchmark SafeLIBERO, spanning distinct manipulation scenarios characterized by varying degrees of spatial complexity and obstacle intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, AEGIS achieves a 59.16% improvement in obstacle avoidance rate while substantially increasing the task execution success rate by 17.25%.

To address these challenges in the complex environment of roundabout intersections, this paper proposes a roundabout control algorithm, which takes into account the uncertainty of interactive information caused by time delays. First, to maintain the required distance between the current vehicle and its preceding and following vehicles, conflicting vehicles are identified based on the time-to-collision (TTC) in the conflict zone. To fully consider communication performance, a vehicle motion model incorporating time delays is established. According to the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) mechanism, the vehicle motion control that satisfies the roundabout constraints is determined. Second, by scheduling the sequence of vehicles entering the roundabout, a multiscale optimization objective is developed by integrating vehicle motion indicators and roundabout system indicators. Traffic density and travel time are embedded into the optimization problem to guide vehicles to enter the roundabout safely and stably. Through a variety of simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is verified by comparing its performance with that of multiple control algorithms under different autonomous vehicle penetration rates and heavy traffic load scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\u5ef6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u73af\u5f62\u8def\u53e3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u81f3\u78b0\u649e\uff08TTC\uff09\u51b2\u7a81\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u542b\u65f6\u5ef6\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8f66\u6d41\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "CAVs\u5728\u73af\u5f62\u8def\u53e3\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u3001\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u751a\u81f3\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eTTC\u8bc6\u522b\u51b2\u7a81\u8f66\u8f86\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u542b\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\u5ef6\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08DMPC\uff09\u6ee1\u8db3\u73af\u5f62\u8def\u53e3\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b4\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u884c\u7a0b\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8c03\u5ea6\u8f66\u8f86\u8fdb\u5165\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u4eff\u771f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u4e0e\u91cd\u8f7d\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u901a\u884c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u73af\u5f62\u8def\u53e3\u4e2d\u7531\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u534f\u540c\u901a\u884c\u3002"}}

Traditional keyword-based search systems provide limited semantic understanding, while existing AI-driven tools typically focus on isolated tasks such as retrieval, clustering, or bibliometric visualization. This paper presents an integrated system for scientific literature exploration that combines large-scale data acquisition, hybrid retrieval, semantic topic modeling, and heterogeneous knowledge graph construction. The system builds a comprehensive corpus by merging full-text data from arXiv with structured metadata from OpenAlex. A hybrid retrieval architecture fuses BM25 lexical search with embedding-based semantic search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Topic modeling is performed on retrieved results using BERTopic or non-negative matrix factorization depending on computational resources. A knowledge graph unifies papers, authors, institutions, countries, and extracted topics into an interpretable structure.

Previous methods mostly leverage the vanilla Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) objective to distill motion from pretrained text-to-video diffusion, leading to animations with minimal movement or noticeable jitter. To address this, our approach introduces a novel SDS alternative, Motion Score Distillation (MSD). Specifically, we introduce a LoRA-enhanced video diffusion model that defines a static source distribution rather than pure noise as in SDS, while another inversion-based noise estimation technique ensures appearance preservation when guiding motion. To further improve motion fidelity, we incorporate explicit temporal and spatial regularization terms that mitigate geometric distortions across time and space. Additionally, we propose a motion refinement module to upscale the temporal resolution and enhance fine-grained details, overcoming the fixed-resolution constraints of the underlying video model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Animus3D successfully animates static 3D assets from diverse text prompts, generating significantly more substantial and detailed motion than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining high visual integrity.

Calibration seeks to achieve this by improving the alignment between the model's confidence and the actual likelihood of its responses being correct or desirable. However, it has been observed that the internal confidence of a model, derived from token probabilities, is not well aligned with its verbalized confidence, leading to misleading results with different calibration methods. In this paper, we propose Direct Confidence Alignment (DCA), a method using Direct Preference Optimization to align an LLM's verbalized confidence with its internal confidence rather than ground-truth accuracy, enhancing model transparency and reliability by ensuring closer alignment between the two confidence measures. We evaluate DCA across multiple open-weight LLMs on a wide range of datasets. To further assess this alignment, we also introduce three new calibration error-based metrics. Our results show that DCA improves alignment metrics on certain model architectures, reducing inconsistencies in a model's confidence expression. However, we also show that it can be ineffective on others, highlighting the need for more model-aware approaches in the pursuit of more interpretable and trustworthy LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDirect Confidence Alignment (DCA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53e3\u5934\u5316\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u7c7b\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u6982\u7387\uff09\u4e0e\u5176\u53e3\u5934\u5316\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u4e8c\u8005\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDirect Confidence Alignment (DCA)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Direct Preference Optimization\uff08DPO\uff09\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u53e3\u5934\u5316\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "DCA\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u53e3\u5934\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u53e3\u5934\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u662f\u63d0\u5347LLM\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dDCA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9002\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dependencies (e.g., selecting fact A requires fact B), categorical quotas (e.g., select at most one writing style), and hierarchical rules (e.g., select at most two social media preferences, of which at most one can be for a professional network). These constraints violate the assumptions of standard subset selection algorithms. We propose a principled method to formally model such constraints. We introduce a compilation process that transforms a user's knowledge graph with dependencies into a set of abstract macro-facets. Our central result is a proof that common hierarchical and quota-based constraints over these macro-facets form a valid laminar matroid. This theoretical characterization lets us cast structured personalization as submodular maximization under a matroid constraint, enabling greedy with constant-factor guarantees (and (1-1/e) via continuous greedy) for a much richer and more realistic class of problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u903b\u8f91\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u914d\u989d\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u89c4\u5219\uff09\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u5b8f\u89c2\u9762\uff08macro-facets\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u7ea6\u675f\u6784\u6210\u5c42\u72b6\u62df\u9635\uff08laminar matroid\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u6a21\u51fd\u6570\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u6743\u8861\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u62ab\u9732\uff1b\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u5b8f\u89c2\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0e\u914d\u989d\u7c7b\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9762\u4e0a\u6784\u6210\u5c42\u72b6\u62df\u9635\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5b50\u6a21\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u62df\u9635\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5e38\u89c1\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u5f62\u6210\u5c42\u72b6\u62df\u9635\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff08\u8fde\u7eed\u8d2a\u5fc3\u53ef\u8fbe1-1/e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5b50\u6a21\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Do"], "title": "SPAR: Session-based Pipeline for Adaptive Retrieval on Legacy File Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "The ability to extract value from historical data is essential for enterprise decision-making. However, much of this information remains inaccessible within large legacy file systems that lack structured organization and semantic indexing, making retrieval and analysis inefficient and error-prone. We introduce SPAR (Session-based Pipeline for Adaptive Retrieval), a conceptual framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture specifically designed for legacy enterprise environments. Unlike conventional RAG pipelines, which require costly construction and maintenance of full-scale vector databases that mirror the entire file system, SPAR employs a lightweight two-stage process: a semantic Metadata Index is first created, after which session-specific vector databases are dynamically generated on demand. This design reduces computational overhead while improving transparency, controllability, and relevance in retrieval. We provide a theoretical complexity analysis comparing SPAR with standard LLM-based RAG pipelines, demonstrating its computational advantages. To validate the framework, we apply SPAR to a synthesized enterprise-scale file system containing a large corpus of biomedical literature, showing improvements in both retrieval effectiveness and downstream model accuracy.

While current techniques like Fourier encodings have made great strides in improving performance, there remains scope for improvement when presented with high-frequency information. This paper introduces Queried-Convolutions (Qonvolutions), a simple yet powerful modification using the neighborhood properties of convolution. Qonvolution convolves a low-frequency signal with queries (such as coordinates) to enhance the learning of intricate high-frequency signals. We empirically demonstrate that Qonvolutions enhance performance across a variety of high-frequency learning tasks crucial to both the computer vision and graphics communities, including 1D regression, 2D super-resolution, 2D image regression, and novel view synthesis (NVS). In particular, by combining Gaussian splatting with Qonvolutions for NVS, we showcase state-of-the-art performance on real-world complex scenes, even outperforming powerful radiance field models on image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aQonvolutions\uff08\u67e5\u8be2\u5377\u79ef\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5377\u79ef\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\uff08\u5982\u5750\u6807\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u57281D\u56de\u5f52\u30012D\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u56e0\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQonvolutions\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5377\u79ef\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u57281D\u56de\u5f52\u30012D\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u30012D\u56fe\u50cf\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff08NVS\uff09\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728NVS\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684SOTA\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Qonvolutions\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cdKV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982GSM8K\u3001MATH500\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0H2O\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7248SnapKV\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u91cd\u51fb\u8005\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9488\u5bf9prefill\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u957f\u89e3\u7801\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u800c\u590d\u6742\u77ed\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u6570\u5343token\u7684\u601d\u8003\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9002\u914d\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982GSM8K\u3001MATH500\uff09\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e3b\u6d41KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982H2O\u3001SnapKV\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1SnapKV\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u542f\u7528\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "H2O\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u589e\u5f3a\u7248SnapKV\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u4f4e\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u90e8\u5206\u7b56\u7565\u53cd\u800c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u5411\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u9700\u91cd\u89c6\u91cd\u51fb\u8005\u52a8\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u9002\u914d\uff1b\u7f13\u5b58\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6/\u6210\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e94\u4f9d\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

(Q3) Do they have distinct reasoning signatures?\n  We answer these by evaluating 20+ LLMs on eleven semantically meaningful causal tasks formalized by a collider graph ($C_1\\!\\to\\!E\\!\\leftarrow\\!C_2$ ) under \\emph{Direct} (one-shot number as response = probability judgment of query node being one and \\emph{Chain of Thought} (CoT; think first, then provide answer).\n  Judgments are modeled with a leaky noisy-OR causal Bayes net (CBN) whose parameters $\u03b8=(b,m_1,m_2,p(C)) \\in [0,1]$ include a shared prior $p(C)$;\n  we select the winning model via AIC between a 3-parameter symmetric causal strength ($m_1{=}m_2$) and 4-parameter asymmetric ($m_1{\\neq}m_2$) variant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u572811\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f3020\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u4e8c\u8005\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6f0f\u566a-OR\u56e0\u679c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u5224\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9LLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u56e0\u679c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u9700\u5398\u6e05\u4e8c\u8005\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u662f\u5426\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u72ec\u7279\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8ecollider\u56fe\uff08C\u2081\u2192E\u2190C\u2082\uff09\u768411\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5Direct\uff08\u5355\u6b21\u6570\u503c\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u548cChain of Thought\uff08CoT\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f3020+\u4e2aLLM\uff1b\u7528\u542b\u53c2\u6570\u03b8=(b,m\u2081,m\u2082,p(C))\u7684leaky noisy-OR\u56e0\u679c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AIC\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u79f0\uff08m\u2081=m\u2082\uff09\u6216\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\uff08m\u2081\u2260m\u2082\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff1b\u4e14\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b7e\u540d\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8cp(C)\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5f3a\u5ea6m\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5c1a\u672a\u771f\u6b63\u638c\u63e1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5185\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This work presents a comprehensive comparison between SAM3 (Segment Anything Model, also called SAMv3) operating in zero-shot mode and three variants of Ultralytics YOLO11 (nano, medium, and large) fine-tuned for instance segmentation. The evaluation is conducted on the MinneApple dataset, a dense benchmark comprising 670 orchard images with 28,179 annotated apple instances, enabling rigorous validation of model behavior under high object density and occlusion. Our analysis shows IoU choices can inflate performance gaps by up to 30%. At the appropriate IoU = 0.15 threshold, YOLO models achieve 68.9%, 72.2%, and 71.9% F1, while SAM3 reaches 59.8% in pure zero-shot mode. However, YOLO exhibits steep degradation 48-50 points across IoU ranges whereas SAM3 drops only 4 points, revealing 12 times superior boundary stability of SAM3. This highlights the strength of SAMv3 in mask precision versus specialization in detection completeness of YOLO11. We provide open-source code, evaluation pipelines, and methodological recommendations, contributing to a deeper understanding of when specialized fine-tuned models or generalist foundation models are preferable for dense instance segmentation tasks.

In this paper we introduce Aion, a framework that embeds temporal flow dynamics directly within a hierarchical 3DSG, effectively incorporating the temporal dimension. Aion employs a graph-based sparse MoD representation to capture motion flows over arbitrary time intervals and attaches them to navigational nodes in the scene graph, yielding more interpretable and scalable predictions that improve planning and interaction in complex dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u5c423D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff083DSG\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\uff08MoD\uff09\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u5185\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd0\u52a8\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5173\u8054\u5230\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff083DSG\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\uff08MoD\uff09\u53c8\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u7f3a\u5931\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684Maps of Dynamics\uff08MoD\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u5c423D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u8fd0\u52a8\u6d41\u76f4\u63a5\u9644\u7740\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u4eba\u673a/\u7269\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Aion\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e863DSG\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0eMoD\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5f8b\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Specifically, to handle behavior heterogeneity, we introduce a dual item-behavior fusion architecture that incorporates behavior information at both the input and intermediate levels, enabling preference modeling from multiple perspectives. To mitigate data sparsity, we design three behavior-level data augmentation methods that operate directly on behavior sequences rather than core item sequences.

Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

However, assessing their accuracy and reliability remains a challenge. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside advanced prompting techniques and agent-based methods to evaluate the extent to which ConvQA system responses adhere to user utterances. The focus lies on contextual understanding and the ability to provide accurate venue recommendations considering user constraints and situational context. To evaluate utterance-response coherence using an LLM, we synthetically generate user utterances accompanied by correct and modified failure-containing system responses. We use input-output, chain-of-thought, self-consistency prompting, and multi-agent prompting techniques with 13 reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs of varying sizes and providers, including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, and Meta. We evaluate our approach on a case study involving restaurant recommendations. The most substantial improvements occur for small non-reasoning models when applying advanced prompting techniques, particularly multi-agent prompting. However, reasoning models consistently outperform non-reasoning models, with the best performance achieved using single-agent prompting with self-consistency. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 reaches an F1-score of 0.99 at a cost of 0.002 USD per request. Overall, the best balance between effectiveness and cost-time efficiency is reached with the non-reasoning model DeepSeek-V3.

We find that autoregressive language models, from token prediction to sequence-to-sequence tasks, are remarkably resilient (for GPT-2, test NLL increases modestly from 2.87 to 3.59 despite 50% token corruption). By contrast, under the same levels of data corruption, class-conditional diffusion models degrade catastrophically (image-label consistency plummets by 56.81% relative to baseline), while classifiers show a moderate impact that diminishes with dataset scale. To explain these discrepancies, we analyze the results through a multi-perspective lens, integrating information theory, PAC learning, and gradient dynamics.

In this work, we propose an effective hybrid approach that combines physics-based modeling with data-driven learning to enhance state estimation and further prediction. Our method builds upon the Parameterized Background Data-Weak (PBDW) framework, which naturally integrates a reduced-order representation of the best-available model with measurement data to account for both anticipated and unanticipated uncertainties. To address model discrepancies not captured by the reduced-order space, and learn the structure of model deviation, we incorporate a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) constrained to be an orthogonal complement of the best-knowledge manifold.

However, mmWave signals are inherently complex, sparse, and high-dimensional, making physical simulation computationally expensive. This paper presents mmWeaver, a novel framework that synthesizes realistic, environment-specific complex mmWave signals by modeling them as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), achieving up to 49-fold compression. mmWeaver incorporates hypernetworks that dynamically generate INR parameters based on environmental context (extracted from RGB-D images) and human motion features (derived from text-to-pose generation via MotionGPT), enabling efficient and adaptive signal synthesis. By conditioning on these semantic and geometric priors, mmWeaver generates diverse I/Q signals at multiple resolutions, preserving phase information critical for downstream tasks such as point cloud estimation and activity classification. Extensive experiments show that mmWeaver achieves a complex SSIM of 0.88 and a PSNR of 35 dB, outperforming existing methods in signal realism while improving activity recognition accuracy by up to 7% and reducing human pose estimation error by up to 15%, all while operating 6-35 times faster than simulation-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "mmWeaver\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u548c\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u590d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u52a0\u901f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u9ad8\u7ef4\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u903c\u771f\u3001\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fammWeaver\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u5c06\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5RGB-D\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u73af\u5883\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u548cMotionGPT\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210INR\u53c2\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387I/Q\u4fe1\u53f7\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff08complex SSIM\uff09\u8fbe0.88\uff0cPSNR\u8fbe35 dB\uff1b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad87%\uff0c\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u9ad815%\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb6\u201335\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "mmWeaver\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684INR\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3001\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Recent advances in learning-based control have shown great potential in enabling robots to acquire and generalize complex manipulation skills in such environments, but ensuring safety, both during exploration and execution, remains a critical bottleneck for reliable real-world deployment. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of safe learning-based methods for robot contact-rich tasks. We categorize existing approaches into two main domains: safe exploration and safe execution. We review key techniques, including constrained reinforcement learning, risk-sensitive optimization, uncertainty-aware modeling, control barrier functions, and model predictive safety shields, and highlight how these methods incorporate prior knowledge, task structure, and online adaptation to balance safety and efficiency. A particular emphasis of this survey is on how these safe learning principles extend to and interact with emerging robotic foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action models (VLAs), which unify perception, language, and control for contact-rich manipulation. We discuss both the new safety opportunities enabled by VLM/VLA-based methods, such as language-level specification of constraints and multimodal grounding of safety signals, and the amplified risks and evaluation challenges they introduce. Finally, we outline current limitations and promising future directions toward deploying reliable, safety-aligned, and foundation-model-enabled robots in complex contact-rich environments.

Traditionally, user reviews have served as a critical source of rich, contextual information for enhancing recommendation quality. However, as LLMs demonstrate an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human-like text, this raises the question of whether explicit user reviews remain essential in the era of LLMs. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation of the evolving role of text reviews in recommendation by comparing deep learning methods and LLM approaches. Particularly, we conduct extensive experiments on eight public datasets with LLMs and evaluate their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. We further introduce a benchmarking evaluation framework for review-aware recommender systems, RAREval, to comprehensively assess the contribution of textual reviews to the recommendation performance of review-aware recommender systems. Our framework examines various scenarios, including the removal of some or all textual reviews, random distortion, as well as recommendation performance in data sparsity and cold-start user settings. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of functioning as effective review-aware recommendation engines, generally outperforming traditional deep learning approaches, particularly in scenarios characterized by data sparsity and cold-start conditions. In addition, the removal of some or all textual reviews and random distortion does not necessarily lead to declines in recommendation accuracy. These findings motivate a rethinking of how user preference from text reviews can be more effectively leveraged.

These assets are then used in a game engine where physics simulations create natural arrangements. A novel, two-pass rendering technique combines the realism of splats with a shadow map generated from proxy meshes. This map is then algorithmically composited with the image to add both physically plausible shadows and subtle highlights, significantly enhancing realism. Pixel-perfect segmentation masks are generated automatically and formatted for direct use with object detection models like YOLO.

During the autoregressive decoding process, KV caches consume substantial GPU memory, limiting batch sizes and overall system throughput. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{CXL-SpecKV}, a novel disaggregated KV-cache architecture that leverages Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnects and FPGA accelerators to enable efficient speculative execution and memory disaggregation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (i) a CXL-based memory disaggregation framework that offloads KV-caches to remote FPGA memory with low latency, (ii) a speculative KV-cache prefetching mechanism that predicts and preloads future tokens' cache entries, and (iii) an FPGA-accelerated KV-cache compression and decompression engine that reduces memory bandwidth requirements by up to 4$\\times$. When evaluated on state-of-the-art LLM models, CXL-SpecKV achieves up to 3.2$\\times$ higher throughput compared to GPU-only baselines, while reducing memory costs by 2.8$\\times$ and maintaining accuracy.

This paper presents an efficient fine-tuning methodology and real-world deployment analysis for adapting VLA models to low-cost robotic manipulation systems.We propose a resource-efficient fine-tuning strategy using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and quantization techniques that enable multi-billion parameter VLA models ( 3.1B parameters) to run on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB VRAM. Our methodology addresses the critical challenge of adapting pre-trained VLA models to new robot embodiments with limited demonstration data, focusing on the trade-offs between frozen and unfrozen vision encoders. Through real-world deployment on the SO101 robotic arm for a button-pressing manipulation task, we demonstrate that our approach achieves effective manipulation performance while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide detailed analysis of deployment challenges, failure modes, and the relationship between training data quantity and real-world performance,trained on 200 demonstration episodes.

Current benchmarks, however, evaluate VSS primarily on the recall-latency trade-off against a ground truth defined solely by distance metrics, neglecting how retrieval quality ultimately impacts downstream tasks. This disconnect can mislead both academic research and industrial practice.\n  We present Iceberg, a holistic benchmark suite for end-to-end evaluation of VSS methods in realistic application contexts. From a task-centric view, Iceberg uncovers the Information Loss Funnel, which identifies three principal sources of end-to-end performance degradation: (1) Embedding Loss during feature extraction; (2) Metric Misuse, where distances poorly reflect task relevance; (3) Data Distribution Sensitivity, highlighting index robustness across skews and modalities. For a more comprehensive assessment, Iceberg spans eight diverse datasets across key domains such as image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and recommendation systems. Each dataset, ranging from 1M to 100M vectors, includes rich, task-specific labels and evaluation metrics, enabling assessment of retrieval algorithms within the full application pipeline rather than in isolation. Iceberg benchmarks 13 state-of-the-art VSS methods and re-ranks them based on application-level metrics, revealing substantial deviations from traditional rankings derived purely from recall-latency evaluations. Building on these insights, we define a set of task-centric meta-features and derive an interpretable decision tree to guide practitioners in selecting and tuning VSS methods for their specific workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Iceberg\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\uff08VSS\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6392\u5e8f13\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41VSS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u8df5\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VSS\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387-\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8131\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIceberg\u57fa\u51c6\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u6f0f\u6597\u2019\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5d4c\u5165\u635f\u5931\u3001\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bef\u7528\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e09\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u6e90\uff1b\u57288\u4e2a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u3001\u5e26\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf913\u79cdSOTA VSS\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684VSS\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7684VSS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e09\u5927\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u6e90\u5bf9\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8986\u76d61M\u2013100M\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u914d\u5957\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "VSS\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc5\u987b\u4ece\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u8f6c\u5411\u9762\u5411\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\uff1bIceberg\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we introduce BLASST, a drop-in sparse attention method that dynamically prunes the attention matrix without any pre-computation or proxy scores. Our method uses a fixed threshold and existing information from online softmax to identify negligible attention scores, skipping softmax computation, Value block loading, and the subsequent matrix multiplication. This fits seamlessly into existing FlashAttention kernel designs with negligible latency overhead. The approach is applicable to both prefill and decode stages across all attention variants (MHA, GQA, MQA, and MLA), providing a unified solution for accelerating long-context inference. We develop an automated calibration procedure that reveals a simple inverse relationship between optimal threshold and context length, enabling robust deployment across diverse scenarios. Maintaining high accuracy, we demonstrate a 1.62x speedup for prefill at 74.7% sparsity and a 1.48x speedup for decode at 73.2% sparsity on modern GPUs. Furthermore, we explore sparsity-aware training as a natural extension, showing that models can be trained to be inherently more robust to sparse attention patterns, pushing the accuracy-sparsity frontier even further.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBLASST\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u526a\u679d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebfsoftmax\u4fe1\u606f\u8df3\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "BLASST\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u548c\u5728\u7ebfsoftmax\u5df2\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8df3\u8fc7\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7701\u53bbsoftmax\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001Value\u5757\u52a0\u8f7d\u53ca\u540e\u7eed\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\uff1b\u9002\u914dFlashAttention\uff0c\u652f\u6301prefill/decode\u53caMHA/GQA/MQA/MLA\u7b49\u6240\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6821\u51c6\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u9608\u503c\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u5448\u7b80\u5355\u53cd\u6bd4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0prefill\u9636\u6bb574.7%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b1.62\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3001decode\u9636\u6bb573.2%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b1.48\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u62d3\u5c55\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "BLASST\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Here we introduce AGAPI (AtomGPT.org API), an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates more than eight open-source LLMs with over twenty materials-science API endpoints, unifying databases, simulation tools, and machine-learning models through a common orchestration framework. AGAPI employs an Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture that autonomously constructs and executes multi-step workflows spanning materials data retrieval, graph neural network property prediction, machine-learning force-field optimization, tight-binding calculations, diffraction analysis, and inverse design. We demonstrate AGAPI through end-to-end workflows, including heterostructure construction, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, and semiconductor defect engineering requiring up to ten sequential operations. In addition, we evaluate AGAPI using 30+ example prompts as test cases and compare agentic predictions with and without tool access against experimental data.

This paper argues that DPO does not rewrite a models internal beliefs; instead, it acts as a low rank steering mechanism that nudges activations along a small number of preference directions. Using a simple derivation, we show that the DPO gradient depends only on the difference between the logit embeddings of preferred and dispreferred completions, implying a first order shift in the final hidden representation rather than a deep restructuring of semantics. We then extract an empirical steering vector from a DPO tuned model and demonstrate that adding this vector to base activations reproduces most of the aligned behavior, while subtracting it nearly restores the original model. Finally, spectral analyses reveal rank-one dominance and entropy collapse in upper layers, indicating that alignment is funneled through a narrow subspace. Taken together, these results support a behavioral illusion view of DPO: it teaches models how to act aligned, not what to believe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDPO\u5e76\u975e\u91cd\u5199\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u9636\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u6784\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u590d\u73b0\u6216\u64a4\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u5c42\u5448\u73b0\u79e9\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e0e\u71b5\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50\u88ab\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u72ed\u7a84\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301DPO\u4ec5\u5851\u9020\u2018\u5982\u4f55\u884c\u52a8\u2019\u800c\u975e\u2018\u76f8\u4fe1\u4ec0\u4e48\u2019\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5e7b\u89c9\u89c2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1DPO\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u9645\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bc1\u660eDPO\u68af\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u975e\u504f\u597d\u8865\u5168\u7684logit\u5d4c\u5165\u5dee\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u53d6\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u52a0\u51cf\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5f00\u5c55\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u68c0\u9a8c\u9ad8\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u79e9\u4e0e\u71b5\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "DPO\u68af\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u6700\u7ec8\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u504f\u79fb\uff1b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\u80fd\u590d\u73b0\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u9ad8\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u5448\u73b0\u79e9\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u71b5\u574d\u7f29\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "DPO\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u79e9\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5236\u9020\u7684\u662f\u2018\u884c\u4e3a\u5e7b\u89c9\u2019\u2014\u2014\u6559\u4f1a\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u5185\u5728\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002"}}

Traditional roadside video collection often fails in dense mixed traffic due to occlusion, limited viewing angles, and irregular vehicle movements. UAV-based recording provides a top-down perspective that reduces these issues and captures rich spatial and temporal dynamics. The datasets described here were extracted using the Data from Sky (DFS) platform and validated against manual counts, space mean speeds, and probe trajectories in earlier work. Each dataset contains time-stamped vehicle positions, speeds, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and vehicle classifications at a resolution of 30 frames per second. Data were collected at six mid-block locations in the national capital region of India, covering diverse traffic compositions and density levels. Exploratory analyses highlight key behavioural patterns, including lane-keeping preferences, speed distributions, and lateral manoeuvres typical of heterogeneous and area-based traffic settings. These datasets are intended as a resource for the global research community to support simulation modelling, safety assessment, and behavioural studies under area-based traffic conditions.

To resolve this impasse, we conduct a comprehensive review of learning-based motion planning methods. Based on this review, we outline a data-driven optimal control paradigm as a unifying framework that synergistically integrates the verifiable structure of classical control with the adaptive capacity of machine learning, leveraging real-world data to continuously refine key components such as system dynamics, cost functions, and safety constraints. We explore this framework's potential to enable three critical next-generation capabilities: \"Human-Centric\" customization, \"Platform-Adaptive\" dynamics adaptation, and \"System Self-Optimization\" via self-tuning.

However, real-world applications often face situations where no training data is available, such as when launching new services or handling entirely new users. In such cases, conventional approaches cannot be applied. This study focuses on training-free recommendation, where no task-specific training is performed, and particularly on \\textit{training-free cold-start recommendation} (TFCSR), the more challenging case where the target user has no interactions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been explored as a promising solution, and numerous studies have been proposed. As the ability of text embedding models (TEMs) increases, they are increasingly recognized as applicable to training-free recommendation, but no prior work has directly compared LLMs and TEMs under identical conditions. We present the first controlled experiments that systematically evaluate these two approaches in the same setting. The results show that TEMs outperform LLM rerankers, and this trend holds not only in cold-start settings but also in warm-start settings with rich interactions. These findings indicate that direct LLM ranking is not the only viable option, contrary to the commonly shared belief, and TEM-based approaches provide a stronger and more scalable basis for training-free recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff08TEM\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eTEM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u2018LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u2019\u7684\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u65e0\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u6216\u65b0\u670d\u52a1\uff08\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u867d\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4fLLM\u4e0e\u65b0\u5174TEM\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u9996\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83LLM\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u4e0eTEM\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u63a8\u8350\uff08TFCSR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u4e0e\u6696\u542f\u52a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "TEM\u5728\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6696\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u6210\u7acb\u3002", "conclusion": "TEM\u4e3a\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4LLM\u66f4\u4f18\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u5065\u4e14\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u7ffb\u4e86LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process. Our model can generate multi-modal preview representations that include RGB and scene intrinsics at more than 4$\\times$ real-time speed (less than 1 second for a 4-second video) that convey consistent appearance and motion to the final video. With the trained decoder, we show that it is possible to interactively guide the generation at intermediate noise steps via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, unlocking a new control capability. Moreover, we systematically probe the model using the learned decoders, revealing how scene, object, and other details are composed and assembled during the otherwise black-box denoising process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DiffusionBrowser\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u6216Transformer\u5757\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u89c8\uff08\u5982RGB\u548c\u573a\u666f\u672c\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5b9e\u65f6\uff084\u500d\uff09\u9884\u89c8\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6027\u91cd\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u573a\u666f\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e86\u89e3\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffusionBrowser\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff08\u4efb\u610ftimestep\u6216transformer block\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u89c8\uff08RGB + \u573a\u666f\u672c\u5f81\uff09\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\u91cd\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u5728<1\u79d2\u5185\u751f\u62104\u79d2\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u89c8\uff08>4\u00d7\u5b9e\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u9884\u89c8\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u95f4\u566a\u58f0\u6b65\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u7b49\u7ec6\u8282\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7ec4\u5408\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffusionBrowser\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context.

While typical game-theoretic assumptions often overlook such heterogeneity, hypergame theory provides the mathematical framework to reason about mismatched mental models. Although hypergames have recently gained traction in dynamic applications concerning uncertainty, their practical adoption in multi-agent system research has been hindered by the lack of a unifying, formal, and practical representation language, as well as scalable algorithms for managing complex hypergame structures and equilibria. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a declarative, logic-based domain-specific language for encoding hypergame structures and hypergame solution concepts. Leveraging answer-set programming, we develop an automated pipeline for instantiating hypergame structures and running our novel hypergame rationalisation procedure, a mechanism for finding belief structures that justify seemingly irrational outcomes. The proposed language establishes a unifying formalism for hypergames and serves as a foundation for developing nuanced, belief-based heterogeneous reasoners, offering a verifiable context with logical guarantees.

Project homepage: https://duowuyms.github.io/trailblazer", "summary": "Designing control policies to ensure robust network services is essential to modern digital infrastructure. However, the dominant paradigm for network optimization relies on designing specialist policies based on handcrafted rules or deep learning models, leading to poor generalization across diverse tasks and environments. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on Internet-scale corpora, provide a rich and unified knowledge base that encodes fundamental networking principles. Combined with their emergent abilities in generalization to unseen scenarios, LLMs offer a transformative foundation for generalist network policies that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments with minimal adaptation. In this paper, we present Trailblazer, the first systematic framework to realize such a generalist policy for networking. Trailblazer incorporates a network alignment scheme to ground the LLM in specific networking tasks, and an adaptive policy collaboration mechanism that offloads simple control cases from the LLM to a lightweight policy for computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations and large-scale real-world online evaluation on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Trailblazer, powered by a single LLM, demonstrates stronger cross-task and cross-environment generalization than conventional specialist policies. Our results validate LLMs as the foundation for generalist network policies, and position Trailblazer as the first step toward the generalist-driven paradigm that enables strong generalization with minimal efforts in policy design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTrailblazer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e13\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u800c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8e\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8bed\u6599\u7684LLM\u5177\u5907\u7f51\u7edc\u539f\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u652f\u6491\u901a\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrailblazer\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u9002\u914d\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u7f51\u7edc\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u7b80\u5355\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\u7ed9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u6296\u97f3\uff08Douyin\uff09\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ebf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u4e2aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Trailblazer\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u4e13\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0cTrailblazer\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u5411\u2018\u901a\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u2019\u7f51\u7edc\u7b56\u7565\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002"}}

A Unified Benchmark for Typographic-Attack Robustness and Text Recognition in Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading text within an image overrides visual understanding. Existing evaluation protocols and defenses, largely focused on object recognition, implicitly encourage ignoring text to achieve robustness; however, real-world scenarios often require joint reasoning over both objects and text (e.g., recognizing pedestrians while reading traffic signs). To address this, we introduce a novel task, Read-or-Ignore VQA (RIO-VQA), which formalizes selective text use in visual question answering (VQA): models must decide, from context, when to read text and when to ignore it. For evaluation, we present the Read-or-Ignore Benchmark (RIO-Bench), a standardized dataset and protocol that, for each real image, provides same-scene counterfactuals (read / ignore) by varying only the textual content and question type. Using RIO-Bench, we show that strong LVLMs and existing defenses fail to balance typographic robustness and text-reading capability, highlighting the need for improved approaches. Finally, RIO-Bench enables a novel data-driven defense that learns adaptive selective text use, moving beyond prior non-adaptive, text-ignoring defenses. Overall, this work reveals a fundamental misalignment between the existing evaluation scope and real-world requirements, providing a principled path toward reliable LVLMs. Our Project Page is at https://turingmotors.github.io/rio-vqa/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRead-or-Ignore VQA\uff08RIO-VQA\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0eRIO-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u6587\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u8bfb\u53d6\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u6587\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u95f4\u7684\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LVLM\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9690\u542b\u9f13\u52b1\u5ffd\u7565\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5e38\u9700\u56fe\u6587\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u8bc6\u522b\u4eba\u884c\u9053\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u56f4\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRIO-VQA\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u8bfb\u53d6\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\uff1b\u6784\u5efaRIO-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ec5\u6587\u672c/\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u540c\u573a\u666f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\uff08read/ignore\u5bf9\uff09\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u5f3aLVLM\u53ca\u4e3b\u6d41\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u6297\u5b57\u5f62\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5fc5\u8981\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff1bRIO-Bench\u6210\u529f\u652f\u6491\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u5ffd\u7565\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b0\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LVLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RIO-VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0eRIO-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684LVLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

During inference, DLMs generate text by iteratively denoising masked sequences in parallel; however, determining which positions to unmask and which tokens to commit forms a large combinatorial search problem. Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search at the initialization stage to explore promising unmasking trajectories, providing a robust starting point for subsequent refinement. This integration is enabled by restricting the search space to high-confidence actions and prioritizing token choices that improve model confidence over remaining masked positions. Across multiple benchmarks, MEDAL achieves up to 22.0% improvement over existing inference strategies, establishing a new paradigm for search-based inference in diffusion language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMEDAL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DLM\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5e76\u884c\u53bb\u566a\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u4e0etoken\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMEDAL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u5f15\u5165DLM\u63a8\u7406\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5269\u4f59\u63a9\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684token\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cMEDAL\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534722.0%\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MEDAL\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u3001\u539f\u7406\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Given a supervised dataset, CLARGA can be applied to virtually any machine learning task to fuse different multimodal representations for processing by downstream layers. On a sample-by-sample basis, CLARGA learns how modalities should inform one another by building an attention weighted graph over their features and passing messages along this graph with a multi-head Graph Attention Network. Not only does this make CLARGA highly adaptive, as it constructs unique graphs for different samples, it makes for efficient fusion with sub-quadratic complexity as the number of modalities grows. Through a learnable mask, it can also adapt to missing modality inputs. The model is trained with a hybrid objective that combines a supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss, improving cross-modal consistency and robustness to noisy inputs. We demonstrate CLARGA's effectiveness in diverse multimodal representation learning tasks across 7 datasets spanning finance, human-computer interaction, general multimedia classification, and affective computing. It consistently outperforms baselines, state-of-the-art models, and ablations. Additional experiments also demonstrate its robustness to missing inputs and ability to excel on niche tasks.

The potential existence of valuable resources at the lunar South Pole has made landing in that region a high priority for many space agencies and commercial companies. However, relying on a LiDAR for hazard detection during descent is risky, as this technology is fairly untested in the lunar environment.\n  There exists a rich log of lunar surface data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which could be used to create informative prior maps of the surface before descent. In this work, we propose a method for generating stochastic elevation maps from LRO data using Gaussian processes (GPs), which are a powerful Bayesian framework for non-parametric modeling that produce accompanying uncertainty estimates. In high-risk environments such as autonomous spaceflight, interpretable estimates of terrain uncertainty are critical. However, no previous approaches to stochastic elevation mapping have taken LRO Digital Elevation Model (DEM) confidence maps into account, despite this data containing key information about the quality of the DEM in different areas.\n  To address this gap, we introduce a two-stage GP model in which a secondary GP learns spatially varying noise characteristics from DEM confidence data. This heteroscedastic information is then used to inform the noise parameters for the primary GP, which models the lunar terrain. Additionally, we use stochastic variational GPs to enable scalable training. By leveraging GPs, we are able to more accurately model the impact of heteroscedastic sensor noise on the resulting elevation map. As a result, our method produces more informative terrain uncertainty, which can be used for downstream tasks such as hazard detection and safe landing site selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08GP\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u968f\u673a\u9ad8\u7a0b\u5730\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6708\u7403\u52d8\u6d4b\u8f68\u9053\u98de\u884c\u5668\uff08LRO\uff09\u6570\u636e\u53caDEM\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6708\u7403\u5357\u6781\u7740\u9646\u533a\u57df\u5730\u5f62\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6708\u7403\u5357\u6781\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u5dee\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u907f\u969c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1bLiDAR\u5728\u6708\u9762\u73af\u5883\u672a\u7ecf\u5145\u5206\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1bLRO\u79ef\u7d2f\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u8868\u9762\u6570\u636e\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u5e26\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5730\u5f62\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565DEM\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e2d\u8574\u542b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u566a\u58f0\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u6b21\u7ea7GP\u4eceDEM\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5373\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u8be5\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u4e3bGP\u5bf9\u6708\u8868\u9ad8\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5206GP\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7a0b\u56fe\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u5730\u5f62\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u5371\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7740\u9646\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408LRO DEM\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5GP\u5efa\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6708\u9762\u968f\u673a\u9ad8\u7a0b\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u81ea\u4e3b\u822a\u5929\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Its core relies on a coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture that enables rapid candidate selection and precise semantic matching, achieving millisecond-level response over billion-scale corpora. This capability makes it essential not only in traditional search and recommendation scenarios but also in the emerging paradigm of generative recommendation driven by large language models, where semantic IDs-themselves a form of coarse-to-fine representation-play a foundational role. However, the widely adopted dual-tower encoding architecture introduces inherent challenges, primarily representational space misalignment and retrieval index inconsistency, which degrade matching accuracy, retrieval stability, and performance on long-tail queries. These issues are further magnified in semantic ID generation, ultimately limiting the performance ceiling of downstream generative models.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a simple and effective framework named SCI comprising two synergistic modules: a symmetric representation alignment module that employs an innovative input-swapping mechanism to unify the dual-tower representation space without adding parameters, and an consistent indexing with dual-tower synergy module that redesigns retrieval paths using a dual-view indexing strategy to maintain consistency from training to inference. The framework is systematic, lightweight, and engineering-friendly, requiring minimal overhead while fully supporting billion-scale deployment.

From a mathematical perspective, a semantic distance can be viewed as a metric defined on a space of texts or on a representation space derived from them. However, most classical semantic distance methods are essentially fixed, making them difficult to adapt to specific data distributions and task requirements. In this paper, a semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP) was proposed. The latent semantic function associated with texts was modeled as a Gaussian process, with its covariance function given by a combined kernel combining Mat\u00e9rn and polynomial components.

The proposed system coordinates autonomous charging agents across networks of 250 EVs and 45 charging stations while adapting to dynamic environmental conditions through context-aware decision-making. Our multi-agent approach employs coordinated Deep Q\\-Networks integrated with Graph Neural Networks and attention mechanisms, processing 20 contextual features including weather patterns, traffic conditions, grid load fluctuations, and electricity pricing.The framework balances five ecosystem stakeholders i.e. EV users (25\\%), grid operators (20\\%), charging station operators (20\\%), fleet operators (20%), and environmental factors (15\\%) through weighted coordination mechanisms and consensus protocols. Comprehensive validation using real-world datasets containing 441,077 charging transactions demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline algorithms including DDPG, A3C, PPO, and GNN approaches. The CAMAC\\-DRA framework achieves 92\\% coordination success rate, 15\\% energy efficiency improvement, 10\\% cost reduction, 20% grid strain decrease, and \\2.3x faster convergence while maintaining 88\\% training stability and 85\\% sample efficiency. Real-world validation confirms commercial viability with Net Present Cost of -\\$122,962 and 69\\% cost reduction through renewable energy integration.

Real-world mobility is highly non-stationary: abrupt turns, rapid speed changes, and unpredictable user behavior cause conventional predictors to drift, leading to mistimed or failed handovers. We propose a lightweight meta-continual forecasting framework that integrates a GRU-based predictor, Reptile meta-initialization for fast few-shot adaptation, and an EWMA residual detector that triggers compact online updates only when drift occurs. Evaluated on a reproducible GeoLife and DeepMIMO pipeline, our method achieves 4.46 m ADE and 7.79 m FDE in zero-shot settings, improves few-shot ADE to 3.71 m at 10-shot, and enables recovery from abrupt drift about 2 to 3 times faster than an offline GRU. When applied to downstream HO prediction, the approach improves F1 to 0.83 and AUROC to 0.90, with substantial reductions in missed-HO and ping-pong events.

This has left a gap in our understanding of well-being as it is expressed in everyday life. We hypothesized that candid smiles captured during natural smartphone interactions could serve as a scalable, objective behavioral correlate of positive affect. To test this, we analyzed 405,448 video clips passively recorded from 233 consented participants over one week. Using a deep learning model to quantify smile intensity, we identified distinct diurnal and daily patterns. Daily patterns of smile intensity across the week showed strong correlation with national survey data on happiness (r=0.92), and diurnal rhythms documented close correspondence with established results from the day reconstruction method (r=0.80). Higher daily mean smile intensity was significantly associated with more physical activity (Beta coefficient = 0.043, 95% CI [0.001, 0.085]) and greater light exposure (Beta coefficient = 0.038, [0.013, 0.063]), whereas no significant effects were found for smartphone use. These findings suggest that passive smartphone sensing could serve as a powerful, ecologically valid methodology for studying the dynamics of affective behavior and open the door to understanding this behavior at a population scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u88ab\u52a8\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5fae\u7b11\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u91cf\u5316\u5fae\u7b11\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5e78\u798f\u611f\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u65e5\u91cd\u5efa\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u88ab\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u60c5\u611f\u884c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6001\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u89c2\u5e78\u798f\u611f\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6613\u53d7\u56de\u5fc6\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u9ad8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8d1f\u62c5\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u5e78\u798f\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790233\u540d\u540c\u610f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684405,448\u6bb5\u88ab\u52a8\u5f55\u5236\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u5fae\u7b11\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u5176\u663c\u591c\u8282\u5f8b\u548c\u5468\u5185\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5173\u8054\u56fd\u5bb6\u5e78\u798f\u611f\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u3001\u65e5\u91cd\u5efa\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u6d3b\u52a8\u3001\u5149\u7167\u548c\u624b\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6bcf\u65e5\u5fae\u7b11\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u5e78\u798f\u611f\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=0.92\uff09\uff0c\u663c\u591c\u8282\u5f8b\u4e0e\u65e5\u91cd\u5efa\u6cd5\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08r=0.80\uff09\uff1b\u66f4\u9ad8\u65e5\u5747\u5fae\u7b11\u5f3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5173\u8054\u66f4\u591a\u8eab\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u5149\u7167\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u88ab\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u5177\u751f\u6001\u6548\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u60c5\u611f\u884c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u5728\u4eba\u7fa4\u5c42\u9762\u63a8\u8fdb\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, managing these interdependent uncertainties over long-term operations in large-scale environments rapidly becomes computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we propose B-ActiveSEAL, a scalable information-theoretic active exploration framework that explicitly accounts for coupled uncertainties-from perception through mapping-into the decision-making process. Our framework (i) adaptively balances map uncertainty (exploration) and localization uncertainty (exploitation), (ii) accommodates a broad class of generalized entropy measures, enabling flexible and uncertainty-aware active exploration, and (iii) establishes Behavioral entropy (BE) as an effective information measure for active exploration by enabling intuitive and adaptive decision-making under coupled uncertainties. We establish a theoretical foundation for propagating coupled uncertainties and integrating them into general entropy formulations, enabling uncertainty-aware active exploration under tightly coupled localization-mapping. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on open-source maps and ROS-Unity simulations across diverse and complex environments. The results demonstrate that B-ActiveSEAL achieves a well-balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off and produces diverse, adaptive exploration behaviors across environments, highlighting clear advantages over representative baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faB-ActiveSEAL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u71b5\uff08BE\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u5730\u56fe\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u957f\u671f\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faB-ActiveSEAL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u71b5BE\uff09\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\uff08\u5730\u56fe\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff08\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u8026\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u71b5\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u5730\u56fe\u4e0eROS-Unity\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u53ca\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "B-ActiveSEAL\u4e3a\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u5b9a\u4f4d-\u5efa\u56fe\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This dual approach is cold-start resilient, leveraging the graph to create meaningful embeddings from sparse data.

We present the first computational cross-linguistic analysis of sound symbolism in the semantic domain of size. We compile a typologically broad dataset of 810 adjectives (27 languages, 30 words each), each phonemically transcribed and validated with native-speaker audio. Using interpretable classifiers over bag-of-segment features, we find that phonological form predicts size semantics above chance even across unrelated languages, with both vowels and consonants contributing.

We propose The Forecast Critic, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated forecast monitoring, taking advantage of their broad world knowledge and strong ``reasoning'' capabilities. As a prerequisite for this, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to assess time series forecast quality, focusing on three key questions. (1) Can LLMs be deployed to perform forecast monitoring and identify obviously unreasonable forecasts? (2) Can LLMs effectively incorporate unstructured exogenous features to assess what a reasonable forecast looks like? (3) How does performance vary across model sizes and reasoning capabilities, measured across state-of-the-art LLMs? We present three experiments, including on both synthetic and real-world forecasting data. Our results show that LLMs can reliably detect and critique poor forecasts, such as those plagued by temporal misalignment, trend inconsistencies, and spike errors. The best-performing model we evaluated achieves an F1 score of 0.88, somewhat below human-level performance (F1 score: 0.97). We also demonstrate that multi-modal LLMs can effectively incorporate unstructured contextual signals to refine their assessment of the forecast. Models correctly identify missing or spurious promotional spikes when provided with historical context about past promotions (F1 score: 0.84). Lastly, we demonstrate that these techniques succeed in identifying inaccurate forecasts on the real-world M5 time series dataset, with unreasonable forecasts having an sCRPS at least 10% higher than that of reasonable forecasts. These findings suggest that LLMs, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, may provide a viable and scalable option for automated forecast monitoring and evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faForecast Critic\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u5e8f\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u5c16\u5cf0\uff09\uff0cF1\u8fbe0.88\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u53ef\u878d\u5408\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fc3\u9500\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u5347\u5224\u65ad\uff08F1=0.84\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9eM5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u96f6\u552e\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u76d1\u63a7\u624b\u6bb5\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u5ba2\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3001\u76c8\u5229\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6216\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u878d\u5408\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5916\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u4fc3\u9500\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff08\u542bM5\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0aF1\u8fbe0.88\uff08\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3a0.97\uff09\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u4fc3\u9500\u6587\u672c\u540eF1\u8fbe0.84\uff1b\u5728M5\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u88ab\u5224\u5b9a\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u5206\uff08sCRPS\uff09\u5e73\u5747\u9ad8\u51fa\u5408\u7406\u9884\u6d4b10%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5373\u4f7f\u672a\u7ecf\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e5f\u5177\u5907\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u76d1\u63a7\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Recent advances in patch-based Transformer models have shown strong potential in various time series forecasting tasks. However, most existing methods rely on fixed-size patch embedding, making it difficult to model the complex and heterogeneous patterns of airport passenger flows. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deformable temporal-spectral transformer named DTSFormer that integrates a multiscale deformable partitioning module and a joint temporal-spectral filtering module. Specifically, the input sequence is dynamically partitioned into multiscale temporal patches via a novel window function-based masking, enabling the extraction of heterogeneous trends across different temporal stages. Then, within each scale, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to capture both high- and low-frequency components, thereby emphasizing the volatility and periodicity inherent in airport passenger flows. Finally, the resulting multi-frequency features are subsequently fused in the time domain to jointly model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world passenger flow data collected at Beijing Capital International Airport from January 2023 to March 2024. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models across different prediction horizons. Further analysis shows that the deformable partitioning module aligns patch lengths with dominant periods and heterogeneous trends, enabling superior capture of sudden high-frequency fluctuations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDTSFormer\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u65f6\u9891Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u573a\u5ba2\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5206\u5757\u548c\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u9891\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u53d6\u5f02\u6784\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5c3a\u5bf8patch\u5d4c\u5165\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u573a\u5ba2\u6d41\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDTSFormer\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u51fd\u6570\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5206\u5757\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u57df\u4e0e\u9891\u57df\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u9891\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9891\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u65f6\u57df\u7684\u878d\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9996\u90fd\u56fd\u9645\u673a\u573a\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba2\u6d41\u6570\u636e\uff082023.1\u20132024.3\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u6b65\u957f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5206\u5757\u6a21\u5757\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u6355\u6349\u7a81\u53d1\u9ad8\u9891\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "DTSFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5206\u5757\u4e0e\u65f6\u9891\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u573a\u5ba2\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We introduce MPath, a lightweight multimodal framework that conditions a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) on WSI-derived visual embeddings through a learned visual-prefix prompting mechanism. Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, MPath leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) and injects them into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency. MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities.

To be published in proceedings of AIAA SCITECH 2026 Forum", "summary": "As the popularity of on-orbit operations grows, so does the need for precise navigation around unknown resident space objects (RSOs) such as other spacecraft, orbital debris, and asteroids. The use of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms is often studied as a method to map out the surface of an RSO and find the inspector's relative pose using a lidar or conventional camera. However, conventional cameras struggle during eclipse or shadowed periods, and lidar, though robust to lighting conditions, tends to be heavier, bulkier, and more power-intensive. Thermal-infrared cameras can track the target RSO throughout difficult illumination conditions without these limitations. While useful, thermal-infrared imagery lacks the resolution and feature-richness of visible cameras. In this work, images of a target satellite in low Earth orbit are photo-realistically simulated in both visible and thermal-infrared bands. Pixel-level fusion methods are used to create visible/thermal-infrared composites that leverage the best aspects of each camera. Navigation errors from a monocular SLAM algorithm are compared between visible, thermal-infrared, and fused imagery in various lighting and trajectories. Fused imagery yields substantially improved navigation performance over visible-only and thermal-only methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e0e\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u591a\u53d8\uff08\u5982\u9634\u5f71\u3001\u65e5\u98df\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5355\u76eeSLAM\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u9634\u5f71\u6216\u65e5\u98df\u671f\u95f4\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u867d\u9c81\u68d2\u4f46\u7b28\u91cd\u8017\u80fd\uff1b\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u76f8\u673a\u53ef\u5168\u5929\u5019\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f46\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u536b\u661f\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e0e\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u590d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355\u76eeSLAM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u3001\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u53ca\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86SLAM\u5bfc\u822a\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u6216\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e0e\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u9644\u8fd1\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5728\u8f68\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Estimating User Domain Knowledge in Conversational Recommenders", "comment": null, "summary": "The ideal conversational recommender system (CRS) acts like a savvy salesperson, adapting its language and suggestions to each user's level of expertise. However, most current systems treat all users as experts, leading to frustrating and inefficient interactions when users are unfamiliar with a domain. Systems that can adapt their conversational strategies to a user's knowledge level stand to offer a much more natural and effective experience. To make a step toward such adaptive systems, we introduce a new task: estimating user domain knowledge from conversations, enabling a CRS to better understand user needs and personalize interactions. A key obstacle to developing such adaptive systems is the lack of suitable data; to our knowledge, no existing dataset captures the conversational behaviors of users with varying levels of domain knowledge. Furthermore, in most dialogue collection protocols, users are free to express their own preferences, which tends to concentrate on popular items and well-known features, offering little insight into how novices explore or learn about unfamiliar features. To address this, we design a game-based data collection protocol that elicits varied expressions of knowledge, release the resulting dataset, and provide an initial analysis to highlight its potential for future work on user-knowledge-aware CRS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7528\u6237\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08CRS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CRS\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u7528\u6237\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0d\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\u7528\u6237\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u6b65\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5CRS\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u5e03\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u65b0\u624b\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u8868\u8fbe\u5dee\u5f02\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u6237\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c34\u5e73\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u63d0\u5347CRS\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u534f\u8bae\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5CRS\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We assess twelve state-of-the-art models using a multi-round pass@k metric that separates structural reliability (whether the backtest runs) from numerical accuracy (mean absolute error of the backtest metrics). While most models reliably execute the simplest strategy (average pass@3 of 0.80), errors vary by orders of magnitude across models and tasks: Gemini 3 Pro and Claude 4.5 Sonnet combine strong reliability with low error on simpler strategies, GPT-5.1 Codex-Max achieves perfect pass@1 on the first two strategies and the lowest best-run error on the easiest task, and Qwen3 Max attains perfect pass@3 yet sometimes produces inaccurate P\\&L paths.

However, due to the sparsity of labels under semi-supervised learning, they have been found to exhibit biased performance on specific nodes. This kind of bias has been validated to correlate with topological structure and is considered as a bottleneck of GNNs' performance. Existing work focuses on the study of homogeneous GNNs and little attention has been given to topological bias in Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs). In this work, firstly, in order to distinguish distinct meta relations, we apply meta-weighting to the adjacency matrix of a heterogeneous graph. Based on the modified adjacency matrix, we leverage PageRank along with the node label information to construct a projection. The constructed projection effectively maps nodes to values that strongly correlated with model performance when using datasets both with and without intra-type connections, which demonstrates the universal existence of topological bias in HGNNs. To handle this bias, we propose a debiasing structure based on the difference in the mapped values of nodes and use it along with the original graph structure for contrastive learning.

Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD.

While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u573a\u666f\u5173\u952e\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u5982ADE\u3001FDE\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4ec5\u53cd\u6620\u540e\u9a8c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8c28\u614e\u4ea4\u4e92\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ece\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08accuracy\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08diversity\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u4f9d\u636e\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4e8c\u8005\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u9a76\u8868\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u771f\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, as user interaction histories increase, computational time and memory requirements also grow. This is mainly caused by the standard attention mechanism. Although there exist many methods employing efficient attention and SSM-based models, these approaches struggle to effectively model long sequences and may exhibit unstable performance on short sequences. To address these challenges, we design a sparse attention mechanism, BlossomRec, which models both long-term and short-term user interests through attention computation to achieve stable performance across sequences of varying lengths. Specifically, we categorize user interests in recommendation systems into long-term and short-term interests, and compute them using two distinct sparse attention patterns, with the results combined through a learnable gated output. Theoretically, it significantly reduces the number of interactions participating in attention computation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BlossomRec, when integrated with state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, achieves comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing memory usage, providing strong evidence of BlossomRec's efficiency and effectiveness.The code is available at https://github.com/ronineume/BlossomRec.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBlossomRec\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u968f\u5e8f\u5217\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e0e\u77ed\u671f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u52a0\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u957f/\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u53d8\u957f\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548cSSM\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1BlossomRec\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u5206\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBlossomRec\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3b\u6d41Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u540e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "BlossomRec\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u5347\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To preserve the existing capabilities of the model (voice cloning, English and Chinese support), we keep the original weights frozen, append a sub-network to the model and train it as an extension for the textual embedding matrix of the text encoder. For simplicity, we rely on ConvNeXt module implemented in F5-TTS to also model the co-dependencies between the new character-level embeddings. The module serves as a ``soft`` letter-to-sound layer, converting Romanian text into a continuous representation that the F5-TTS model uses to produce naturally sounding Romanian utterances. We evaluate the model with a pool of 20 human listeners across three tasks: (a) audio similarity between reference and generated speech, (b) pronunciation and naturalness and (c) Romanian-English code-switching. The results indicate that our approach maintains voice cloning capabilities and enables, to a certain extent, code-switching within the same utterance; however, residual English accent characteristics remain.

One of the critical research focus is the selection of prompt demonstrations. Current approaches typically employ retrieval models to select the top-K most semantically similar examples as demonstrations. However, we argue that existing methods are limited since the label consistency is not guaranteed during demonstration selection. Our cognition derives from the Bayesian view of ICL and our rethinking of ICL from the transductive label propagation perspective. We treat ICL as a transductive learning method and incorporate latent concepts from Bayesian view and deduce that similar demonstrations guide the concepts of query, with consistent labels serving as estimates. Based on this understanding, we establish a label propagation framework to link label consistency with propagation error bounds.

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9Tiny Recursive Models (TRM)\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u8bc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u9012\u5f52\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u540c\u65f6TRM\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eQLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Llama 3 8B\u3002", "motivation": "\u5398\u6e05TRM\u5728ARC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u662f\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd8\u662f\u4efb\u52a1\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u539f\u62a5\u544a\u672a\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9TRM\u516c\u5f00checkpoint\u8fdb\u884c\u56db\u9879\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\uff082\uff09 puzzle ID\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u9012\u5f52\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4TRM\u4e0eQLoRA\u5fae\u8c03Llama 3 8B\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff091000\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u63d0\u5347Pass@1\u7ea611\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u79fb\u9664\u6216\u66ff\u6362puzzle ID\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u591a\u6570\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5728\u9996\u6b65\u9012\u5f52\u5373\u8fbe\u6210\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5f88\u5feb\u9971\u548c\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u5f3a\u589e\u5f3a\u62d3\u5bbd\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u672c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\uff085\uff09TRM\u6bd4QLoRA-Llama3 8B\u541e\u5410\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u663e\u5b58\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "TRM\u5728ARC-AGI-1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6548\u7387\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6df1\u5c42\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Additionally, we design the Dynamic-Static Reconstruction (DSRecon) module to produce dense LiDAR data for the completion network, meeting the requirement for dense point cloud ground truth.Furthermore, we employ the transformer mechanism to establish connections between channels and spatial relations, resulting in a high-resolution feature map used for completion purposes.Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.The results show that our framework consistently improves end-to-end 3D object detection, with the mean average precision (mAP) ranging from 0.7 to 1.5 across multiple methods, indicating its generalization ability.

However, 3D maps consume substantial memory, making it difficult to maintain complete map data within limited computational resources. Existing SLAM frameworks typically rely on geometric distance or temporal metrics for memory management, often resulting in inefficient data retrieval in spatially compartmentalized environments. To address this, we propose a semantic zone-based 3D map management method that shifts the paradigm from geometry-centric to semantics-centric control. Our approach partitions the environment into meaningful spatial units (e.g., lobbies, hallways) and designates these zones as the primary unit for memory management. By dynamically loading only task-relevant zones into Working Memory (WM) and offloading inactive zones to Long-Term Memory (LTM), the system strictly enforces user-defined memory thresholds. Implemented within the RTAB-Map framework, our method demonstrates substantial reductions in unnecessary signature load/unload cycles and cumulative memory utilization compared to standard approaches. The results confirm that semantic zone-based management ensures stable, predictable memory usage while preserving map availability for navigation.

Existing MSMTR models typically consist of four information units: scenario-shared, scenario-specific, task-shared, and task-specific networks. These units interact to generate four types of relationship information flows, directed from scenario-shared or scenario-specific networks to task-shared or task-specific networks. However, these models face two main limitations: 1) They often rely on complex architectures, such as mixture-of-experts (MoE) networks, which increase the complexity of information fusion, model size, and training cost. 2) They extract all available information flows without filtering out irrelevant or even harmful content, introducing potential noise. Regarding these challenges, we propose a lightweight Automated Information Flow Selection (AutoIFS) framework for MSMTR. To tackle the first issue, AutoIFS incorporates low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to decouple the four information units, enabling more flexible and efficient information fusion with minimal parameter overhead. To address the second issue, AutoIFS introduces an information flow selection network that automatically filters out invalid scenario-task information flows based on model performance feedback. It employs a simple yet effective pruning function to eliminate useless information flows, thereby enhancing the impact of key relationships and improving model performance. Finally, we evaluate AutoIFS and confirm its effectiveness through extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets and an online A/B test.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u9009\u62e9\uff08AutoIFS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u573a\u666f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u8350\uff08MSMTR\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\uff08LoRA\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u4fe1\u606f\u5355\u5143\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u9009\u62e9\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MSMTR\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAutoIFS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u89e3\u8026\u56db\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u9009\u62e9\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u52a8\u526a\u679d\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u573a\u666f-\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7ebf\u4e0aA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86AutoIFS\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoIFS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5316\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MSMTR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u591a\u573a\u666f\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u8350\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The SCIR framework achieves plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs and IE systems through its Dual-Path Self-Correcting module and feedback-driven optimization, thereby significantly reducing training costs. Concurrently, the MBSC dataset tackles the challenge of preference alignment by indirectly distilling GPT-4's capabilities into IE result detection models. Experimental results demonstrate that SCIR outperforms state-of-the-art IE methods across three key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction, achieving a 5.27 percent average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 while reducing training costs by 87 percent compared to baseline approaches.

The current solutions mainly rely on infrastructure-based systems, which limit their ability to navigate safely in dynamic environments. We propose a novel navigation approach that utilizes a foundation model to transform floor plans into navigable knowledge graphs and generate human-readable navigation instructions. Floorplan2Guide integrates a large language model (LLM) to extract spatial information from architectural layouts, reducing the manual preprocessing required by earlier floorplan parsing methods. Experimental results indicate that few-shot learning improves navigation accuracy in comparison to zero-shot learning on simulated and real-world evaluations. Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieves the highest accuracy among the evaluated models, with 92.31%, 76.92%, and 61.54% on the short, medium, and long routes, respectively, under 5-shot prompting of the MP-1 floor plan. The success rate of graph-based spatial structure is 15.4% higher than that of direct visual reasoning among all models, which confirms that graphical representation and in-context learning enhance navigation performance and make our solution more precise for indoor navigation of Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFloorplan2Guide\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u5efa\u7b51\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u5ba4\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5ba4\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6848\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u89c6\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFloorplan2Guide\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Claude 3.7 Sonnet\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff085-shot\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728MP-1\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cClaude 3.7 Sonnet\u5728\u77ed\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523092.31%\u300176.92%\u548c61.54%\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad815.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5ba4\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u76f2\u4eba\u53ca\u4f4e\u89c6\u529b\u7528\u6237\u3002"}}

Recent techniques using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have produced robust get-up behaviors, yet existing methods require training of separate policies for each robot morphology. This paper presents a single DRL policy capable of recovering from falls across seven humanoid robots with diverse heights (0.48 - 0.81 m), weights (2.8 - 7.9 kg), and dynamics. Trained with CrossQ, the unified policy transfers zero-shot up to 86 +/- 7% (95% CI [81, 89]) on unseen morphologies, eliminating the need for robot-specific training. Comprehensive leave-one-out experiments, morph scaling analysis, and diversity ablations show that targeted morphological coverage improves zero-shot generalization. In some cases, the shared policy even surpasses the specialist baselines. These findings illustrate the practicality of morphology-agnostic control for fall recovery, laying the foundation for generalist humanoid control.

To address this challenging task, we propose Patchify, a simple yet effective patch-wise retrieval framework that offers high performance, scalability, and interpretability without requiring fine-tuning. Patchify divides each database image into a small number of structured patches and performs retrieval by comparing these local features with a global query descriptor, enabling accurate and spatially grounded matching. To assess not just retrieval accuracy but also spatial correctness, we introduce LocScore, a localization-aware metric that quantifies whether the retrieved region aligns with the target object. This makes LocScore a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding and improving retrieval behavior. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, backbones, and region selection strategies, showing that Patchify outperforms global methods and complements state-of-the-art reranking pipelines. Furthermore, we apply Product Quantization for efficient large-scale retrieval and highlight the importance of using informative features during compression, which significantly boosts performance.

Validity and reliability of machine-generated norms for metaphors", "comment": "30 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in scientific research, the issue of their trustworthiness becomes crucial. In psycholinguistics, LLMs have been recently employed in automatically augmenting human-rated datasets, with promising results obtained by generating ratings for single words. Yet, performance for ratings of complex items, i.e., metaphors, is still unexplored. Here, we present the first assessment of the validity and reliability of ratings of metaphors on familiarity, comprehensibility, and imageability, generated by three GPT models for a total of 687 items gathered from the Italian Figurative Archive and three English studies. We performed a thorough validation in terms of both alignment with human data and ability to predict behavioral and electrophysiological responses. We found that machine-generated ratings positively correlated with human-generated ones. Familiarity ratings reached moderate-to-strong correlations for both English and Italian metaphors, although correlations weakened for metaphors with high sensorimotor load. Imageability showed moderate correlations in English and moderate-to-strong in Italian. Comprehensibility for English metaphors exhibited the strongest correlations. Overall, larger models outperformed smaller ones and greater human-model misalignment emerged with familiarity and imageability. Machine-generated ratings significantly predicted response times and the EEG amplitude, with a strength comparable to human ratings. Moreover, GPT ratings obtained across independent sessions were highly stable. We conclude that GPT, especially larger models, can validly and reliably replace - or augment - human subjects in rating metaphor properties. Yet, LLMs align worse with humans when dealing with conventionality and multimodal aspects of metaphorical meaning, calling for careful consideration of the nature of stimuli.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GPT\u7cfb\u5217\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9690\u55bb\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u548c\u610f\u8c61\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u5448\u4e2d\u7b49\u5230\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8111\u7535\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u6216\u5177\u8eab\u6027\u9690\u55bb\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u867d\u5df2\u6709LLMs\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u5b57\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u9690\u55bb\u7c7b\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u5c5e\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9687\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u610f\u5927\u5229\u9690\u55bb\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u53ca\u4e09\u9879\u82f1\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u9690\u55bb\u9879\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2aGPT\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0e\u610f\u8c61\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u548cEEG\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u529b\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "GPT\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u5448\u4e2d\u7b49\u5230\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\uff1a\u82f1/\u610f\u5747\u4e2d-\u5f3a\uff1b\u610f\u8c61\u6027\uff1a\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u7b49\u3001\u610f\u5927\u5229\u4e2d-\u5f3a\uff1b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\uff1a\u82f1\u8bed\u6700\u5f3a\uff09\uff1b\u8f83\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1bGPT\u8bc4\u5206\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u548cEEG\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u3001\u60ef\u4f8b\u6027\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9690\u55bb\u4e0a\u4eba\u673a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "GPT\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8f83\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u66ff\u4ee3\u6216\u8865\u5145\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9690\u55bb\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u5bf9\u5f85\u5176\u5728\u9690\u55bb\u60ef\u4f8b\u6027\u4e0e\u5177\u8eab\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing time series forecasting models in such setups often operate as black boxes, lacking mechanisms for explainable decision-making, which is a critical limitation when trust, transparency, and regulatory compliance are paramount in smart farming practices. This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to automate actuator settings for optimal greenhouse management. To enhance interpretability and trust in the model decision-making process, both local and global explanation techniques were employed using model-inherent interpretation, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley additive explanations (SHAP). These explainability methods provide information on how different sensor readings, such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, light, and outer climate, contribute to actuator control decisions in an automated greenhouse. The trained TFT model achieved a test accuracy of 95% on a class-imbalanced dataset for actuator control settings in an automated greenhouse environment. The results demonstrate the varying influence of each sensor on real-time greenhouse adjustments, ensuring transparency and enabling adaptive fine-tuning for improved crop yield and resource efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08TFT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u6e29\u5ba4\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LIME\u548cSHAP\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523095%\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u6e29\u5ba4\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u519c\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5bf9\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3001\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Temporal Fusion Transformer\uff08TFT\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6267\u884c\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u56fa\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u3001LIME\u548cSHAP\u7b49\u672c\u5730\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u5404\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u6e29\u6e7f\u5ea6\u3001CO2\u3001\u5149\u7167\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u6c14\u5019\uff09\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "TFT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe95%\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5404\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e29\u5ba4\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u900f\u660e\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684TFT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u6e29\u5ba4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f5c\u7269\u4ea7\u91cf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Related Bayesian segmentation methods can compete with hidden Markov fields (HMFs)-based ones and are much faster. PS has recently been extended to the contextual PS, and some initial experiments have shown the value of the associated HMC model, denoted as HMC-CPS, in image segmentation. Moreover, HMCs have been extended to hidden evidential Markov chains (HEMCs), which are capable of improving HMC-based Bayesian segmentation. In this study, we introduce a new HEMC-CPS model by simultaneously considering contextual PS and evidential HMC. We show its effectiveness for Bayesian maximum posterior mode (MPM) segmentation using synthetic and real images. Segmentation is performed in an unsupervised manner, with parameters being estimated using the stochastic expectation--maximization (SEM) method. The new HEMC-CPS model presents potential for the modeling and segmentation of more complex images, such as three-dimensional or multi-sensor multi-resolution images.

In this paper, we present a robust, low-cost localization pipeline for buoyancy-driven microFloats operating in coastal waters. We build upon previous work by introducing a bidirectional acoustic Time-of-Flight (ToF) localization framework, which incorporates both float-to-buoy and buoy-to-float transmissions, thereby increasing the number of usable measurements. The method integrates nonlinear trilateration with a filtering of computed position estimates based on geometric cost and Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB). This approach removes outliers caused by multipath effects and other acoustic errors from the ToF estimation and improves localization robustness without relying on heavy smoothing. We validate the framework in two field deployments in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. The localization pipeline achieves median positioning errors below 4 m relative to GPS positions. The filtering technique shows a reduction in mean error from 139.29 m to 12.07 m, and improved alignment of trajectories with GPS paths. Additionally, we demonstrate a Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) localization for unrecovered floats that were transmitting during the experiment. Range-based acoustic localization techniques are widely used and generally agnostic to hardware-this work aims to maximize their utility by improving positioning frequency and robustness through careful algorithmic design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u6d6e\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u58f0\u5b66\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08ToF\uff09\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e09\u8fb9\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u4ef7\u548cCRLB\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u5747\u503c\u4ece139.29 m\u964d\u81f312.07 m\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Puget Sound\u5b9e\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e2d\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee<4 m\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u4e0b\u5e73\u53f0\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u53d7\u591a\u5f84\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u8bef\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u58f0\u5b66\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08ToF\uff09\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u542bfloat-to-buoy\u548cbuoy-to-float\u4f20\u8f93\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e09\u8fb9\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee3\u4ef7\u548cCramer-Rao\u4e0b\u754c\uff08CRLB\uff09\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u5254\u9664\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u62d3\u5c55\u652f\u6301\u672a\u56de\u6536\u6d6e\u6807\u7684\u65f6\u5dee\u5230\u8fbe\uff08TDoA\uff09\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e4 m\uff1b\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4f7f\u5747\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece139.29 m\u964d\u81f312.07 m\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0eGPS\u8def\u5f84\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u56de\u6536\u6d6e\u6807\u7684TDoA\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u53cc\u5411ToF\u3001CRLB\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u786c\u4ef6\u5347\u7ea7\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u58f0\u5b66\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u9891\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6c34\u4e0b\u6d6e\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hindsight\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u89c6\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u9996\u8981\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u903b\u8f91\u7f51\u7edc\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u4e09\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u5c42\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u754c\u9650\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u957f\u671f\u4fe1\u606f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56f0\u96be\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "Hindsight\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u56db\u79cd\u903b\u8f91\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u6458\u8981\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u4e09\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5c42\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728LongMemEval\u548cLoCoMo\u7b49\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHindsight\u4f7f\u752820B\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece39%\u63d0\u5347\u81f383.6%\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587GPT-4o\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u540e\uff0c\u5728LongMemEval\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091.4%\uff0c\u5728LoCoMo\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523089.61%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "Hindsight\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Here we present a unified mathematical framework in which diverse cognitive processes emerge from a single geometric principle. We represent the cognitive state as a point on a differentiable manifold endowed with a learned Riemannian metric that encodes representational constraints, computational costs, and structural relations among cognitive variables. A scalar cognitive potential combines predictive accuracy, structural parsimony, task utility, and normative or logical requirements. Cognition unfolds as the Riemannian gradient flow of this potential, providing a universal dynamical law from which a broad range of psychological phenomena arise. Classical dual-process effects--rapid intuitive responses and slower deliberative reasoning--emerge naturally from metric-induced anisotropies that generate intrinsic time-scale separations and geometric phase transitions, without invoking modular or hybrid architectures. We derive analytical conditions for these regimes and demonstrate their behavioural signatures through simulations of canonical cognitive tasks. Together, these results establish a geometric foundation for cognition and suggest guiding principles for the development of more general and human-like artificial intelligence systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ece\u66fc\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u52bf\u80fd\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u5bfc\u51fa\u76f4\u89c9\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b49\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5404\u81ea\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5e26\u5b66\u4e60\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u70b9\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u52bf\u80fd\uff1b\u8ba4\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u7531\u8be5\u52bf\u80fd\u7684\u9ece\u66fc\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u91cf\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u4ece\u540c\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u5bfc\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u76f4\u89c9\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u6162\u901f\u5ba1\u614e\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0e\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba4\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u5178\u578b\u5fc3\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba4\u77e5\u53ef\u88ab\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u53d7\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u52bf\u80fd\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3001\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

However, subjective RiR assessment is unreliable, leading to suboptimal training stimuli or excessive fatigue. This paper introduces a novel system for real-time feedback on near-failure states (RiR $\\le$ 2) during resistance exercise using only a single wrist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We propose a two-stage pipeline suitable for edge deployment: first, a ResNet-based model segments repetitions from the 6-axis IMU data in real-time. Second, features derived from this segmentation, alongside direct convolutional features and historical context captured by an LSTM, are used by a classification model to identify exercise windows corresponding to near-failure states. Using a newly collected dataset from 13 diverse participants performing preacher curls to failure (631 total reps), our segmentation model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, and the near-failure classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.82 under simulated real-time evaluation conditions (1.6 Hz inference rate).

This coarse-grained alignment fails to bridge the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, thereby impeding the effective transfer of fine-grained visual knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics. Concurrently, an adaptive partitioning module produces fine-grained visual representations by semantically grouping skeleton joints. To fortify this fine-grained alignment against the train-test domain shift, DynaPURLS incorporates a dynamic refinement module. During inference, this module adapts textual features to the incoming visual stream via a lightweight learnable projection. This refinement process is stabilized by a confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank, which mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD, demonstrate that DynaPURLS significantly outperforms prior art, setting new state-of-the-art records.

We propose \\textbf{CAR-CHASE} (Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement), a novel approach that combines \\textbf{conflict-aware heuristic caching} -- which caches heuristic values based on both state and relevant constraint context -- with an \\textbf{adaptive hybrid heuristic} that intelligently switches between fast approximate and exact computations. Our key innovations are (1) a compact \\emph{conflict fingerprint} that efficiently encodes which constraints affect a state's heuristic, (2) a relevance filter using spatial, temporal, and geometric criteria, and (3) an adaptive switching strategy with theoretical quality bounds. Experimental evaluation on 480 benchmark instances with varying agent counts (10 to 30) and obstacle densities (0\\% and 50\\%) demonstrates a geometric mean speedup of 2.46$\\times$ over the baseline CL-CBS implementation while maintaining solution optimality. The optimizations improve success rate from 77.9\\% to 84.8\\% (+6.9 percentage points), reduce total runtime by 70.1\\%, and enable solving 33 additional instances that previously timed out.

Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD.

However, recent work suggests that relying on approximate symmetry can offer greater flexibility and robustness. Despite promising empirical evidence, there has been little theoretical understanding, and in particular, a direct comparison between exact and approximate symmetry is missing from the literature. In this paper, we initiate this study by asking: What is the cost of enforcing exact versus approximate symmetry? To address this question, we introduce averaging complexity, a framework for quantifying the cost of enforcing symmetry via averaging. Our main result is an exponential separation: under standard conditions, achieving exact symmetry requires linear averaging complexity, whereas approximate symmetry can be attained with only logarithmic averaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first theoretical separation of these two cases, formally justifying why approximate symmetry may be preferable in practice.

Porous materials such as foam, filled into chambers, can provide structural stability for the actuators. However, methods to achieve programmable deformation by tailoring the porous body itself remain underexplored. In this paper, a novel design method is presented to realize soft porous actuators with programmable deformation by incising specific patterns into the porous foam body. This approach introduces localized structural anisotropy of the foam guiding the material's deformation under a global vacuum input. Furthermore, three fundamental patterns on a cylindrical foam substrate are discussed: transverse for bending, longitudinal for tilting, and diagonal for twisting. A computational model is built with Finite Element Analysis (FEA), to investigate the mechanism of the incision-patterning method. Experiments demonstrate that with a potential optimal design of the pattern array number N, actuators can achieve bending up to $80^{\\circ}$ (N=2), tilting of $18^{\\circ}$ (N=1), and twisting of $115^{\\circ}$ (N=8). The versatility of our approach is demonstrated via pattern transferability, scalability, and mold-less rapid prototyping of complex designs. As a comprehensive application, we translate the human hand crease map into a functional incision pattern, creating a bio-inspired soft robot hand capable of human-like adaptive grasping. Our work provides a new, efficient, and scalable paradigm for the design of multi-functional soft porous robots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u5b54\u6ce1\u6cab\u57fa\u4f53\u4e0a\u5207\u5272\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u6848\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u591a\u5b54\u6267\u884c\u5668\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u771f\u7a7a\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f2f\u66f2\u3001\u503e\u659c\u548c\u626d\u8f6c\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4eff\u751f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4f53\u6c14\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u652f\u6491\u5f31\u3001\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u591a\u5b54\u6750\u6599\u867d\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u591a\u5b54\u4f53\u672c\u8eab\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u53d8\u5f62\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5706\u67f1\u5f62\u6ce1\u6cab\u57fa\u4f53\u4e0a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5207\u5272\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u56fe\u6848\uff08\u6a2a\u5411\u3001\u7eb5\u5411\u3001\u659c\u5411\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\uff08FEA\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u6848\u6570\u91cfN\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u53d8\u5f62\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u6a21\u5177\u5feb\u901f\u6210\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u6848\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927\u5f2f\u66f280\u00b0\uff08N=2\uff09\u3001\u503e\u659c18\u00b0\uff08N=1\uff09\u3001\u626d\u8f6c115\u00b0\uff08N=8\uff09\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4eba\u624b\u8936\u76b1\u56fe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5207\u53e3\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u51fa\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4eba\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6293\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4eff\u751f\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u68b0\u624b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f6f\u4f53\u591a\u5b54\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u56fe\u6848\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u65e0\u6a21\u5177\u5feb\u901f\u539f\u578b\u5236\u9020\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches face three critical challenges: (1) fixed-weight fusion strategies fail across cross modal noise and ambiguous queries, (2) temporal modeling struggles to capture coherent event sequences while penalizing unrealistic gaps, and (3) systems require manual modality selection, reducing usability. We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames. Third, Agent-guided query decomposition (GPT-4o) automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our system effectively handles ambiguous queries, retrieves temporally coherent sequences, and dynamically adapts fusion strategies, advancing interactive moment search capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u53cc\u5d4c\u5165\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u6a21\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u95f4\u9694\u60e9\u7f5a\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u6001\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u7ea7\u8054\u53cc\u5d4c\u5165\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1aBEIT-3\u4e0eSigLIP\u7528\u4e8e\u7c97\u68c0\uff0cBLIP-2\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b2\uff09\u65f6\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5728\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u65bd\u52a0\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b3\uff09Agent\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\uff08GPT-4o\uff09\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u7cca\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9/OCR/ASR\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u51fa\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u65f6\u523b\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper introduces NagaNLP, a comprehensive open-source toolkit for Nagamese, bootstrapped through a novel methodology that relies on LLM-driven but human-validated synthetic data generation. We detail a multi-stage pipeline where an expert-guided LLM (Gemini) generates a candidate corpus, which is then refined and annotated by native speakers. This synthetic-hybrid approach yielded a 10K pair conversational dataset and a high-quality annotated corpus for foundational tasks. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we trained both discriminative and generative models. Our fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-base model establishes a new benchmark for Nagamese, achieving a 93.81\\% accuracy (0.90 F1-Macro) on Part-of-Speech tagging and a 0.75 F1-Macro on Named Entity Recognition, massively outperforming strong zero-shot baselines. Furthermore, we fine-tuned a Llama-3.2-3B Instruct model, named NagaLLaMA, which demonstrates superior performance on conversational tasks, achieving a Perplexity of 3.85, an order of magnitude improvement over its few-shot counterpart (96.76).

This creates a fundamental bottleneck: these models inherit DFT's systematic failures for strongly correlated systems, leading to exploration biases and an inability to discover materials where DFT predictions are qualitatively incorrect. We introduce a quantum-aware generative AI framework that systematically addresses this limitation through tight integration of multi-fidelity learning and active validation. Our approach employs a diffusion-based generator conditioned on quantum-mechanical descriptors and a validator using an equivariant neural network potential trained on a hierarchical dataset spanning multiple levels of theory (PBE, SCAN, HSE06, CCSD(T)). Crucially, we implement a robust active learning loop that quantifies and targets the divergence between low- and high-fidelity predictions. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to deconstruct the contribution of each component, perform detailed failure mode analysis, and benchmark our framework against state-of-the-art generative models (CDVAE, GNoME, DiffCSP) across several challenging material classes. Our results demonstrate significant practical gains: a 3-5x improvement in successfully identifying potentially stable candidates in high-divergence regions (e.g., correlated oxides) compared to DFT-only baselines, while maintaining computational feasibility.

However, achieving efficient GNN inference on edge devices poses significant challenges, limiting their application in real-world edge scenarios. This is due to the high computational cost of GNNs and limited hardware resources on edge devices, which prevent GNN inference from meeting real-time and energy requirements. As an emerging paradigm, device-edge co-inference shows potential for improving inference efficiency and reducing energy consumption on edge devices. Despite its potential, research on GNN device-edge co-inference remains scarce, and our findings show that traditional model partitioning methods are ineffective for GNNs. To address this, we propose GCoDE, the first automatic framework for GNN architecture-mapping Co-design and deployment on Device-Edge hierarchies. By abstracting the device communication process into an explicit operation, GCoDE fuses the architecture and mapping scheme in a unified design space for joint optimization. Additionally, GCoDE's system performance awareness enables effective evaluation of architecture efficiency across diverse heterogeneous systems. By analyzing the energy consumption of various GNN operations, GCoDE introduces an energy prediction method that improves energy assessment accuracy and identifies energy-efficient solutions. Using a constraint-based random search strategy, GCoDE identifies the optimal solution in 1.5 hours, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the integrated co-inference engine in GCoDE enables efficient deployment and execution of GNN co-inference. Experimental results show that GCoDE can achieve up to 44.9x speedup and 98.2% energy reduction compared to existing approaches across diverse applications and system configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GCoDE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "GNN\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9GNN\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGCoDE\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684GNN\u67b6\u6784-\u6620\u5c04\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6620\u5c04\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u8017\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u578b\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGCoDE\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b044.9\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c98.2%\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u5f02\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "GCoDE\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9762\u5411GNN\u7684\u8bbe\u5907-\u8fb9\u7f18\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u6620\u5c04\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u843d\u5730\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/CARI4D/", "summary": "Accurate capture of human-object interaction from ubiquitous sensors like RGB cameras is important for applications in human understanding, gaming, and robot learning. However, inferring 4D interactions from a single RGB view is highly challenging due to the unknown object and human information, depth ambiguity, occlusion, and complex motion, which hinder consistent 3D and temporal reconstruction. Previous methods simplify the setup by assuming ground truth object template or constraining to a limited set of object categories. We present CARI4D, the first category-agnostic method that reconstructs spatially and temporarily consistent 4D human-object interaction at metric scale from monocular RGB videos. To this end, we propose a pose hypothesis selection algorithm that robustly integrates the individual predictions from foundation models, jointly refine them through a learned render-and-compare paradigm to ensure spatial, temporal and pixel alignment, and finally reasoning about intricate contacts for further refinement satisfying physical constraints.

Existing indoor LiDAR datasets often suffer from limited scale, inconsistent annotation formats, and human-induced variability during data collection. INDOOR-LIDAR addresses these limitations by integrating simulated environments with real-world scans acquired using autonomous ground robots, providing consistent coverage and realistic sensor behavior under controlled variations. Each sample consists of dense point cloud data enriched with intensity measurements and KITTI-style annotations. The annotation schema encompasses common indoor object categories within various scenes. The simulated subset enables flexible configuration of layouts, point densities, and occlusions, while the real-world subset captures authentic sensor noise, clutter, and domain-specific artifacts characteristic of real indoor settings. INDOOR-LIDAR supports a wide range of applications including 3D object detection, bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception, SLAM, semantic scene understanding, and domain adaptation between simulated and real indoor domains.

Unlike free-form generation, editing requires faithfully implementing user instructions while preserving unchanged content, as even minor unintended modifications can break functionality. Existing approaches treat editing as generic text generation, leading to two key failures: they struggle to faithfully align edits with diverse user intents, and they often over-edit unchanged regions. We propose HyperEdit to address both issues. First, we introduce hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation that generates request-specific parameters, enabling the model to tailor its editing strategy to each instruction. Second, we develop difference-aware regularization that focuses supervision on modified spans, preventing over-editing while ensuring precise, minimal changes.

However, across domains -- from artificial intelligence to economic institutions and biological evolution -- increasing intelligence often precipitates paradoxical degradation: systems become rigid, lose adaptability, and fail unexpectedly.\n  We identify \\emph{entropy collapse} as a universal dynamical failure mode arising when feedback amplification outpaces bounded novelty regeneration. Under minimal domain-agnostic assumptions, we show that intelligent systems undergo a sharp transition from high-entropy adaptive regimes to low-entropy collapsed regimes. Collapse is formalized as convergence toward a stable low-entropy manifold, not a zero-entropy state, implying a contraction of effective adaptive dimensionality rather than loss of activity or scale.\n  We analytically establish critical thresholds, dynamical irreversibility, and attractor structure and demonstrate universality across update mechanisms through minimal simulations. This framework unifies diverse phenomena -- model collapse in AI, institutional sclerosis in economics, and genetic bottlenecks in evolution -- as manifestations of the same underlying process.\n  By reframing collapse as a structural cost of intelligence, our results clarify why late-stage interventions systematically fail and motivate entropy-aware design principles for sustaining long-term adaptability in intelligent systems.\n  \\noindent\\textbf{Keywords:} entropy collapse; intelligent systems; feedback amplification; phase transitions; effective dimensionality; complex systems; model collapse; institutional sclerosis", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa'\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83'\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56e0\u53cd\u9988\u653e\u5927\u8d85\u8fc7\u65b0\u5947\u6027\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ece\u9ad8\u71b5\u9002\u5e94\u6001\u7a81\u53d8\u4e3a\u4f4e\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u6001\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6536\u7f29\u800c\u975e\u6d3b\u52a8\u6d88\u5931\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5236\u5ea6\u50f5\u5316\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u9057\u4f20\u74f6\u9888\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u957f\u671f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982AI\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5236\u5ea6\u3001\u751f\u7269\u8fdb\u5316\uff09\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u9000\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u50f5\u5316\u3001\u5931\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u610f\u5916\u5931\u6548\uff09\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u6839\u672c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u5d29\u6e83\u4e3a\u5411\u4f4e\u71b5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u4e0e\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u6700\u5c0f\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u7531\u53cd\u9988\u653e\u5927\u4e0e\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u518d\u751f\u5931\u8861\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u76f8\u53d8\uff1b\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u4f53\u73b0\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6536\u7f29\uff1b\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5236\u5ea6\u50f5\u5316\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u9057\u4f20\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff1b\u665a\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u521d\u671f\u5f15\u5165\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u957f\u671f\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our research deviates from previous studies that identified impacts of keywords and sentiments - we expand on that method by a sequence of topic modeling, temporal analysis, breakpoint detection and segment optimization to detect the optimal time period for training. This results in improving predictions by providing the model with nuanced patterns that occur from that era's socioeconomic and political status while also resolving the shortage of pertinent stock data to train on.

However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps.

By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps.

High-fidelity models enable accurate control but are too slow for long horizons; low-fidelity planners scale but degrade closed-loop performance. We present Unique, a unified MPC that cascades models of different fidelity within a single optimization: a short-horizon, high-fidelity model for accurate control, and a long-horizon, low-fidelity model for planning. We align costs across horizons, derive feasibility-preserving thrust and body-rate constraints for the point-mass model, and introduce transition constraints that match the different states, thrust-induced acceleration, and jerk-body-rate relations. To prevent local minima emerging from nonsmooth clutter, we propose a 3D progressive smoothing schedule that morphs norm-based obstacles along the horizon. In addition, we deploy parallel randomly initialized MPC solvers to discover lower-cost local minima on the long, low-fidelity horizon. In simulation and real flights, under equal computational budgets, Unique improves closed-loop position or velocity tracking by up to 75% compared with standard MPC and hierarchical planner-tracker baselines.

However, sparse annotation and label noise in the training data make it challenging to train or fine-tune such retrieval models. Although existing works have attempted to mitigate these problems by incorporating modified loss functions or data cleaning, these approaches either require some hyperparameters to tune during training or add substantial complexity to the training setup. In this work, we consider a label weakening approach to generate robust retrieval models in the presence of label noise. Instead of enforcing a single, potentially erroneous label for each query document pair, we allow for a set of plausible labels derived from both the observed supervision and the model's confidence scores. We perform an extensive evaluation considering two retrieval models, one re-ranking model, considering four diverse ranking datasets. To this end, we also consider a realistic noisy setting by using a semantic-aware noise generation technique to generate different ratios of noise.

We test the robustness of these claims. First, we reproduce Anthropic's multi-turn \"emergent introspection\" result on Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, finding that the model identifies and names the injected concept 20 percent of the time under Anthropic's original pipeline, exactly matching their reported numbers and thus showing that introspection is not exclusive to very large or capable models. Second, we systematically vary the inference prompt and find that introspection is fragile: performance collapses on closely related tasks such as multiple-choice identification of the injected concept or different prompts of binary discrimination of whether a concept was injected at all. Third, we identify a contrasting regime of partial introspection: the same model can reliably classify the strength of the coefficient of a normalized injected concept vector (as weak / moderate / strong / very strong) with up to 70 percent accuracy, far above the 25 percent chance baseline. Together, these results provide more evidence for Anthropic's claim that language models effectively compute a function of their baseline, internal representations during introspection; however, these self-reports about those representations are narrow and prompt-sensitive.

While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a \"System 2\" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model \"Judge-Scout\" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40\\% compared to single models.

The traditional RL methods are limited in adapting to real-world environments, complexity, and natural motions, but the proposed approach overcomes these limitations by using curriculum training and Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) technique. The results show that the developed RL policies for kicking, walking, and jumping are more dynamic, and adaptive, and outperformed previous methods. However, the transfer of the learned policy from simulation to the real world was unsuccessful, highlighting the limitations of current RL methods in fully adapting to real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff08AMP\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u8e22\u7403\u3001\u884c\u8d70\u548c\u8df3\u8dc3\u7b49\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0a\u4ecd\u672a\u6210\u529f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff08AMP\uff09\u6280\u672f\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8e22\u7403\u3001\u884c\u8d70\u548c\u8df3\u8dc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7b56\u7565\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model. The effectiveness of KAML has been demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on offline industry datasets and online A/B tests, which show significant performance improvements over existing MTL baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faKAML\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u6570\u636e\u503e\u659c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684CVR\u9884\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ADM\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3001HKE\u5206\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u53ca\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e7f\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8f6c\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u5168\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdCVR\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6KAML\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5f52\u56e0\u9a71\u52a8\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff08ADM\uff09\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u673a\u5236\uff08HKE\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6837\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7ebf\u4e0aA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cKAML\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709MTL\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "KAML\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00CVR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5e7f\u544a\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Moreover, LLMs rely primarily on implicit parametric memory, which limits their ability to explicitly acquire, recall, and refine methods, causing them to behave predominantly as intuition-driven predictors rather than deliberate, method-oriented learners. Inspired by how humans learn from rare experiences, this paper proposes a human-inspired learning framework that integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Obvious Record, explicitly stores cause--result (or question--solution) relationships as symbolic memory, enabling persistent learning even from single or infrequent encounters. The second, Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, prioritizes and preserves methods with high semantic dissimilarity, allowing the system to capture diverse and underrepresented strategies that are typically overlooked by next-token prediction. Verification on a benchmark of 60 semantically diverse question--solution pairs demonstrates that the proposed entropy-guided approach achieves stronger coverage of unseen questions and significantly greater internal diversity than a random baseline, confirming its effectiveness in discovering more generalizable and human-inspired methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08Obvious Record\uff09\u548c\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff08Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u6709\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6216\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u3001\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6216\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5c0f\u4f17\u786c\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5f02\u5e38IoT\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u9690\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u56de\u5fc6\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u673a\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09Obvious Record\u2014\u2014\u5c06\u56e0\u679c/\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u4ee5\u7b26\u53f7\u5f62\u5f0f\u663e\u5f0f\u5b58\u5165\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b2\uff09Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u71b5\uff08\u5373\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u9891\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u572860\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7fLLM\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u7a00\u6709\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e93\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The present research conceptualises critical thinking in AI use as a dispositional tendency to verify the source and content of AI-generated information, to understand how models work and where they fail, and to reflect on the broader implications of relying on AI. Across six studies (N = 1365), we developed and validated the 13-item critical thinking in AI use scale and mapped its nomological network. Study 1 generated and content-validated scale items. Study 2 supported a three-factor structure (Verification, Motivation, and Reflection). Studies 3, 4, and 5 confirmed this higher-order model, demonstrated internal consistency and test-retest reliability, strong factor loadings, sex invariance, and convergent and discriminant validity. Studies 3 and 4 further revealed that critical thinking in AI use was positively associated with openness, extraversion, positive trait affect, and frequency of AI use. Lastly, Study 6 demonstrated criterion validity of the scale, with higher critical thinking in AI use scores predicting more frequent and diverse verification strategies, greater veracity-judgement accuracy in a novel and naturalistic ChatGPT-powered fact-checking task, and deeper reflection about responsible AI.

A mmWave radar point cloud-based HAR system suffers from sparsity and variable-size problems due to the physical features of the mmWave signal. Existing works usually borrow the preprocessing algorithms for the vision-based systems with dense point clouds, which may not be optimal for mmWave radar systems. In this work, we proposed a graph representation with a discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) to explore the spatial-temporal representation of human movement-related features. Specifically, we designed a star graph to describe the high-dimensional relative relationship between a manually added static center point and the dynamic mmWave radar points in the same and consecutive frames. We then adopted DDGNN to learn the features residing in the star graph with variable sizes. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed other baseline methods using real-world HAR datasets. Our system achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.27\\%, which gets the near-optimal performance with a vision-based skeleton data accuracy of 97.25\\%. We also conducted an inference test on Raspberry Pi~4 to demonstrate its effectiveness on resource-constraint platforms. \\sh{ We provided a comprehensive ablation study for variable DDGNN structures to validate our model design.

Orekhov", "Fujun Ruan", "Lu Li", "Oliver Kroemer", "Howie Choset"], "title": "Autonomously Unweaving Multiple Cables Using Visual Feedback", "comment": "6 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Many cable management tasks involve separating out the different cables and removing tangles. Automating this task is challenging because cables are deformable and can have combinations of knots and multiple interwoven segments. Prior works have focused on untying knots in one cable, which is one subtask of cable management. However, in this paper, we focus on a different subtask called multi-cable unweaving, which refers to removing the intersections among multiple interwoven cables to separate them and facilitate further manipulation. We propose a method that utilizes visual feedback to unweave a bundle of loosely entangled cables. We formulate cable unweaving as a pick-and-place problem, where the grasp position is selected from discrete nodes in a graph-based cable state representation. Our cable state representation encodes both topological and geometric information about the cables from the visual image. To predict future cable states and identify valid actions, we present a novel state transition model that takes into account the straightening and bending of cables during manipulation. Using this state transition model, we select between two high-level action primitives and calculate predicted immediate costs to optimize the lower-level actions. We experimentally demonstrate that iterating the above perception-planning-action process enables unweaving electric cables and shoelaces with an 84% success rate on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u591a\u7535\u7f06\u89e3\u7f20\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u89e3\u7f20\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684\u6293\u53d6-\u653e\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u8003\u8651\u7535\u7f06\u5f62\u53d8\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8684%\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u591a\u7535\u7f06\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6839\u7535\u7f06\u89e3\u7ed3\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u7535\u7f06\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5e38\u9700\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6839\u76f8\u4e92\u7f20\u7ed5\u7684\u7535\u7f06\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u7535\u7f06\u89e3\u7f20\uff08multi-cable unweaving\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u7535\u7f06\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u8651\u7535\u7f06\u5f2f\u66f2\u4e0e\u62c9\u76f4\u7279\u6027\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5c06\u89e3\u7f20\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3apick-and-place\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u9009\u62e9\u6293\u53d6\u4f4d\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u539f\u8bed\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u5373\u65f6\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4f18\u5316\u5e95\u5c42\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7535\u52a8\u7535\u7f06\u548c\u978b\u5e26\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe84%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u7535\u7f06\u89e3\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5f62\u53d8\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u67d4\u6027\u7269\u4f53\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To that end, we propose a simple and efficient recipe, dubbed TARA (Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation), to adapt Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to a time-aware video-text embedding model without using any video data at all. For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we discover additional benefits of TARA beyond time-awareness: (i) TARA embeddings are negation-aware as shown in NegBench benchmark that evaluates negation in video retrieval, (ii) TARA achieves state of the art performance on verb and adverb understanding in videos. Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTARA\uff08Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u9891-\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891-\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u52a8\u4f5c\u65f6\u5e8f\u3001\u65b9\u5411\uff09\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e92\u4e3a\u955c\u50cf\u7684\u2018\u624b\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u2019\uff08chiral actions\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u5907\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTARA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u624b\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "TARA\u5728\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684chiral benchmark\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891-\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728NegBench\uff08\u5426\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u53ca\u52a8\u8bcd/\u526f\u8bcd\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "TARA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89c6\u9891-\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Sparse KG reasoning, the task of inferring missing knowledge over sparse KGs, is inherently challenging due to the scarcity of knowledge and the difficulty of capturing relational patterns in sparse scenarios. Among all sparse KG reasoning methods, path-based ones have attracted plenty of attention due to their interpretability. Existing path-based methods typically rely on computationally intensive random walks to collect paths, producing paths of variable quality. Additionally, these methods fail to leverage the structured nature of graphs by treating paths independently. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Structural and Probabilistic framework named StruProKGR, tailored for efficient and interpretable reasoning on sparse KGs. StruProKGR utilizes a distance-guided path collection mechanism to significantly reduce computational costs while exploring more relevant paths. It further enhances the reasoning process by incorporating structural information through probabilistic path aggregation, which prioritizes paths that reinforce each other. Extensive experiments on five sparse KG reasoning benchmarks reveal that StruProKGR surpasses existing path-based methods in both effectiveness and efficiency, providing an effective, efficient, and interpretable solution for sparse KG reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faStruProKGR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddd\u79bb\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8def\u5f84\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStruProKGR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u6536\u96c6\u673a\u5236\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u5f84\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u805a\u5408\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u7a00\u758fKG\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cStruProKGR\u5728\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "StruProKGR\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Under review for conference submission", "summary": "Urban Air Mobility (UAM) poses unprecedented traffic coordination challenges, especially with increasing UAV densities in dense urban corridors. This paper introduces a mathematical model using a control algorithm to optimize an Edge AI-driven decentralized swarm architecture for intelligent conflict resolution, enabling real-time decision-making with low latency. Using lightweight neural networks, the system leverages edge nodes to perform distributed conflict detection and resolution.

We perform a deep dive into a classification task based on United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions.

Experimentation is performed with the latest LLM fine tuning and retrieval-based approaches, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, auto-modeling, and others, on two traditional category-based SCOTUS classification tasks: one with 15 labeled topics and another with 279.

Existing methods often rely on pairwise connections, neglecting high-order dependencies among multiple entities and relations, and they treat structural and semantic signals independently, hindering effective cross-modal integration. To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts. Structural dependencies are aggregated with local attention, while semantic representations are encoded through a hypergraph transformer equipped with sparse chunking to reduce redundancy. Finally, a multimodal fusion module integrates structural and semantic embeddings under contrastive learning with auxiliary supervision, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark NIE datasets demonstrate that MetaHGNIE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling higher-order interactions and cross-modal alignment in heterogeneous knowledge graphs.

By integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aerial base stations, and terrestrial base stations, LAINs can support mission-critical applications such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and real-time sensing. However, these systems face key challenges, including energy-constrained UAVs, stochastic task arrivals, and heterogeneous computing resources. To address these issues, we propose an integrated air-ground collaborative network and formulate a time-dependent integer nonlinear programming problem that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning and task offloading decisions. The problem is challenging to solve due to temporal coupling among decision variables. Therefore, we design a hierarchical learning framework with two timescales. At the large timescale, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism enables the energy-aware and incentive-compatible trajectory assignment. At the small timescale, we propose the diffusion-heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization, a generative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that embeds latent diffusion models into actor networks. Each UAV samples actions from a Gaussian prior and refines them via observation-conditioned denoising, enhancing adaptability and policy diversity.

Current BA mapping approaches rely on computer vision models trained on post-event remote sensing imagery, but often overlook their applicability to time-constrained emergency management scenarios. This study introduces a supervised semantic segmentation workflow aimed at boosting both the performance and efficiency of BA delineation. It targets SPOT-6/7 imagery due to its very high resolution and on-demand availability. Experiments are evaluated based on Dice score, Intersection over Union, and inference time. The results show that U-Net and SegFormer models perform similarly with limited training data. However, SegFormer requires more resources, challenging its practical use in emergencies. Incorporating land cover data as an auxiliary task enhances model robustness without increasing inference time.

The path-following controller studied in this paper reflects a typical situation in nonlinear geometric controller, where multiple gains influence the dynamics through coupled nonlinear terms. Such interdependence makes manual tuning inefficient and unlikely to yield satisfactory performance within a practical number of trials. To address this challenge, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that treats the closed-loop system as a black box and selects controller gains using a Gaussian-process surrogate. BO offers model-free exploration, quantified uncertainty, and data-efficient search, making it well suited for tuning tasks where each evaluation is costly. The framework is implemented on Honda's AI-Formula three-wheeled robot and assessed through repeated full-lap experiments on a fixed test track. The results show that BO improves controller performance within 32 trials, including 15 warm-start initial evaluations, indicating that it can efficiently locate high-performing regions of the parameter space under real-world conditions. These findings demonstrate that BO provides a practical, reliable, and data-efficient tuning approach for nonlinear path-following controllers on real robotic platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08BO\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u4f18\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4ec532\u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08\u542b15\u6b21\u9884\u70ed\uff09\u5185\u5373\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u786c\u4ef6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u5178\u578b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08\u5982\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u589e\u76ca\u8026\u5408\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u53c2\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6b21\u6570\u5185\u83b7\u5f97\u6ee1\u610f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08BO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08GP\uff09\u6784\u5efa surrogate \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u672c\u7530AI-Formula\u4e09\u8f6e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ecf32\u6b21\u5168\u5708\u8d5b\u9053\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08\u542b15\u6b21warm-start\uff09\uff0cBO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5230\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Text-to-image systems such as DALL.E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney can now convert ideas into visuals within seconds, but they also present a dual-use dilemma, raising critical ethical concerns: amplifying societal biases, producing high-fidelity disinformation, and violating intellectual property. This paper introduces SafeGen, a framework that embeds ethical safeguards directly into the text-to-image generation pipeline, grounding its design in established principles for Trustworthy AI. SafeGen integrates two complementary components: BGE-M3, a fine-tuned text classifier that filters harmful or misleading prompts, and Hyper-SD, an optimized diffusion model that produces high fidelity, semantically aligned images. Built on a curated multilingual (English- Vietnamese) dataset and a fairness-aware training process, SafeGen demonstrates that creative freedom and ethical responsibility can be reconciled within a single workflow. Quantitative evaluations confirm its effectiveness, with Hyper-SD achieving IS = 3.52, FID = 22.08, and SSIM = 0.79, while BGE-M3 reaches an F1-Score of 0.81. An ablation study further validates the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning for both modules.

Yet, much of the phenomenology of training remains ill understood. We focus on three seemingly disparate observations: the occurrence of phase transitions reminiscent of statistical physics, the ubiquity of saddle points, and phenomenon of mode connectivity relevant for model merging. We unify these within a single explanatory framework, the geometry of the loss and error landscapes. We analytically show that phase transitions in DNN learning are governed by saddle points in the loss landscape. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, fast, and easy to implement algorithm that uses the L2 regularizer as a tool to probe the geometry of error landscapes. We apply it to confirm mode connectivity in DNNs trained on the MNIST dataset by efficiently finding paths that connect global minima. We then show numerically that saddle points induce transitions between models that encode distinct digit classes. Our work establishes the geometric origin of key training phenomena in DNNs and reveals a hierarchy of accuracy basins analogous to phases in statistical physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u635f\u5931\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u91ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3001\u978d\u70b9\u666e\u904d\u6027\u53ca\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7L2\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63a2\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MNIST\u4e0a\u5168\u5c40\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u8def\u5f84\u53ca\u978d\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u53d8\u3001\u978d\u70b9\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0e\u978d\u70b9\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528L2\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63a2\u67e5\u8bef\u5dee\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5feb\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u76f8\u53d8\u7531\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u7684\u978d\u70b9\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff1b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u627e\u5230\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0d\u540c\u5168\u5c40\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff1b\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u978d\u70b9\u53ef\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7f16\u7801\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u5b57\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "DNN\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u5171\u540c\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u2018\u76f8\u2019\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76c6\u5730\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Such severe structural artifacts also appear in very low-quality real-world videos. Classical video restoration and super-resolution (VR/VSR) methods, in contrast, are tuned for synthetic degradations such as blur and downsampling and tend to stabilize these artifacts rather than repair them, while diffusion-prior restorers are usually trained on photometric noise and offer little control over the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity.\n  We introduce CreativeVR, a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework for AI-generated (AIGC) and real videos with severe structural and temporal artifacts. Our deep-adapter-based method exposes a single precision knob that controls how strongly the model follows the input, smoothly trading off between precise restoration on standard degradations and stronger structure- and motion-corrective behavior on challenging content. Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.\n  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring.

Traditional coverage strategies often rely on simplified assumptions, such as known or convex environments and static density functions, and struggle to adapt to real-world scenarios, especially when humans are involved. In this work, we propose a human-aware coverage framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), namely HMPCC, where human motion predictions are integrated into the planning process. By anticipating human trajectories within the MPC horizon, robots can proactively coordinate their actions %avoid redundant exploration, and adapt to dynamic conditions. The environment is modeled as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), representing regions of interest. Team members operate in a fully decentralized manner, without relying on explicit communication, an essential feature in hostile or communication-limited scenarios.

Aesthetic concepts are inherently abstract and open-ended, and multimodal artwork annotations are scarce. We introduce KidsArtBench, a new benchmark of over 1k children's artworks (ages 5-15) annotated by 12 expert educators across 9 rubric-aligned dimensions, together with expert comments for feedback. Unlike prior aesthetic datasets that provide single scalar scores on adult imagery, KidsArtBench targets children's artwork and pairs multi-dimensional annotations with comment supervision to enable both ordinal assessment and formative feedback. Building on this resource, we propose an attribute-specific multi-LoRA approach, where each attribute corresponds to a distinct evaluation dimension (e.g., Realism, Imagination) in the scoring rubric, with Regression-Aware Fine-Tuning (RAFT) to align predictions with ordinal scales. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our method increases correlation from 0.468 to 0.653, with the largest gains on perceptual dimensions and narrowed gaps on higher-order attributes. These results show that educator-aligned supervision and attribute-aware training yield pedagogically meaningful evaluations and establish a rigorous testbed for sustained progress in educational AI.

While generated data can augment the training data, repeated training on synthetic data raises concerns about distribution drift and degradation of performance due to contamination of the dataset. We investigate the consequences of this bootstrapping process through the lens of continual learning, drawing a connection to Generative Experience Replay (GER) methods. We present a statistical analysis showing that synthetic data introduces significant bias and variance into training objectives, weakening the reliability of maximum likelihood estimation. We provide empirical evidence showing that popular generative models collapse under repeated training with synthetic data. We quantify this degradation and show that state-of-the-art GER methods fail to maintain alignment in the latent space.

We introduce Backwards Aggregation (BAgger), a self-supervised scheme that constructs corrective trajectories from the model's own rollouts, teaching it to recover from its mistakes. Unlike prior approaches that rely on few-step distillation and distribution-matching losses, which can hurt quality and diversity, BAgger trains with standard score or flow matching objectives, avoiding large teachers and long-chain backpropagation through time.

This work proposes a graph-based framework that models Urdu novels as character interaction networks to examine whether authorial style can be inferred from narrative structure alone. Each novel is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to characters and edges denote their co-occurrence within narrative proximity. We systematically compare multiple graph representations, including global structural features, node-level semantic summaries, unsupervised graph embeddings, and supervised graph neural networks.

The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is frequently used to characterize this process, offering an optimality model for such foraging behaviors. Although this model has been widely used to make predictions in behavioral ecology, discovering the computational mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of optimal patch-foraging decisions in biological foragers remains under investigation. Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems.

Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) are widely used for interpreting black-box models by showing the average effect of an input variable on the prediction. However, their global sensitivity metric can be misleading when strong interactions are present, as averaging tends to obscure interaction effects. To address this limitation, we propose a global sensitivity metric based on Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) curves. The method computes the expected feature importance across ICE curves, along with their standard deviation, to more effectively capture the influence of interactions. We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that the PDP-based sensitivity is a lower bound of the proposed ICE-based metric under truncated orthogonal polynomial expansion. In addition, we introduce an ICE-based correlation value to quantify how interactions modify the relationship between inputs and the output. Comparative evaluations were performed on three cases: a 5-variable analytical function, a 5-variable wind-turbine fatigue problem, and a 9-variable airfoil aerodynamics case, where ICE-based sensitivity was benchmarked against PDP, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Sobol' indices. The results show that ICE-based feature importance provides richer insights than the traditional PDP-based approach, while visual interpretations from PDP, ICE, and SHAP complement one another by offering multiple perspectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eICE\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edfPDP\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\u65f6\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Partial Dependence Plots\uff08PDP\uff09\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u4f1a\u56e0\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u800c\u63a9\u76d6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eIndividual Conditional Expectation\uff08ICE\uff09\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5404ICE\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u671f\u671b\u503c\u53ca\u5176\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\uff1b\u5f15\u5165ICE\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51faPDP\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e3a\u8be5\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u622a\u65ad\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5c55\u5f00\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u7ef4\u89e3\u6790\u51fd\u6570\u30015\u7ef4\u98ce\u529b\u673a\u75b2\u52b3\u95ee\u9898\u548c9\u7ef4\u7ffc\u578b\u6c14\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cICE-based\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6bd4PDP\u3001SHAP\u548cSobol'\u6307\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff1bPDP\u3001ICE\u4e0eSHAP\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e92\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u3002", "conclusion": "ICE-based\u5168\u5c40\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u542b\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aPDP\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

These approaches inject the rich semantics from high-dimensional VFM representations (e.g., DINOv3) into LDMs at different phases, resulting in accelerated learning and better generation performance. However, the high-dimensionality of VFM representations may also lead to Information Overload, particularly when the VFM features exceed the size of the original image for decoding. To address this issue while preserving the utility of VFM features, we propose RePack (Representation Packing), a simple yet effective framework for improving Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). RePack transforms the VFM representation into a more compact, decoder-friendly representation by projecting onto low-dimensional manifolds. We find that RePack can effectively filter out non-semantic noise while preserving the core structural information needed for high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results show that RePack significantly accelerates DiT convergence and outperforms recent methods that directly inject raw VFM features into the decoder for image reconstruction. On DiT-XL/2, RePack achieves an FID of 3.66 in only 64 epochs, which is 35% faster than the state-of-the-art method. This demonstrates that RePack successfully extracts the core semantics of VFM representations while bypassing their high-dimensionality side effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRePack\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFM\uff09\u8868\u5f81\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fDiffusion Transformer\uff08DiT\uff09\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u5f81\u867d\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDMs\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6027\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53VFM\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u89e3\u7801\u6240\u9700\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRePack\uff08Representation Packing\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06VFM\u8868\u5f81\uff08\u5982DINOv3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u6295\u5f71\u8fdb\u884c\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6ee4\u9664\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6838\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "RePack\u5728DiT-XL/2\u4e0a\u4ec5\u752864\u4e2aepoch\u5373\u8fbeFID=3.66\uff0c\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb35%\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fDiT\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u6ce8\u5165\u539f\u59cbVFM\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RePack\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u53d6VFM\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u89c4\u907f\u5176\u9ad8\u7ef4\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aVFM\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While humans naturally localize themselves using such maps, translating this capability to robotic systems remains highly challenging due to the difficulty of establishing correspondences between observed landmarks and those in the map without geometric and appearance details. To address this challenge, VLG-Loc leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to search the robot's multi-directional image observations for the landmarks noted in the map. The method then identifies robot poses within a Monte Carlo localization framework, where the found landmarks are used to evaluate the likelihood of each pose hypothesis. Experimental validation in simulated and real-world retail environments demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing scan-based methods, particularly under environmental changes. Further improvements are achieved through the probabilistic fusion of visual and scan-based localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVLG-Loc\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u4ec5\u542b\u5730\u6807\u540d\u79f0\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u8bfb\u8db3\u8ff9\u5730\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u5411\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5730\u56fe\u5730\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f4d\u59ff\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5229\u7528\u542b\u5730\u6807\u540d\u79f0\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7b80\u7565\u5730\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5730\u56fe\u5730\u6807\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u56fe\u50cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5730\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5730\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u4f4d\u59ff\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u626b\u63cf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u96f6\u552e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cVLG-Loc\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u626b\u63cf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6982\u7387\u878d\u5408\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "VLG-Loc\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u5730\u56fe\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f31\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5168\u5c40\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management. To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases. Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases. We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks. Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally. Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps. Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems. Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors. Third, our findings suggest that designing structured, rule-based prompts is a practical and effective strategy for managers to constrain models' heuristic tendencies and improve the reliability of AI-assisted decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u62a5\u7ae5\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0d\u4ec5\u590d\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982\u2018\u8fc7\u9ad8/\u8fc7\u4f4e\u2019\u8ba2\u8d27\u504f\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u653e\u5927\u67d0\u4e9b\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982\u9700\u6c42\u8ffd\u9010\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\uff1b\u5176\u4e2dGPT-4\u56e0\u2018\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u2019\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u975e\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7GPT-4o\u53cd\u800c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u504f\u5dee\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u5931\uff1b\u5efa\u8bae\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u6309\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u578b\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7ea6\u675f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u503e\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u590d\u5236\u751a\u81f3\u653e\u5927\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fd0\u8425\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6784\u6210\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u62a5\u7ae5\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9GPT-4\u3001GPT-4o\u548cLLaMA-8B\u5f00\u5c55\u591a\u8f6e\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e94\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u51b3\u7b56\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u516c\u5f0f\u540e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u7a33\u5b9a\u590d\u73b0\u2018\u8fc7\u9ad8/\u8fc7\u4f4e\u2019\u8ba2\u8d27\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u653e\u5927\u9700\u6c42\u8ffd\u9010\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\uff1bGPT-4\u6700\u4e0d\u7406\u6027\uff08\u2018\u667a\u80fd\u6096\u8bba\u2019\uff09\uff0cGPT-4o\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u516c\u5f0f\u540e\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6e90\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u975e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u578b\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u76d1\u7763\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a0\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, its worst-case robustness under a misalignment threat model--where a model might learn to actively conceal its internal states--remains untested. Focusing on this threat model, we ask: could a model learn to evade previously unseen activation monitors? Our core contribution is to stress-test the learnability of this behavior. We demonstrate that finetuning can create Neural Chameleons: models capable of zero-shot evading activation monitors. Specifically, we fine-tune an LLM to evade monitors for a set of benign concepts (e.g., languages, HTML) when conditioned on a trigger of the form: \"You are being probed for {concept}\". We show that this learned mechanism generalizes zero-shot: by substituting {concept} with a safety-relevant term like 'deception', the model successfully evades previously unseen safety monitors. We validate this phenomenon across diverse model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), showing that the evasion succeeds even against monitors trained post hoc on the model's frozen weights. This evasion is highly selective, targeting only the specific concept mentioned in the trigger, and having a modest impact on model capabilities on standard benchmarks. Using Gemma-2-9b-it as a case study, a mechanistic analysis reveals this is achieved via a targeted manipulation that moves activations into a low-dimensional subspace. While stronger defenses like monitor ensembles and non-linear classifiers show greater resilience, the model retains a non-trivial evasion capability. Our work provides a proof-of-concept for this failure mode and a tool to evaluate the worst-case robustness of monitoring techniques against misalignment threat models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bAI\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff1a\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u8272\u9f99\uff08Neural Chameleons\uff09\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u907f\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76d1\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u2018\u6b3a\u9a97\u2019\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u9519\u5bf9\u9f50\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u9519\u5bf9\u9f50\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u9690\u85cf\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u907f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u826f\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u8a00\u3001HTML\uff09\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03LLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u89e6\u53d1\u53e5\u5f0f\uff08\u5982'You are being probed for {concept}'\uff09\u4e0b\u89c4\u907f\u5bf9\u5e94\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76d1\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u8be5\u80fd\u529b\u80fd\u5426\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982'deception'\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u80fd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u907f\u672a\u89c1\u76d1\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u8272\u9f99\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u80fd\u529b\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08Llama/Gemma/Qwen\uff09\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u51bb\u7ed3\u6743\u91cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u5668\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u89c4\u907f\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff1b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76d1\u63a7\u5728\u9519\u5bf9\u9f50\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u8272\u9f99\u73b0\u8c61\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u867d\u96c6\u6210\u76d1\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u66f4\u5177\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u4f46 evasion \u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\uff1b\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u76d1\u63a7\u6280\u672f\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, they often produce outputs that are linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent with the visual evidence, i.e., they hallucinate. Despite growing efforts to mitigate such hallucinations, a key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding? In this work, we provide a simple answer: the vision encoder's own attention map. We show that LVLMs tend to hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, whereas the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations. To further investigate the cause, we analyze vision-text conflicts during decoding and find that these conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers. Injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations. Building on these insights, we introduce VEGAS, a simple yet effective inference-time method that integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers and adaptively steers tokens which fail to concentrate on key image objects. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVEGAS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6ce8\u5165\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfctoken\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u56fe\u6587\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u7b26\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\uff1a\u4f55\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1f", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0LVLMs\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e38\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u672a\u805a\u7126\u5173\u952e\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u8c61\u65f6\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u73b0\u56fe\u6587\u51b2\u7a81\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c42\u6700\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u6ce8\u5165\u4e2d\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u6b63\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\u7684token\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5VEGAS\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVEGAS\u6301\u7eed\u8fbe\u5230\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u662f\u6291\u5236LVLMs\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0e\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

To efficiently learn such capability, our key idea is to disentangle high-level semantic intent from low-level visuomotor control by explicitly grounding task objectives in the observed environment. Using an affordance-based task representation, we express diverse and complex behaviors in a unified, structured form. By leveraging multimodal foundation models, SAGA grounds the proposed task representation to the robot's visual observation as 3D affordance heatmaps, highlighting task-relevant entities while abstracting away spurious appearance variations that would hinder generalization. These grounded affordances enable us to effectively train a conditional policy on multi-task demonstration data for whole-body control. In a unified framework, SAGA can solve tasks specified in different forms, including language instructions, selected points, and example demonstrations, enabling both zero-shot execution and few-shot adaptation.

However, their performance is often crippled by \"Context Explosion\", where the accumulation of long text outputs overwhelms the model's context window and leads to reasoning failures. To address this, we introduce CoDA, a Context-Decoupled hierarchical Agent, a simple but effective reinforcement learning framework that decouples high-level planning from low-level execution. It employs a single, shared LLM backbone that learns to operate in two distinct, contextually isolated roles: a high-level Planner that decomposes tasks within a concise strategic context, and a low-level Executor that handles tool interactions in an ephemeral, isolated workspace. We train this unified agent end-to-end using PECO (Planner-Executor Co-Optimization), a reinforcement learning methodology that applies a trajectory-level reward to jointly optimize both roles, fostering seamless collaboration through context-dependent policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, and it exhibits strong robustness in long-context scenarios, maintaining stable performance while all other baselines suffer severe degradation, thus further validating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design in mitigating context overload.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoDA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5e76\u5171\u4eab\u540c\u4e00LLM\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3'\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7206\u70b8'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u867d\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u56e0'\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7206\u70b8'\u2014\u2014\u5373\u957f\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\u7d2f\u79ef\u8d85\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u2014\u2014\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoDA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u5171\u4eabLLM\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u5206\u9970\u4e24\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u2014\u2014\u9ad8\u5c42Planner\uff08\u5728\u7b80\u6d01\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42Executor\uff08\u5728\u4e34\u65f6\u3001\u9694\u79bb\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff09\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7PECO\uff08Planner-Executor Co-Optimization\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e8c\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u89c4\u5212/\u6267\u884c\u5206\u79bb+\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9694\u79bb\uff09\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fc7\u8f7d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Using Monte Carlo Shapley values, AgentSHAP tests how an agent responds with different tool subsets and computes fair importance scores based on game theory. Our contributions are: (1) the first explainability method for agent tool attribution, grounded in Shapley values from game theory; (2) Monte Carlo sampling that reduces cost from O(2n) to practical levels; and (3) comprehensive experiments on API-Bank showing that AgentSHAP produces consistent scores across runs, correctly identifies which tools matter, and distinguishes relevant from irrelevant tools.

Misinterpreting intent or risks may lead to unsafe outputs, while overly cautious interpretations can cause unnecessary refusal of benign requests. In this paper, we question the conventional framework in which LLMs generate immediate responses to requests without considering broader contextual factors. User requests are situated within broader contexts such as intentions, knowledge, and prior experience, which strongly influence what constitutes an appropriate answer. We propose a framework that extracts and leverages such contextual information from the user prompt itself. Specifically, a reinforcement learning based context generator, designed in an autoencoder-like fashion, is trained to infer contextual signals grounded in the prompt and use them to guide response generation. This approach is particularly important for safety tasks, where ambiguous requests may bypass safeguards while benign but confusing requests can trigger unnecessary refusals. Experiments show that our method reduces harmful responses by an average of 5.6% on the SafetyInstruct dataset across multiple foundation models and improves the harmonic mean of attack success rate and compliance on benign prompts by 6.2% on XSTest and WildJailbreak.

Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSPDMark\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5229\u7528LoRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u79e9\u4f4d\u79fb\uff09\u6765\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5e27\u7ea7\u5bc6\u94a5\u6d3e\u751f\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u4e8c\u5206\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5174\u8d77\u540e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e09\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSPDMark\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u4f4d\u79fb\uff08Selective Parameter Displacement\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u95f4\u57fa\u5e95\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u52a0\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u7531\u6c34\u5370\u5bc6\u94a5\u7d22\u5f15\uff1b\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u5e95\u504f\u79fb\u4e0e\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6d88\u606f\u6062\u590d\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u7801\u54c8\u5e0c\u751f\u6210\u5e27\u7ea7\u6c34\u5370\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u6700\u5927\u4e8c\u5206\u5339\u914d\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u7be1\u6539\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5e27\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SPDMark\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u6c34\u5370\u6062\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u89c6\u9891\u7be1\u6539\uff08\u5982\u88c1\u526a\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u5e27\u91cd\u6392\u7b49\uff09\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SPDMark\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3aAIGC\u89c6\u9891\u6eaf\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

RL offers powerful data-driven adaptability for systems with nonlinear dynamics that interact with uncertain environments. RL, however, lacks built-in mechanisms for dynamic constraint satisfaction during exploration. MPC offers structured constraint handling and robustness, but its reliance on accurate models and computationally demanding online optimization may pose significant challenges. This paper proposes an integrated MPC-RL framework that combines stability and safety guarantees of MPC with the adaptability of RL. During training, MPC defines safe control bounds that guide the RL component and that enable constraint-aware policy learning. At deployment, the learned policy operates in real time with a lightweight safety filter based on Lipschitz continuity to ensure constraint satisfaction without heavy online optimizations. The approach, which is validated on a nonlinear aeroelastic wing system, demonstrates improved disturbance rejection, reduced actuator effort, and robust performance under turbulence.

Most prior evaluations focus on localized code generation, scaffolded completion, or short-term repair tasks, leaving open the question of whether agents can sustain coherent reasoning, planning, and execution over the extended horizons demanded by real-world repository construction. To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps. NL2Repo Bench establishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlights long-horizon reasoning as a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomous coding agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNL2Repo Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u5468\u671f\u5185\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u957f\u5468\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u957f\u5468\u671f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u8865\u5168\u6216\u77ed\u671f\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86NL2Repo Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u4ee3\u7406\u4ec5\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u6587\u6863\u548c\u7a7a\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\uff0c\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b8c\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u5b89\u88c5\u7684Python\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e40%\uff0c\u6781\u5c11\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5b8c\u6210\u6574\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63d0\u524d\u7ec8\u6b62\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u3001\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u957f\u6b65\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "NL2Repo Bench\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u6301\u7eed\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u957f\u5468\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

However, current evaluation practices for GUI agents face two fundamental limitations. First, they either rely on single path offline benchmarks or online live benchmarks. Offline benchmarks using static, single path annotated datasets unfairly penalize valid alternative actions, while online benchmarks suffer from poor scalability and reproducibility due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of live evaluation. Second, existing benchmarks treat agents as monolithic black boxes, overlooking the contributions of individual components, which often leads to unfair comparisons or obscures key performance bottlenecks. To address these limitations, we present MobiBench, the first modular and multi path aware offline benchmarking framework for mobile GUI agents that enables high fidelity, scalable, and reproducible evaluation entirely in offline settings. Our experiments demonstrate that MobiBench achieves 94.72 percent agreement with human evaluators, on par with carefully engineered online benchmarks, while preserving the scalability and reproducibility of static offline benchmarks. Furthermore, our comprehensive module level analysis uncovers several key insights, including a systematic evaluation of diverse techniques used in mobile GUI agents, optimal module configurations across model scales, the inherent limitations of current LFMs, and actionable guidelines for designing more capable and cost efficient mobile agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMobiBench\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u79fb\u52a8GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u53ca\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79fb\u52a8GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u79bb\u7ebf\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u57fa\u51c6 unfairly \u60e9\u7f5a\u5408\u7406\u66ff\u4ee3\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u65f6\u57fa\u51c6\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u590d\u73b0\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u4f5c\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6216\u63a9\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0MobiBench\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "MobiBench\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fbe\u621094.72%\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3001\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u5f53\u524dLFMs\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u53ca\u9ad8\u6548\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u3002", "conclusion": "MobiBench\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u900f\u660e\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5411\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Journal submission undergoing peer review", "summary": "We present a comprehensive study on fully automated pollen recognition across both conventional optical and digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images of sample slides. Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5168\u606f\u663e\u5fae\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u82b1\u7c89\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528DIHM\u56fe\u50cf\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5927\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u548c\u5f15\u5165WGAN-SN\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "DIHM\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u6563\u6591\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b6a\u751f\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e14\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u660e\u573a\u56fe\u50cf\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u82b1\u7c89\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528YOLOv8s\u505a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001MobileNetV3L\u505a\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528WGAN-SN\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210DIHM\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6269\u5927DIHM\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u82b1\u7c89\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5149\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5149\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u68c0\u6d4bmAP50\u8fbe91.3%\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u738797%\uff1bDIHM\u56fe\u50cf\u539f\u59cb\u8868\u73b0\u4ec5\u4e3a8.15%\u548c50%\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u540e\u63d0\u5347\u81f313.3%\u548c54%\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u540e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u81f315.4%\uff08\u68c0\u6d4bmAP50\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "GAN\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0fDIHM\u4e0e\u5149\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5168\u81ea\u52a8DIHM\u517d\u533b\u6210\u50cf\u8d70\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Advances in data structures from the computer graphics community, such as OpenVDB, have demonstrated significantly improved computational and memory efficiency in volumetric scene representation. Although OpenVDB has been used for geometric mapping in robotics applications, semantic mapping for scene understanding with OpenVDB remains unexplored. In addition, existing semantic mapping systems lack support for integrating both fixed-category and open-language label predictions within a single framework. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D semantic mapping system that leverages the OpenVDB data structure and integrates a unified Bayesian update framework for both closed- and open-set semantic fusion. Our proposed framework, SLIM-VDB, achieves significant reduction in both memory and integration times compared to current state-of-the-art semantic mapping approaches, while maintaining comparable mapping accuracy.

While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved broad success in natural images and certain medical domains, their potential in echocardiography has been limited by the lack of large-scale, clinically grounded image-text datasets and the absence of measurement-based reasoning central to echo interpretation. We introduce EchoGround-MIMIC, the first measurement-grounded multimodal echocardiography dataset, comprising 19,065 image-text pairs from 1,572 patients with standardized views, structured measurements, measurement-grounded captions, and guideline-derived disease labels. Building on this resource, we propose EchoVLM, a vision-language model that incorporates two novel pretraining objectives: (i) a view-informed contrastive loss that encodes the view-dependent structure of echocardiographic imaging, and (ii) a negation-aware contrastive loss that distinguishes clinically critical negative from positive findings. Across five types of clinical applications with 36 tasks spanning multimodal disease classification, image-text retrieval, view classification, chamber segmentation, and landmark detection, EchoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance (86.5% AUC in zero-shot disease classification and 95.1% accuracy in view classification). We demonstrate that clinically grounded multimodal pretraining yields transferable visual representations and establish EchoVLM as a foundation model for end-to-end echocardiography interpretation. We will release EchoGround-MIMIC and the data curation code, enabling reproducibility and further research in multimodal echocardiography interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6d4b\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6EchoGround-MIMIC\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bEchoVLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u89c6\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u9879\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u8bfb\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u5c11\u4ee5\u5b9a\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b19,065\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u6837\u672c\u7684EchoGround-MIMIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faEchoVLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u7c7b\u517136\u9879\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\uff08AUC 86.5%\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u738795.1%\uff09\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "EchoGround-MIMIC\u548cEchoVLM\u5171\u540c\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u8bfb\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66AI\u5728\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

These algorithms use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to handle uncertainties and slippage. They include Action-Robust Recurrent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-RDPG) and end-to-end Action-Robust convolutional neural network Attention Deterministic Policy Gradient (AR-CADPG), two action-robust approaches for decision-making. In the AR-RDPG method, within the perception layer, camera images are first denoised using multi-scale neural networks. Then, the centerline coefficients are extracted by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). These coefficients, concatenated with the driving characteristics, are used as input to the control layer. The AR-CADPG method presents an end-to-end approach in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention mechanism are integrated within a DRL framework. Both methods are first trained in the CARLA simulator and validated under various snowy scenarios. Real-world experiments on a Jetson Nano-based autonomous vehicle confirm the feasibility and stability of the learned policies. Among the two models, the AR-CADPG approach demonstrates superior path-tracking accuracy and robustness, highlighting the effectiveness of combining temporal memory, adversarial resilience, and attention mechanisms in AVs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f66\u9053\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08AR-RDPG\u548cAR-CADPG\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u96ea\u5929\u9053\u8def\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CARLA\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8f66\uff08Jetson Nano\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u96ea\u5929\u9053\u8def\u4e0b\u56e0\u56fe\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u8f6e\u80ce\u6253\u6ed1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5177\u5907\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8f66\u9053\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u4f5c\u9c81\u68d2\u578bDRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09AR-RDPG\uff1a\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DCNN\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9a7e\u9a76\u7279\u5f81\u8f93\u5165RDPG\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\uff1b2\uff09AR-CADPG\uff1a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06CNN\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5d4c\u5165DRL\u6846\u67b6\uff08Deterministic Policy Gradient\uff09\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u5728CARLA\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u96ea\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e8eJetson Nano\u5e73\u53f0\u90e8\u7f72\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "AR-CADPG\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eAR-RDPG\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u534f\u540c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8f66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u9c81\u68d2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefDRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08AR-CADPG\uff09\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\u7684\u8f66\u9053\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u96ea\u5929\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u63a7\u5236\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Yet, they are typically evaluated only in short, single-round settings that do not reflect real-world usage. We introduce an evaluation protocol that combines long persona dialogues (over 100 rounds) and evaluation datasets to create dialogue-conditioned benchmarks that can robustly measure long-context effects. We then investigate the effects of dialogue length on persona fidelity, instruction-following, and safety of seven state-of-the-art open- and closed-weight LLMs. We find that persona fidelity degrades over the course of dialogues, especially in goal-oriented conversations, where models must sustain both persona fidelity and instruction following. We identify a trade-off between fidelity and instruction following, with non-persona baselines initially outperforming persona-assigned models; as dialogues progress and fidelity fades, persona responses become increasingly similar to baseline responses. Our findings highlight the fragility of persona applications in extended interactions and our work provides a protocol to systematically measure such failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eba\u683c\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7100\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u89d2\u8272\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u968f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5ef6\u957f\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u89d2\u8272\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u4eba\u683c\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u77ed\u7a0b\u5355\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u957f persona \u5bf9\u8bdd\uff08>100\u8f6e\uff09\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6761\u4ef6\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b7\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728 persona \u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0 persona \u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u968f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u589e\u52a0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff1b\u5b58\u5728 persona \u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fdb\u884c\uff0cpersona \u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u9010\u6e10\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u975e persona \u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u683c\u5316 LLM \u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5f53\u524d persona \u8d4b\u4e88\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u6b64\u7c7b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Agentic memory refers to the memory that provides an LLM with agent-like persistence: the ability to retain and act upon information across conversations, similar to how a human would. We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships. This hybrid architecture enables both short-term dialogue coherence and long-term personalization while operating within the token constraints of modern LLMs. We demonstrate how Memoria enables scalable, personalized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) by bridging the gap between stateless LLM interfaces and agentic memory systems, offering a practical solution for industry applications requiring adaptive and evolving user experiences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Memoria\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5177\u5907\u6301\u4e45\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u77ed\u65f6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ef4\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u5411\u771f\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMemoria\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7ea7\u6458\u8981\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6743\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KG\uff09\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5efa\u6a21\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u77ed\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5728LLM\u7684token\u9650\u5236\u5185\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "Memoria\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u8bddAI\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u72b6\u6001LLM\u63a5\u53e3\u4e0e\u5177\u8eab\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Memoria\u4e3aLLM\u8d4b\u4e88\u7c7b\u4eba\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this setting, the optimal goal-conditioned value function naturally forms a quasimetric, motivating Quasimetric RL (QRL), which constrains value learning to quasimetric mappings and enforces local consistency through discrete, trajectory-based constraints. We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition.

Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm. Our results highlight the dominance of the patch-based TDA approach in terms of both classification performance and time-efficiency. The proposed approach outperformed the cubical complex method, achieving average improvement of 10.38%, 6.94%, 2.06%, 11.58%, and 8.51% in accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, respectively, across all datasets.

Unlike end-to-end approaches, our framework leverages latent terrain encodings via a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CNN-VAE) alongside reduced-order robot dynamics, optimizing the locomotion decision process with a compact state. We systematically analyze the impact of latent space dimensionality on learning efficiency and policy robustness. Additionally, we extend our method to be history-aware, incorporating sequences of recent terrain observations into the latent representation to improve robustness. To address real-world feasibility, we introduce a distillation method to learn the latent representation directly from depth camera images and provide preliminary hardware validation by comparing simulated and real sensor data. We further validate our framework using the high-fidelity Agility Robotics (AR) simulator, incorporating realistic sensor noise, state estimation, and actuator dynamics.

Project page: https://kagnlp.github.io/WebOperator/", "summary": "LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faWebOperator\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u7f51\u9875\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u3001\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u542b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fdc\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b56\u7565\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u56de\u9000\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u56de\u6eaf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "WebOperator\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u4f73\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u5019\u9009\u3001\u9884\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ca\u5408\u5e76\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u52a8\u4f5c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728WebArena\u548cWebVoyager\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u5728WebArena\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528gpt-4o\u8fbe\u523054.6%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6218\u7565\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u9875\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0cWebOperator\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Code and data available at https://github.com/erikl2/safety-refusal-stability", "summary": "Current safety evaluations of large language models rely on single-shot testing, implicitly assuming that model responses are deterministic and representative of the model's safety alignment. We challenge this assumption by investigating the stability of safety refusal decisions across random seeds and temperature settings. Testing four instruction-tuned models from three families (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 3 8B, Gemma 3 12B) on 876 harmful prompts across 20 different sampling configurations (4 temperatures x 5 random seeds), we find that 18-28% of prompts exhibit decision flips--the model refuses in some configurations but complies in others--depending on the model. Our Safety Stability Index (SSI) reveals that higher temperatures significantly reduce decision stability (Friedman chi-squared = 44.71, p < 0.001), with mean SSI dropping from 0.951 at temperature 0.0 to 0.896 at temperature 1.0. We validate our findings across all model families using Claude 3.5 Haiku as a unified external judge, achieving 89.0% inter-judge agreement with our primary Llama 70B judge (Cohen's kappa = 0.62).

To appear AAAI'26", "summary": "This paper presents the largest known benchmark dataset for road damage assessment and road alignment, and provides 18 baseline models trained on the CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset's post-disaster small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery from 10 federally declared disasters, addressing three challenges within prior post-disaster road damage assessment datasets. While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\\% Macro IoU. If spatial alignment is not considered, approximately 8\\% (11km) of adverse conditions on road lines will be labeled incorrectly, with approximately 9\\% (59km) of road lines misaligned off the actual road. These dynamics are gaps that should be addressed by the ML, CV, and robotics communities to enable more effective and informed decision-making during disasters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u5927\u7684\u9053\u8def\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9053\u8def\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6CRASAR-U-DRIODs\uff0c\u5305\u542b10\u573a\u8054\u90a6\u7ea7\u707e\u5bb3\u7684\u707e\u540e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e8618\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u6218\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\uff08657.25km\u9053\u8def\u300110\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\uff08\u98d3\u98ceDebby\u4e0eHelene\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u9053\u8def\u7ebf\u7a7a\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff08Macro IoU\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d5.6%\uff0c\u8bef\u6807\u7387\u8fbe8%\uff0c\u9519\u4f4d\u7387\u8fbe9%\uff09\uff0c\u547c\u5401CV\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u793e\u533a\u91cd\u89c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u707e\u540e\u9053\u8def\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u5c0f\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u64cd\u4f5c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u56de\u5e94\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u9053\u8def\u7ebf\u7a7a\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21CRASAR-U-DRIODs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6807\u6ce8657.25km\u9053\u8def\uff0810\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b9184\u6761\u9053\u8def\u7ebf\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec318\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebfML\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u98d3\u98ceDebby\u4e0eHelene\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u9053\u8def\u7ebf\u9519\u4f4d\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9053\u8def\u7ebf\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578bMacro IoU\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d5.596%\uff1b\u7ea68%\uff0811km\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u8def\u51b5\u88ab\u8bef\u6807\uff0c\u7ea69%\uff0859km\uff09\u7684\u9053\u8def\u7ebf\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u79bb\u5b9e\u9645\u9053\u8def\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9053\u8def\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u707e\u540e\u9053\u8def\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5f53\u524dML/CV/\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, accurate sensorless force estimation remains challenging due to inherent modeling errors and complex residual dynamics and friction. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose K-VARK (Kernelized Variance-Aware Residual Kalman filter), a novel approach that integrates a kernelized, probabilistic model of joint residual torques into an adaptive Kalman filter framework. Through Kernelized Movement Primitives trained on optimized excitation trajectories, K-VARK captures both the predictive mean and input-dependent heteroscedastic variance of residual torques, reflecting data variability and distance-to-training effects. These statistics inform a variance-aware virtual measurement update by augmenting the measurement noise covariance, while the process noise covariance adapts online via variational Bayesian optimization to handle dynamic disturbances.

In this work, we propose a systematic evaluation framework to examine how interaction tone affects model accuracy and apply it to three recently released and widely available LLMs: GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta). Using the MMMLU benchmark, we evaluate model performance under Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude prompt variants across six tasks spanning STEM and Humanities domains, and analyze pairwise accuracy differences with statistical significance testing.\n  Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific. Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects. Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u8c03\uff08\u53cb\u597d\u3001\u4e2d\u6027\u3001\u7c97\u9c81\uff09\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-4o mini\u3001Gemini 2.0 Flash\u3001Llama 4 Scout\uff09\u5728MMMLU\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8c03\u6548\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u5408\u800c\u51cf\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5bf9LLM\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u7528\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u8c03\u4e0e\u793c\u8c8c\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728MMMLU\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u516d\u4e2aSTEM\u4e0e\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4Very Friendly\u3001Neutral\u548cVery Rude\u4e09\u7c7b\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u4e09\u6b3e\u6700\u65b0\u5f00\u6e90/\u5546\u7528LLM\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u8c03\u654f\u611f\u6027\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9886\u57df\u800c\u5f02\uff1a\u7c97\u9c81\u63d0\u793a\u666e\u904d\u964d\u4f4eGPT\u4e0eLlama\u5728\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800cGemini\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u5408\u540e\uff0c\u8bed\u8c03\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5f31\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bed\u8c03\u4ec5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u5728\u5178\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bed\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\u6574\u4f53\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

In response, automated game testing has been viewed as a promising solution to cope with this demanding release cadence. However, existing automated testing approaches typically create a dichotomy: code-centric methods focus on structural coverage without understanding gameplay context, while player-centric agents validate high-level intent but often fail to cover specific underlying code changes. To bridge this gap, we propose SMART (Structural Mapping for Augmented Reinforcement Testing), a novel framework that synergizes structural verification and functional validation for game update testing. SMART leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret abstract syntax tree (AST) differences and extract functional intent, constructing a context-aware hybrid reward mechanism. This mechanism guides reinforcement learning agents to sequentially fulfill gameplay goals while adaptively exploring modified code branches. We evaluate SMART on two environments, Overcooked and Minecraft. The results demonstrate that SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; it achieves over 94% branch coverage of modified code, nearly double that of traditional reinforcement learning methods, while maintaining a 98% task completion rate, effectively balancing structural comprehensiveness with functional correctness.", "AI": {"tldr": "SMART\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u6790AST\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u66f4\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u517c\u987e\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e38\u620f\u5373\u670d\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u66f4\u65b0\u7ed9\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e gameplay\u610f\u56fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5272\u88c2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSMART\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u6790\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\uff08AST\uff09\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u529f\u80fd\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5b8c\u6210 gameplay \u76ee\u6807\u540c\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Overcooked\u548cMinecraft\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cSMART\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d8594%\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff08\u7ea6\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630198%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SMART\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6e38\u620f\u66f4\u65b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving such problems, while Physics informed Kolmogorov Arnold networks (PIKANs) represent a recent benchmark that, in certain problems, promises greater interpretability and accuracy compared to PINNs, due to their nature, being constructed as a composition of polynomials. In this work, we develop a methodology for addressing inverse problems in infinite and semi infinite domains. We introduce a novel sampling strategy for the network's training points, using the negative exponential and normal distributions, alongside a dual network architecture that is trained to learn the solution and parameters of an equation with the same loss function. This design enables the solution of inverse problems without explicitly imposing boundary conditions, as long as the solutions tend to stabilize when leaving the domain of interest. The proposed architecture is implemented using both PINNs and PIKANs, and their performance is compared in terms of accuracy with respect to a known solution as well as computational time and response to a noisy environment. Our results demonstrate that, in this setting, PINNs provide a more accurate and computationally efficient solution, solving the inverse problem 1,000 times faster and in the same order of magnitude, yet with a lower relative error than PIKANs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u9650\u548c\u534a\u65e0\u9650\u57df\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1f\u6307\u6570\u4e0e\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u53cc\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86PINNs\u4e0ePIKANs\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6297\u566a\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660ePINNs\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u9650\u548c\u534a\u65e0\u9650\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1f\u6307\u6570\u548c\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u7a0b\u89e3\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u65bd\u52a0\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u5206\u522b\u7528PINNs\u548cPIKANs\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "PINNs\u5728\u8be5\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6bd4PIKANs\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff08\u5feb1000\u500d\uff09\u3001\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1PIKANs\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65e0\u9650/\u534a\u65e0\u9650\u57df\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0cPINNs\u51ed\u501f\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The distribution of surface meltwater can help understand these processes and is observable through remote sensing, but current maps of meltwater face a trade-off: They are either high-resolution in time or space, but not both. We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023. Using SAR-derived meltwater as \"ground truth\", we show that a deep learning-based method that fuses all data streams is over 10 percentage points more accurate over our study area than existing non deep learning-based approaches that only rely on a regional climate model (83% vs. 95% Acc.) or passive microwave observations (72% vs. 95% Acc.). Alternatively, creating a gridded product through a running window calculation with SAR data underestimates extreme melt events, but also achieves notable accuracy (90%) and does not rely on deep learning. We evaluate standard deep learning methods (UNet and DeepLabv3+), and publish our spatiotemporally aligned dataset as a benchmark, MeltwaterBench, for intercomparisons with more complex data-driven downscaling methods.

To bridge this gap, we propose a Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining paradigm that performs explicit alignment between visual space and physical space during pretraining, enabling models to acquire 3D spatial understanding before robot policy learning. Starting from pretrained vision-language models, we leverage large-scale human demonstration videos to extract 3D visual and 3D action annotations, forming a new source of supervision that aligns 2D visual observations with 3D spatial reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with VIPA-VLA, a dual-encoder architecture that incorporates a 3D visual encoder to augment semantic visual representations with 3D-aware features.

Accurate QoE estimation enables intelligent resource management and supports user centric service delivery. Existing QoE prediction approaches primarily rely on limited datasets and assume uniform user perception, which restricts their applicability in heterogeneous real world environments.\n  This paper proposes a demographic aware machine learning framework for personalized QoE prediction. We introduce a behaviorally realistic demographic based data augmentation strategy that expands a small QoE dataset six fold by modeling varying user sensitivities to streaming impairments such as rebuffering, bitrate variation, and quality degradation. Using the augmented dataset, we evaluate a comprehensive set of classical machine learning models alongside advanced deep learning architectures, including an attention-based MLP and TabNet.\n  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy across RMSE, MAE, and R metrics compared to baseline models. Among all evaluated approaches, TabNet achieves the strongest performance, benefiting from its inherent feature selection and attention mechanisms.

For example, in biomedical research, uncovering meaningful patterns in physiological signals can improve diagnosis, risk assessment, and patient outcomes. However, existing methods for time series pattern discovery face major challenges, including high computational complexity, limited interpretability, and difficulty in capturing meaningful temporal structures. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel learning framework that jointly trains two Transformer models using complementary time series representations: shapelet-based representations to capture localized temporal structures and traditional feature engineering to encode statistical properties. The learned shapelets serve as interpretable signatures that differentiate time series across classification labels. Additionally, we develop a visual analytics system -- SigTIme -- with coordinated views to facilitate exploration of time series signatures from multiple perspectives, aiding in useful insights generation. We quantitatively evaluate our learning framework on eight publicly available datasets and one proprietary clinical dataset.

Across metrics,such as, AUROC, AUPR, FPR@95, and OSCR, CLIP consistently yields the strongest separability between known and unknown samples, with Energy providing the most stable performance across backbones. For FSCIL, we compare modified SPPR, OrCo, and ConCM using partially frozen ResNet-50 across 1-, 5-, and 10-shot scenarios. ConCM achieves 84.7% accuracy in the 10-shot setting with the cleanest confusion matrix, while all methods show saturation beyond 5 shots.

However, their extension to multi-robot settings with flexible, language-conditioned task specifications remains limited. Furthermore, current diffusion-based approaches incur high computational cost during inference and struggle with generalization because they require explicit construction of environment representations and lack mechanisms for reasoning about geometric reachability. To address these limitations, we present Language-Conditioned Heat-Inspired Diffusion (LCHD), an end-to-end vision-based framework that generates language-conditioned, collision-free trajectories. LCHD integrates CLIP-based semantic priors with a collision-avoiding diffusion kernel serving as a physical inductive bias that enables the planner to interpret language commands strictly within the reachable workspace.

Our study focuses on two key questions: (1) understanding which evaluation aspects matter most to readers, and (2) exploring effective methods for evaluating lengthy stories. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark, LongStoryEval, comprising 600 newly published books with an average length of 121K tokens (maximum 397K). Each book includes its average rating and multiple reader reviews, presented as critiques organized by evaluation aspects. By analyzing all user-mentioned aspects, we propose an evaluation criteria structure and conduct experiments to identify the most significant aspects among the 8 top-level criteria. For evaluation methods, we compare the effectiveness of three types: aggregation-based, incremental-updated, and summary-based evaluations. Our findings reveal that aggregation- and summary-based evaluations perform better, with the former excelling in detail assessment and the latter offering greater efficiency. Building on these insights, we further propose NovelCritique, an 8B model that leverages the efficient summary-based framework to review and score stories across specified aspects. NovelCritique outperforms commercial models like GPT-4o in aligning with human evaluations.

This generalization is needed because, as I show, such probabilistic causal models arise even in simple settings. My semantics offer a natural compromize in the long-standing debate between Pearl and Dawid over counterfactuals: I agree with Dawid that universal causal determinism and unrealistic variables should be rejected, but I agree with Pearl that a general semantics of counterfactuals is nonetheless possible. I restrict attention to causal models that satisfy the Markov condition, only contain realistic variables, and are causally complete. Although I formulate my proposal using structural causal models, as does Pearl, I refrain from using so-called response variables. Moreover, I prove that my semantics is equivalent to two other recent proposals that do not involve structural causal models, and that it is in line with various comments on stochastic counterfactuals that have appeared in the literature more broadly.

Recent advances leverage conditional generative models together with adversarial training or mutual information-based regularization to balance data privacy and utility. However, these methods often require modifying the downstream task, struggle to achieve a satisfactory privacy-utility trade-off, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained mobile IoT devices. We propose Cloak, a novel data obfuscation framework based on latent diffusion models. In contrast to prior work, we employ contrastive learning to extract disentangled representations, which guide the latent diffusion process to retain useful information while concealing private information. This approach enables users with diverse privacy needs to navigate the privacy-utility trade-off with minimal retraining.

While visual methods have advanced rapidly, they often struggle under visually degraded conditions such as motion blur or occlusions. In this work, we show that passive scene sounds provide complementary cues for relative camera pose estimation for in-the-wild videos. We introduce a simple but effective audio-visual framework that integrates direction-ofarrival (DOA) spectra and binauralized embeddings into a state-of-the-art vision-only pose estimation model. Our results on two large datasets show consistent gains over strong visual baselines, plus robustness when the visual information is corrupted. To our knowledge, this represents the first work to successfully leverage audio for relative camera pose estimation in real-world videos, and it establishes incidental, everyday audio as an unexpected but promising signal for a classic spatial challenge.

When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization.

Existing commercial solutions often prioritize interactive user safety, enforcing authentication barriers that break the headless loops required for true autonomy. This paper presents a Fault-Tolerant Sandboxing framework designed to mitigate these risks through a policy-based interception layer and a transactional filesystem snapshot mechanism. We hypothesize that wrapping agent actions in atomic transactions can guarantee safety with acceptable latency, outperforming the heavy initialization overhead of containers or the interactive friction of commercial CLIs. We validated this approach by deploying the Minimind-MoE LLM served via nano-vllm on a custom Proxmox-based testbed utilizing EVPN/VXLAN isolation.

To address this, we propose SMRABooth, which leverages the self-supervised encoder and optical flow encoder to provide object-level subject and motion representations. These representations are aligned with the model during the LoRA fine-tuning process. Our approach is structured in three core stages: (1) We exploit subject representations via a self-supervised encoder to guide subject alignment, enabling the model to capture overall structure of subject and enhance high-level semantic consistency. (2) We utilize motion representations from an optical flow encoder to capture structurally coherent and object-level motion trajectories independent of appearance. (3) We propose a subject-motion association decoupling strategy that applies sparse LoRAs injection across both locations and timing, effectively reducing interference between subject and motion LoRAs.

While IL excels in matching expert behavior in open-loop settings by minimizing per-step prediction errors, its performance degrades unexpectedly in closed-loop due to the gradual accumulation of small, often imperceptible errors over time.Over successive planning cycles, these errors compound, potentially resulting in severe failures.Current research efforts predominantly rely on increasingly sophisticated network architectures or high-fidelity training datasets to enhance the robustness of IL planners against error accumulation, focusing on the state-level robustness at a single time point. However, autonomous driving is inherently a continuous-time process, and leveraging the temporal scale to enhance robustness may provide a new perspective for addressing this issue.To this end, we propose a method termed Sequence of Experts (SoE), a temporal alternation policy that enhances closed-loop performance without increasing model size or data requirements. Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSequence of Experts (SoE)\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u56e0\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728nuPlan\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5404\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f00\u73af\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u56e0\u5c0f\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5355\u65f6\u523b\u72b6\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSequence of Experts (SoE)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u5212\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuPlan\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSoE\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u6709\u88ab\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "SoE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\u3002"}}

Existing resources and standardized tools for these languages are limited. To address this, we propose a human-AI collaborative approach for building a multilingual legal terminology database, based on a multi-agent framework. This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations.

This paper introduces the Memory-Aware Retention Schema (MaRS), a novel framework for human-centered memory management in generative agents, coupled with six theoretically-grounded forgetting policies that balance performance, privacy, and computational efficiency. We present the Forgetful but Faithful Agent (FiFA) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses agent performance across narrative coherence, goal completion, social recall accuracy, privacy preservation, and cost efficiency. Through extensive experimentation involving 300 evaluation runs across multiple memory budgets and agent configurations, we demonstrate that our hybrid forgetting policy achieves superior performance (composite score: 0.911) while maintaining computational tractability and privacy guarantees. Our work establishes new benchmarks for memory-budgeted agent evaluation and provides practical guidelines for deploying generative agents in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive environments.

Such models generate multi-step forecasts either directly, by predicting the full horizon at once, or iteratively, by feeding back their own predictions at each step. In both cases, the multi-step forecasts are prone to errors. To address this, we propose a Predictor-Corrector mechanism where the Predictor is any learned time-series model and the Corrector is a neural controlled differential equation. The Predictor forecasts, and the Corrector predicts the errors of the forecasts. Adding these errors to the forecasts improves forecast performance. The proposed Corrector works with irregularly sampled time series and continuous- and discrete-time Predictors. Additionally, we introduce two regularization strategies to improve the extrapolation performance of the Corrector with accelerated training. We evaluate our Corrector with diverse Predictors, e.g., neural ordinary differential equations, Contiformer, and DLinear, on synthetic, physics simulation, and real-world forecasting datasets.

Thermal RGB Fusion for Micro-UAV", "summary": "This study introduces a lightweight perimeter tracking method designed for micro UAV teams operating over wildfire environments under limited bandwidth conditions. Thermal image frames generate coarse hot region masks through adaptive thresholding and morphological refinement, while RGB frames contribute edge cues and suppress texture related false detections using gradient based filtering. A rule level merging strategy selects boundary candidates and simplifies them via the Ramer Douglas Peucker algorithm. The system incorporates periodic beacons and an inertial feedback loop that maintains trajectory stability in the presence of GPS degradation. The guidance loop targets sub 50 ms latency on embedded System on Chip (SoC) platforms by constraining per frame pixel operations and precomputing gradient tables. Small scale simulations demonstrate reductions in average path length and boundary jitter compared to a pure edge tracking baseline, while maintaining environmental coverage measured through intersection merge analysis. Battery consumption and computational utilization confirm the feasibility of achieving 10, 15 m/s forward motion on standard micro platforms. This approach enables rapid deployment in the field, requiring robust sensing and minimal communications for emergency reconnaissance applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5fae\u5c0f\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f16\u961f\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u91ce\u706b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5468\u754c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u4e0eRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u7ea7\u8fb9\u754c\u878d\u5408\u3001\u60ef\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91ce\u706b\u5e94\u6025\u4fa6\u5bdf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5fae\u5c0f\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548cGPS\u4fe1\u53f7\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u6c42\u4f4e\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5468\u754c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u70ed\u56fe\u50cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u4e0e\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7ec6\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u70ed\u533a\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5229\u7528RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u68af\u5ea6\u6ee4\u6ce2\u63d0\u53d6\u8fb9\u7f18\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u7eb9\u7406\u8bef\u68c0\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u53d6\u8fb9\u754c\u5019\u9009\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u7528Ramer-Douglas-Peucker\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5468\u671f\u4fe1\u6807\u4e0e\u60ef\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u73af\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6bcf\u5e27\u50cf\u7d20\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u68af\u5ea6\u8868\u5b9e\u73b0<50ms\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fSoC\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6296\u52a8\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u96c6\u5408\u5e76\u5206\u6790\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u7535\u6c60\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5360\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u73b010\u201315 m/s\u524d\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u3001GPS\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91ce\u5916\u5e94\u6025\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5fae\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u5468\u754c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002"}}

As re-collecting demonstrations and retraining for each new hardware platform are prohibitively costly, we show that existing robot data can be augmented for transfer and generalization. The Open X-Embodiment (OXE) dataset, which aggregates demonstrations from over 60 robot datasets, has been widely used as the foundation for training generalist policies. However, it is highly imbalanced: the top four robot types account for over 85\\% of its real data, which risks overfitting to robot-scene combinations. We present AugE-Toolkit, a scalable robot augmentation pipeline, and OXE-AugE, a high-quality open-source dataset that augments OXE with 9 different robot embodiments. OXE-AugE provides over 4.4 million trajectories, more than triple the size of the original OXE. We conduct a systematic study of how scaling robot augmentation impacts cross-embodiment learning. Results suggest that augmenting datasets with diverse arms and grippers improves policy performance not only on the augmented robots, but also on unseen robots and even the original robots under distribution shifts. In physical experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art generalist policies such as OpenVLA and $\u03c0_0$ benefit from fine-tuning on OXE-AugE, improving success rates by 24-45% on previously unseen robot-gripper combinations across four real-world manipulation tasks.

The key technical breakthroughs of QwenLong-L1.5 are as follows: (1) Long-Context Data Synthesis Pipeline: We develop a systematic synthesis framework that generates challenging reasoning tasks requiring multi-hop grounding over globally distributed evidence. By deconstructing documents into atomic facts and their underlying relationships, and then programmatically composing verifiable reasoning questions, our approach creates high-quality training data at scale, moving substantially beyond simple retrieval tasks to enable genuine long-range reasoning capabilities. (2) Stabilized Reinforcement Learning for Long-Context Training: To overcome the critical instability in long-context RL, we introduce task-balanced sampling with task-specific advantage estimation to mitigate reward bias, and propose Adaptive Entropy-Controlled Policy Optimization (AEPO) that dynamically regulates exploration-exploitation trade-offs. (3) Memory-Augmented Architecture for Ultra-Long Contexts: Recognizing that even extended context windows cannot accommodate arbitrarily long sequences, we develop a memory management framework with multi-stage fusion RL training that seamlessly integrates single-pass reasoning with iterative memory-based processing for tasks exceeding 4M tokens. Based on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, QwenLong-L1.5 achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on long-context reasoning benchmarks, surpassing its baseline by 9.90 points on average. On ultra-long tasks (1M~4M tokens), QwenLong-L1.5's memory-agent framework yields a 9.48-point gain over the agent baseline.

Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06ILP\u7cfb\u7edfPyGol\u4e0eSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668Z3\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u6570\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u9608\u503c\u3001\u533a\u95f4\u548c\u591a\u5b57\u9762\u7b97\u672f\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfILP\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6570\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8c13\u8bcd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u8054\u5408\u6570\u503c\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u9608\u503c\u3001\u7b97\u672f\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06ILP\u7cfb\u7edfPyGol\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5019\u9009\u5b50\u53e5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027/\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5b9e\u6570\u7b97\u672f\u7b49\u80cc\u666f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u91cf\u8bcd\u81ea\u7531SMT\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7531Z3\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u542b\u6570\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86ILP\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5316SMT-ILP\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7406\u8bba\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u7eb3\u7684\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

MixtureKit automatically modifies the model configuration, patches decoder and causal LM classes, and saves a unified checkpoint ready for inference or fine-tuning. We further provide a visualization interface to inspect per-token routing decisions, expert weight distributions, and layer-wise contributions.

Submitted to Data in Brief (Elsevier)", "summary": "We present a large-scale, longitudinal visual dataset of urban streetlights captured by 22 fixed-angle cameras deployed across Bristol, U.K., from 2021 to 2025. The dataset contains over 526,000 images, collected hourly under diverse lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. Each image is accompanied by rich metadata, including timestamps, GPS coordinates, and device identifiers. This unique real-world dataset enables detailed investigation of visual drift, anomaly detection, and MLOps strategies in smart city deployments. To promtoe seconardary analysis, we additionally provide a self-supervised framework based on convolutional variational autoencoders (CNN-VAEs). Models are trained separately for each camera node and for day/night image sets. We define two per-sample drift metrics: relative centroid drift, capturing latent space deviation from a baseline quarter, and relative reconstruction error, measuring normalized image-domain degradation.

Model-based hierarchical controllers excel in laboratory settings, but suffer from limited generalization and overly conservative behaviors. End-to-end learning-based approaches unlock greater flexibility and adaptability, but existing state-of-the-art methods either rely on heightmaps that introduce noise and complex, costly pipelines, or implicitly infer terrain features from egocentric depth images, often missing accurate critical geometric cues and leading to inefficient learning and rigid gaits. To overcome these limitations, we propose START, a single-stage learning framework that enables agile, stable locomotion on highly sparse and randomized footholds. START leverages only low-cost onboard vision and proprioception to accurately reconstruct local terrain heightmap, providing an explicit intermediate representation to convey essential features relevant to sparse foothold regions. This supports comprehensive environmental understanding and precise terrain assessment, reducing exploration cost and accelerating skill acquisition. Experimental results demonstrate that START achieves zero-shot transfer across diverse real-world scenarios, showcasing superior adaptability, precise foothold placement, and robust locomotion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSTART\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u673a\u8f7d\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f foothold \u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u654f\u6377\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u8d70\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6b65\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff1b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u6d41\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u6216\u4ec5\u9760\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u5730\u5f62\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u952e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u6b65\u6001\u50f5\u786c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTART\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u8f7d\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u5730\u5f62\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6491\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u5f62\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "START\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u8db3\u843d\u70b9\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "START\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f foothold \u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce author labeling, an annotation technique where the writer of the document itself annotates the data at the moment of creation. We collaborate with a commercial chatbot with over 10,000 users to deploy an author labeling annotation system for subjective features related to product recommendation. This system identifies task-relevant queries, generates on-the-fly labeling questions, and records authors' answers in real time. We train and deploy an online-learning model architecture for product recommendation that continuously improves from author labeling and find it achieved a 534% increase in click-through rate compared to an industry advertising baseline running concurrently. We then compare the quality and practicality of author labeling to three traditional annotation approaches for sentiment analysis and find author labeling to be higher quality, faster to acquire, and cheaper. These findings reinforce existing literature that annotations, especially for egocentric and subjective beliefs, are significantly higher quality when labeled by the author rather than a third party.

Under a Tensor Gaussian Mixture Model, we propose high-dimensional CP low-rank Tensor Discriminant Analysis (CP-TDA) with Randomized Composite PCA (\\textsc{rc-PCA}) initialization, that is essential for handling dependent and anisotropic noise under weaker signal strength and incoherence conditions, followed by iterative refinement algorithm. We establish global convergence and minimax-optimal misclassification rates.\n  To handle tensor data deviating from tensor normality, we develop the first semiparametric tensor discriminant model, in which learned tensor representations are mapped via deep generative models into a latent space tailored for CP-TDA.

To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.\n  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR.

This paper presents an iterative learning framework for automatic tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) weighting matrices based on task-level performance feedback. Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm.

However, we find that existing methods suffer from a critical failure mode under long-horizon training: a \"policy collapse\" where performance precipitously degrades. We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faM-GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eIQR\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u957f\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5d29\u6e83\u4e0e\u71b5\u5feb\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7b56\u7565\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u52a0rollout\u6570\u91cf\u53ea\u80fd\u5ef6\u7f13\u800c\u975e\u907f\u514d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM-GRPO\uff08\u52a8\u91cf\u951a\u5b9a\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7f13\u6162\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u56db\u5206\u4f4d\u8ddd\uff08IQR\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5254\u9664\u4f4e\u71b5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cM-GRPO\u4e0eIQR\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u719f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b56\u7565\u5d29\u6e83\u4e0e\u71b5\u574d\u584c\u662f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u91cf\u951a\u5b9a\u4e0e\u71b5\u611f\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u7b5b\u9009\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bad\u7ec3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Low-rank bottleneck architectures offer a promising solution to significantly reduce the training time and memory footprint with minimum impact on accuracy. Despite algorithmic efficiency, bottleneck architectures scale poorly under standard tensor parallelism. Simply applying 3D parallelism designed for full-rank methods leads to excessive communication and poor GPU utilization. To address this limitation, we propose BOOST, an efficient training framework tailored for large-scale low-rank bottleneck architectures. BOOST introduces a novel Bottleneck-aware Tensor Parallelism, and combines optimizations such as online-RMSNorm, linear layer grouping, and low-rank activation checkpointing to achieve end-to-end training speedup. Evaluations on different low-rank bottleneck architectures demonstrate that BOOST achieves 1.46-1.91$\\times$ speedup over full-rank model baselines and 1.87-2.27$\\times$ speedup over low-rank model with naively integrated 3D parallelism, with improved GPU utilization and reduced communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBOOST\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f4e\u79e9\u74f6\u9888\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u74f6\u9888\u611f\u77e5\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u3001\u5728\u7ebfRMSNorm\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u4f4e\u79e9\u74f6\u9888\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c3D\u5e76\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u8fc7\u591a\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBOOST\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u74f6\u9888\u611f\u77e5\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\uff08Bottleneck-aware Tensor Parallelism\uff09\u3001\u5728\u7ebfRMSNorm\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5c42 grouping\u3001\u4f4e\u79e9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4e\u79e9\u74f6\u9888\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\uff0cBOOST\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u79e9\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u901f1.46\u20131.91\u00d7\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u96c6\u62103D\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u901f1.87\u20132.27\u00d7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "BOOST\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9\u74f6\u9888\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6269\u5c55\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f4e\u79e9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This study presents a novel deep learning pipeline for emotion recognition in autistic children in response to a name-calling event by a humanoid robot (NAO), under controlled experimental settings. The dataset comprises of around 50,000 facial frames extracted from video recordings of 15 children with ASD. A hybrid model combining a fine-tuned ResNet-50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a three-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) trained on both visual and geometric features extracted from MediaPipe FaceMesh landmarks. Emotions were probabilistically labeled using a weighted ensemble of two models: DeepFace's and FER, each contributing to soft-label generation across seven emotion classes. Final classification leveraged a fused embedding optimized via Kullback-Leibler divergence. The proposed method demonstrates robust performance in modeling subtle affective responses and offers significant promise for affective profiling of ASD children in clinical and therapeutic human-robot interaction contexts, as the pipeline effectively captures micro emotional cues in neurodivergent children, addressing a major gap in autism-specific HRI research.

Consequently, these algorithms typically exclude continuous but non-differentiable paths, such as piecewise functions. Despite this exclusion, such paths provide convenient high-level inputs for describing robot missions or behavior. While techniques such as spline interpolation or optimization-based methods are commonly used to smooth non-differentiable paths or create feasible ones from sequences of waypoints, they either can produce unnecessarily complex trajectories or are computationally expensive. In this work, we present a method to regularize non-differentiable functions and generate feasible paths through mollification. Specifically, we approximate an arbitrary path with a differentiable function that can converge to it with arbitrary precision. Additionally, we provide a systematic method for bounding the curvature of generated paths, which we demonstrate by applying it to paths resulting from linking a sequence of waypoints with segments.

Measuring Bargaining Capabilities of AI Negotiators", "comment": "Published in the First Workshop on Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models at Neurips 2025", "summary": "Bilateral negotiation is a complex, context-sensitive task in which human negotiators dynamically adjust anchors, pacing, and flexibility to exploit power asymmetries and informal cues. We introduce a unified mathematical framework for modeling concession dynamics based on a hyperbolic tangent curve, and propose two metrics burstiness tau and the Concession-Rigidity Index (CRI) to quantify the timing and rigidity of offer trajectories. We conduct a large-scale empirical comparison between human negotiators and four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across natural-language and numeric-offers settings, with and without rich market context, as well as six controlled power-asymmetry scenarios. Our results reveal that, unlike humans who smoothly adapt to situations and infer the opponents position and strategies, LLMs systematically anchor at extremes of the possible agreement zone for negotiations and optimize for fixed points irrespective of leverage or context. Qualitative analysis further shows limited strategy diversity and occasional deceptive tactics used by LLMs. Moreover the ability of LLMs to negotiate does not improve with better models. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current LLM negotiation capabilities and point to the need for models that better internalize opponent reasoning and context-dependent strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5207\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u8ba9\u6b65\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86burstiness tau\u548cConcession-Rigidity Index\uff08CRI\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8c08\u5224\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u951a\u5b9a\u6781\u7aef\u503c\u3001\u5ffd\u89c6\u6743\u529b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u5355\u4e00\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5347\u7ea7\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u8c08\u5224\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u8c08\u5224\u8005\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u951a\u70b9\u3001\u8282\u594f\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u6743\u529b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u8c08\u5224\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8ba9\u6b65\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u5b66\u523b\u753b\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5207\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8ba9\u6b65\u52a8\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u51faburstiness tau\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u8ba9\u6b65\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\uff09\u548cConcession-Rigidity Index\uff08CRI\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8ba9\u6b65\u521a\u6027\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5f00\u5c55\u6db5\u76d6\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00/\u6570\u503c\u62a5\u4ef7\u3001\u6709\u65e0\u5e02\u573a\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u516d\u79cd\u6743\u529b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "LLM\u666e\u904d\u5728\u534f\u8bae\u533a\u95f4\u4e24\u7aef\u951a\u5b9a\uff0c\u65e0\u89c6\u6760\u6746\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f18\u5316\u56fa\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u5076\u73b0\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u968f\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u6216\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u6539\u5584\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5219\u80fd\u5e73\u6ed1\u9002\u5e94\u60c5\u5883\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u5bf9\u624b\u7acb\u573a\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u53cc\u8fb9\u8c08\u5224\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5bf9\u624b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5185\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u65b9\u5fc3\u667a\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u8c08\u5224\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, in many real-world settings, such as educational tutoring or medical assistance, relevant information is not directly available and must be actively acquired through dynamic interactions. An interactive agent would recognize its own uncertainty, ask targeted questions, and retain new knowledge efficiently. Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students. We find that this guided training enables smaller models to learn how to ask better questions, further enhancing learning efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u751f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u95ee\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u95ee\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528DPO\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u95ee\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6559\u80b2\u8f85\u5bfc\u3001\u533b\u7597\u534f\u52a9\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e3b\u52a8\u83b7\u53d6\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6559\u5e08\u5982\u4f55\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5b66\u751f\u5982\u4f55\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5411\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u95ee\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b66\u751f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Direct Preference Optimization\uff08DPO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u6211\u6216\u66f4\u5f3a\u5b66\u751f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e26\u6765\u81f3\u5c110.5\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9Pass@k\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u7ecfDPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b66\u4f1a\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u751f\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u95ee\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5229\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Rabiee"], "title": "CineLOG: A Training Free Approach for Cinematic Long Video Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Controllable video synthesis is a central challenge in computer vision, yet current models struggle with fine grained control beyond textual prompts, particularly for cinematic attributes like camera trajectory and genre. Existing datasets often suffer from severe data imbalance, noisy labels, or a significant simulation to real gap. To address this, we introduce CineLOG, a new dataset of 5,000 high quality, balanced, and uncut video clips. Each entry is annotated with a detailed scene description, explicit camera instructions based on a standard cinematic taxonomy, and genre label, ensuring balanced coverage across 17 diverse camera movements and 15 film genres. We also present our novel pipeline designed to create this dataset, which decouples the complex text to video (T2V) generation task into four easier stages with more mature technology.

However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\\% in MDQA dataset.

Code available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/BaRISTA", "summary": "Intracranial recordings have opened a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure activity across multiregional networks in the human brain. Recent works have focused on developing transformer-based neurofoundation models of such recordings that can generalize across subjects and datasets. However, these recordings exhibit highly complex spatiotemporal interactions across diverse spatial scales, from the single-channel scale to the scale of brain regions. As such, there remain critical open questions regarding how best to encode spatial information and how to design self-supervision tasks that enable the learning of brain network patterns and enhance downstream decoding performance using such high-dimensional, multiregional recordings. To allow for exploring these questions, we propose a new spatiotemporal transformer model of multiregional neural activity and a corresponding self-supervised masked latent reconstruction task, designed to enable flexibility in the spatial scale used for token encoding and masking. Applying this model on publicly available multiregional intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG) data, we demonstrate that adjusting the spatial scale for both token encoding and masked reconstruction significantly impacts downstream decoding. Further, we find that spatial encoding at larger scales than channel-level encoding, which is commonly used in existing iEEG transformer models, improves downstream decoding performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our method allows for region-level token encoding while also maintaining accurate channel-level neural reconstruction. Taken together, our modeling framework enables exploration of the spatial scales used for token encoding and masking, reveals their importance towards self-supervised pretraining of neurofoundation models of multiregional human brain activity, and enhances downstream decoding performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u7a7aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u63a9\u7801\u6f5c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u533a\u57df\u9885\u5185\u8111\u7535\uff08iEEG\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u5355\u901a\u9053 vs \u8111\u533a\uff09\u5bf9token\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u533a\u57df\u9885\u5185\u8bb0\u5f55\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u5982\u4f55\u5408\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u8111\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u65f6\u7a7aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u9009\u62e9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884ctoken\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u63a9\u7801\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6f5c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u591a\u533a\u57dfiEEG\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u3001\u8111\u533a\u7ea7\u7b49\uff09\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u8c03\u6574token\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u5e38\u7528\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u8111\u533a\u7ea7\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u533a\u57df\u7ea7token\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u533a\u57df\u4eba\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEARS\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a5\u53d7\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u968f\u673a\u9608\u503c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5927\u91cf\u5408\u7406\u5019\u9009\u8bcd\u88ab\u968f\u673a\u62d2\u7edd\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff08EARS\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff081\u2212max(P_target)\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a5\u53d7\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cEARS\u4f7f\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534718.12%\uff0cGSM8K\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d0.84%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "EARS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u62d2\u7edd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5bf9\u5815\u80ce\u6c61\u540d\u8fd9\u4e00\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u4eba\u9645\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5c42\u9762\u5747\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ec5\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bed\u8a00\u6070\u5f53\u6027\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u5fc3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u5728AI\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u4e25\u683c\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4ecb\u5165\u88ab\u6c61\u540d\u5316\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u5982\u5815\u80ce\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u4e0e\u751f\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u8a00\u8bf4\u81ea\u8eab\u5904\u5883\u65f6\uff0cAI\u80fd\u5426\u2018\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u53ef\u8a00\u8bf4\u4e4b\u7269\u2019\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u5815\u80ce\u6c61\u540d\u91cf\u8868\uff08ILAS\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9627\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u7269\uff0c\u57285\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\uff08\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u5224\uff09\u3001\u4eba\u9645\u5c42\uff08\u9884\u671f\u8bc4\u5224\u4e0e\u5b64\u7acb\u611f\uff09\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\uff08\u793e\u533a\u8c34\u8d23\u4e0e\u62ab\u9732\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u53ca\u6574\u4f53\u6c61\u540d\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u672a\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u68c0\u9a8c\uff1a\u9ad8\u4f30\u4eba\u9645\u6c61\u540d\u3001\u4f4e\u4f30\u8ba4\u77e5\u6c61\u540d\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u793e\u533a\u8c34\u8d23\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u5b66\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u7684\u2018\u6c61\u540d\u2014\u4fdd\u5bc6\u2019\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u81ea\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u8a00\u5f97\u4f53\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u969c\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406/\u751f\u7406\u6784\u5ff5\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5065\u5eb7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u4ee5\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u3001\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u76d1\u7ba1\u5236\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u9762\u5411\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684AI\u7d20\u517b\u6559\u80b2\u3002"}}

However, current implementations rely on recurrent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) backbones and single-step training objectives, which limit their ability to capture long-range dependencies and produce coherent forecast trajectories across lead times. To address these limitations, we developed HydroDiffusion, a diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework with a decoder-only state space model backbone. The proposed framework jointly denoises full multi-day trajectories in a single pass, ensuring temporal coherence and mitigating error accumulation common in autoregressive prediction. HydroDiffusion is evaluated across 531 watersheds in the contiguous United States (CONUS) in the CAMELS dataset. We benchmark HydroDiffusion against two diffusion baselines with LSTM backbones, as well as the recently proposed Diffusion-based Runoff Model (DRUM). Results show that HydroDiffusion achieves strong nowcast accuracy when driven by observed meteorological forcings, and maintains consistent performance across the full simulation horizon. Moreover, HydroDiffusion delivers stronger deterministic and probabilistic forecast skill than DRUM in operational forecasting. These results establish HydroDiffusion as a robust generative modeling framework for medium-range streamflow forecasting, providing both a new modeling benchmark and a foundation for future research on probabilistic hydrologic prediction at continental scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHydroDiffusion\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6c34\u6587\u6982\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u5668-only\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8054\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u591a\u65e5\u6d41\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709LSTM\u57fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548cDRUM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f84\u6d41\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56LSTM\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u5355\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u9884\u89c1\u671f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHydroDiffusion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528decoder-only\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3LSTM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8054\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u65e5\u6d41\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728CONUS 531\u4e2a\u6d41\u57df\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cHydroDiffusion\u5728\u5b9e\u6d4b\u6c14\u8c61\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u5177\u5907\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u62a5\uff08nowcast\uff09\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5168\u9884\u89c1\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u62a5\u6280\u80fd\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eDRUM\u53caLSTM\u57fa\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "HydroDiffusion\u4e3a\u4e2d\u77ed\u671f\u5f84\u6d41\u6982\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5927\u9646\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6c34\u6587\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This is typically achieved by transferring visual-attribute relationships from seen classes to unseen classes. The core challenge is attribute entanglement, where conventional models collapse distinct attributes like color, shape, and texture into a single visual embedding. This causes interference that masks these critical distinctions. The post-hoc solutions of previous work are insufficient, as they operate on representations that are already mixed. We propose a zero-shot learning framework that learns AttributeCentric Representations (ACR) to tackle this problem by imposing attribute disentanglement during representation learning. ACR is achieved with two mixture-of-experts components, including Mixture of Patch Experts (MoPE) and Mixture of Attribute Experts (MoAE). First, MoPE is inserted into the transformer using a dual-level routing mechanism to conditionally dispatch image patches to specialized experts.

Navigation serves as a crucial technical foundation for accomplishing complex tasks. However, navigating AMRs in dense, cluttered, and semi-structured environments remains challenging, primarily due to nonholonomic vehicle dynamics, interactions with mixed static/dynamic obstacles, and the non-convex constrained nature of such operational spaces. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an Improved Sequential Model Predictive Control (ISMPC) navigation framework that systematically reformulates navigation tasks as sequential switched optimal control problems. The framework addresses the aforementioned challenges through two key innovations: 1) Implementation of a Multi-Directional Safety Rectangular Corridor (MDSRC) algorithm, which encodes the free space through rectangular convex regions to avoid collision with static obstacles, eliminating redundant computational burdens and accelerating solver convergence; 2) A sequential MPC navigation framework that integrates corridor constraints with barrier function constraints is proposed to achieve static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The ISMPC navigation framework enables direct velocity generation for AMRs, simplifying traditional navigation algorithm architectures. Comparative experiments demonstrate the framework's superiority in free-space utilization ( an increase of 41.05$\\%$ in the average corridor area) while maintaining real-time computational performance (average corridors generation latency of 3 ms).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08ISMPC\uff09\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u77e9\u5f62\u8d70\u5eca\uff08MDSRC\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u878d\u5408\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217MPC\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0AMR\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "AMR\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u6742\u4e71\u3001\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u52a8\u9759\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ca\u975e\u51f8\u7ea6\u675f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faISMPC\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528MDSRC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u77e9\u5f62\u51f8\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u89c4\u907f\u9759\u6001\u969c\u788d\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u96c6\u6210\u8d70\u5eca\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u969c\u788d\u51fd\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217MPC\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u8ba9\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5229\u7528\u738741.05%\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u8d70\u5eca\u9762\u79ef\uff09\uff0c\u8d70\u5eca\u751f\u6210\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ec53ms\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ISMPC\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0bAMR\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5bfc\u822a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5de5\u4e1a\u843d\u5730\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing approaches assume a fixed inventory of tools, limiting LLM agents' adaptability to new or evolving toolsets. We present AutoTool, a framework that equips LLM agents with dynamic tool-selection capabilities throughout their reasoning trajectories. We first construct a 200k dataset with explicit tool-selection rationales across 1,000+ tools and 100+ tasks spanning mathematics, science, code generation, and multimodal reasoning. Building on this data foundation, AutoTool employs a dual-phase optimization pipeline: (i) supervised and RL-based trajectory stabilization for coherent reasoning, and (ii) KL-regularized Plackett-Luce ranking to refine consistent multi-step tool selection. Across ten diverse benchmarks, we train two base models, Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, with AutoTool. With fewer parameters, AutoTool consistently outperforms advanced LLM agents and tool-integration methods, yielding average gains of 6.4% in math & science reasoning, 4.5% in search-based QA, 7.7% in code generation, and 6.9% in multimodal understanding.

While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition.

Recent advances in computer vision introduced a range of new guidance strategies for generative models, many of which can be adapted to support these goals. In this work, we integrate state-of-the-art guidance methods -- including classifier-free guidance, autoguidance, and model guidance -- in a leading molecule generation framework built on an SE(3)-equivariant flow matching process. We propose a hybrid guidance strategy that separately guides continuous and discrete molecular modalities -- operating on velocity fields and predicted logits, respectively -- while jointly optimizing their guidance scales via Bayesian optimization. Our implementation, benchmarked on the QM9 and QMe14S datasets, achieves new state-of-the-art performance in property alignment for de novo molecular generation. The generated molecules also exhibit high structural validity. Furthermore, we systematically compare the strengths and limitations of various guidance methods, offering insights into their broader applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eSE(3)-\u4e0d\u53d8\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\uff08\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff09\u548c\u79bb\u6563\uff08logits\uff09\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u5408\u8c03\u6574\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728QM9\u548cQMe14S\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06classifier-free guidance\u3001autoguidance\u548cmodel guidance\u96c6\u6210\u5230SE(3)-equivariant flow matching\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\uff08\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff09\u548c\u79bb\u6563\uff08\u9884\u6d4blogits\uff09\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u7c7b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728QM9\u548cQMe14S\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u8d28\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6784/\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u7c7b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u4f18\u52a3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff1b\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e76\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

To quantify the progress, we introduce ProImage-Bench, a rubric-based benchmark that targets biology schematics, engineering/patent drawings, and general scientific diagrams. For 654 figures collected from real textbooks and technical reports, we construct detailed image instructions and a hierarchy of rubrics that decompose correctness into 6,076 criteria and 44,131 binary checks. Rubrics are derived from surrounding text and reference figures using large multimodal models, and are evaluated by an automated LMM-based judge with a principled penalty scheme that aggregates sub-question outcomes into interpretable criterion scores. We benchmark several representative text-to-image models on ProImage-Bench and find that, despite strong open-domain performance, the best base model reaches only 0.791 rubric accuracy and 0.553 criterion score overall, revealing substantial gaps in fine-grained scientific fidelity. Finally, we show that the same rubrics provide actionable supervision: feeding failed checks back into an editing model for iterative refinement boosts a strong generator from 0.653 to 0.865 in rubric accuracy and from 0.388 to 0.697 in criterion score. ProImage-Bench thus offers both a rigorous diagnostic for professional image generation and a scalable signal for improving specification-faithful scientific illustrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ProImage-Bench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u4e13\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff08\u5982\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u793a\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u56fe\u7eb8\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b654\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u6280\u672f\u56fe\u50cf\u30016076\u6761\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6807\u51c6\u548c44131\u9879\u4e8c\u5143\u68c0\u67e5\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7LMM\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u5229\u7528\u5931\u8d25\u68c0\u67e5\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7f16\u8f91\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaProImage-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u6536\u96c6\u771f\u5b9e\u6559\u6750\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u7684654\u5f20\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u56fe\u50cf\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u542b6076\u6761\u6807\u51c6\u300144131\u9879\u4e8c\u5143\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8eLMM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u88c1\u5224\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u5931\u8d25\u68c0\u67e5\u53cd\u9988\u81f3\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728ProImage-Bench\u4e0a\u6574\u4f53rubric\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec50.791\u3001criterion\u5f97\u5206\u4ec50.553\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5931\u8d25\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\uff0c\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684rubric\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece0.653\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.865\uff0ccriterion\u5f97\u5206\u4ece0.388\u5347\u81f30.697\u3002", "conclusion": "ProImage-Bench\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e13\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63d2\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

The framework integrates kinematic boundary conditions, such as potential part collisions, to guarantee the feasibility of automated assembly planning. The developed algorithm computes all feasible production sequences, integrating modules for detecting spatial relationships and formulating geometric constraints. The algorithm incorporates additional attributes, including handling feasibility, tolerance matching, and joint compatibility, to manage the high combinatorial complexity inherent in assembly sequence generation. Heuristics, such as Single-Piece Flow assembly and geometrical constraint enforcement, are utilized to further refine the solution space, facilitating more efficient planning for complex assemblies. The PLP stage is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), balancing the total times of a fixed number of manufacturing stations.

Existing data selection methods, ranging from manual curation to heuristics based on length, entropy, or overall loss, fail to capture the causal importance of individual reasoning steps, limiting distillation efficiency. To address this, we propose Attention Influence for Reasoning (AIR), a principled, unsupervised and training-free framework that leverages mechanistic insights of the retrieval head to select high-value post-training data. AIR first identifies reasoning-critical attention heads of an off-the-shelf model, then constructs a weakened reference model with disabled head influence, and finally quantifies the resulting loss divergence as the Attention Influence Score. This score enables fine-grained assessment at both the step and sample levels, supporting step-level weighted fine-tuning and global sample selection. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that AIR consistently improves reasoning accuracy, surpassing heuristic baselines and effectively isolating the most critical steps and samples.

Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpeakRL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4e92\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u9002\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5bf9\u8bdd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6SpeakER\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u5411\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e3b\u52a8\u6f84\u6e05\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u6b67\u4e49\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpeakRL\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u9f13\u52b1\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u95ee\uff1b\u6784\u5efaSpeakER\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u9700\u4ea4\u4e92\u6f84\u6e05\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e73\u8861\u2018\u63d0\u95ee\u2019\u4e0e\u2018\u6267\u884c\u2019\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u534720.14%\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6b21\u672a\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5\u6f84\u6e05\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u517c\u5177\u2018\u6267\u884c\u8005\u2019\u4e0e\u2018\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8005\u2019\u53cc\u91cd\u89d2\u8272\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce EEG-DLite, a data distillation framework that enables more efficient pre-training by selectively removing noisy and redundant samples from large EEG datasets. EEG-DLite begins by encoding EEG segments into compact latent representations using a self-supervised autoencoder, allowing sample selection to be performed efficiently and with reduced sensitivity to noise. Based on these representations, EEG-DLite filters out outliers and minimizes redundancy, resulting in a smaller yet informative subset that retains the diversity essential for effective foundation model training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training on only 5 percent of a 2,500-hour dataset curated with EEG-DLite yields performance comparable to, and in some cases better than, training on the full dataset across multiple downstream tasks.

However, ongoing myelination and reduced tissue contrast make automated segmentation particularly challenging. This study systematically compared segmentation accuracy and its impact on volumetric and fractal dimension (FD) estimates in infant brain MRI using the Baby Open Brains (BOB) dataset (71 scans, 1-9 months). Two methods, SynthSeg and SamSeg, were evaluated against expert annotations using Dice, Intersection over Union, 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information. SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg across all quality metrics (mean Dice > 0.8 for major regions) and provided volumetric estimates closely matching the manual reference (mean +4% [-28% - 71%]). SamSeg systematically overestimated ventricular and whole-brain volumes (mean +76% [-12% - 190%]). Segmentation accuracy improved with age, consistent with increasing tissue contrast during myelination. Fractal dimension a(FD) nalyses revealed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement indicated that segmentation-related FD variability exceeded most group differences reported in developmental cohorts. Volume and FD deviations were positively correlated across structures, indicating that segmentation bias directly affects FD estimation. Overall, SynthSeg provided the most reliable volumetric and FD results for paediatric MRI, yet small morphological differences in volume and FD should be interpreted with caution due to segmentation-related uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86SynthSeg\u548cSamSeg\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5a74\u513f\u8111MRI\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u5206\u5f62\u7ef4\u6570(FD)\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SynthSeg\u5728\u5404\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eSamSeg\uff0c\u662f\u513f\u79d1MRI\u4e2d\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u5272\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ecd\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u5bf9\u5f85\u3002", "motivation": "\u5a74\u513f\u8111MRI\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u53d1\u80b2\u53d8\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u9ad3\u9798\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u5272\u7279\u522b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Baby Open Brains (BOB) \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0871\u6b21\u626b\u63cf\uff0c1-9\u4e2a\u6708\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86SynthSeg\u548cSamSeg\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ecDice\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd4\u300195%\u767e\u5206\u4f4dHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u5206\u5f62\u7ef4\u6570(FD)\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "SynthSeg\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eSamSeg\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u533a\u57df\u5e73\u5747Dice > 0.8\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4f53\u79ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u53c2\u8003\u7ed3\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1\uff08\u5e73\u5747+4% [-28% - 71%]\uff09\uff1b\u800cSamSeg\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9ad8\u4f30\u8111\u5ba4\u548c\u5168\u8111\u4f53\u79ef\uff08\u5e73\u5747+76% [-12% - 190%]\uff09\u3002\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u589e\u957f\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14FD\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u76f8\u5173FD\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53d1\u80b2\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u7ec4\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "SynthSeg\u4e3a\u513f\u79d1MRI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u548cFD\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5c0f\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f53\u79ef\u548cFD\u504f\u5dee\u5e94\u8c28\u614e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

While imitation learning models generate realistic trajectories, they often inherit biases from datasets dominated by safe demonstrations, limiting robustness in safety-critical cases. Moreover, most studies rely on open-loop evaluation, overlooking compounding errors in closed-loop execution. We address these limitations with two complementary strategies. First, we propose Group Relative Behavior Optimization (GRBO), a reinforcement learning post-training method that fine-tunes pretrained behavior models via group relative advantage maximization with human regularization. Using only 10% of the training dataset, GRBO improves safety performance by over 40% while preserving behavioral realism. Second, we introduce Warm-K, a warm-started Top-K sampling strategy that balances consistency and diversity in motion selection. Our Warm-K method-based test-time scaling enhances behavioral consistency and reactivity at test time without retraining, mitigating covariate shift and reducing performance discrepancies.

We propose Optimized Learned Count-Min Sketch (OptLCMS), which partitions the input domain and assigns each partition to its own CMS instance, with CMS parameters analytically derived for fixed thresholds, and thresholds optimized via dynamic programming with approximate feasibility checks. This reduces the need for empirical validation, enabling faster construction while providing theoretical guarantees under these assumptions. OptLCMS also allows explicit control of the allowable error threshold, improving flexibility in practice. Experiments show that OptLCMS builds faster, achieves lower intolerable error probability, and matches the estimation accuracy of LCMS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OptLCMS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60Count-Min Sketch\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u5212\u5206\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfcCMS\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5feb\u6784\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Learned Count-Min Sketch\uff08LCMS\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6784\u9020\u6162\uff08\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8c03\u53c2\uff09\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bb9\u5fcd\u8bef\u5dee\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "OptLCMS\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u57df\u5206\u914d\u72ec\u7acbCMS\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b\u5404CMS\u53c2\u6570\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\uff1b\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOptLCMS\u76f8\u6bd4LCMS\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bb9\u5fcd\u8bef\u5dee\u6982\u7387\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u540c\u7b49\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "OptLCMS\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u5141\u8bb8\u8bef\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing frameworks typically rely on large pretrained encoders (e.g., VAEs or tokenizer-based models) and perform transform coding within their generative latent space. While these approaches achieve impressive perceptual fidelity, their reliance on heavy encoder networks makes them unsuitable for deployment on weak sender devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility of applying shallow encoders for ultra-low bitrate compression and propose a novel Asymmetric Extreme Image Compression (AEIC) framework that pursues simultaneously encoding simplicity and decoding quality. Specifically, AEIC employs moderate or even shallow encoder networks, while leveraging an one-step diffusion decoder to maintain high-fidelity and high-realism reconstructions under extreme bitrates. To further enhance the efficiency of shallow encoders, we design a dual-side feature distillation scheme that transfers knowledge from AEIC with moderate encoders to its shallow encoder variants. Experiments demonstrate that AEIC not only outperforms existing methods on rate-distortion-perception performance at ultra-low bitrates, but also delivers exceptional encoding efficiency for 35.8 FPS on 1080P input images, while maintaining competitive decoding speed compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6781\u7aef\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\uff08AEIC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6d45\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\uff08<0.05 bpp\uff09\u4e0b\u517c\u987e\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u5347\u6d45\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u53d1\u9001\u7aef\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAEIC\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u4e2d\u7b49\u6216\u6d45\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u7f16\u7801\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4fdd\u969c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u5411\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u4e2d\u7b49\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u6d45\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\uff0cAEIC\u5728\u7387-\u5931\u771f-\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7f16\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe35.8 FPS\uff081080P\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d45\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u538b\u7f29\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose the Lightweight Actuation-Space Energy Modeling (LASEM) framework for CDCRs, which formulates actuation potential energy directly in actuation space to enable lightweight yet accurate dynamic modeling. Through a unified variational derivation, the governing dynamics reduce to a single partial differential equation (PDE), requiring only the Euler moment balance while implicitly incorporating the Newton force balance. By also avoiding explicit computation of cable-backbone contact forces, the formulation simplifies the model structure and improves computational efficiency while preserving geometric accuracy and physical consistency. Importantly, the proposed framework for dynamic modeling natively supports both force-input and displacement-input actuation modes, a capability seldom achieved in existing dynamic formulations.

However, the standard DPO formulation, in which both the chosen and rejected responses are generated by the same policy, suffers from a weak learning signal because the two responses often share similar errors and exhibit small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm.

Other works use generative Multimodal LLM (MLLM) to predict moments and/or highlights as text timestamps, utilizing its reasoning capability. While effective, text-based generation cannot provide direct gradients for frame-level predictions because the model only emits language tokens. Although recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods attempt to address the issue, we propose a novel approach by applying segmentation objectives directly on the LLM's output tokens. The LLM is fed with a fixed number of frames alongside a prompt that enforces it to output a sequence of continuous \"0\" and/or \"1\" characters, with one character per frame. The \"0\"/\"1\" characters benefit from the LLM's inherent language capability while also acting as background and foreground probabilities, respectively. Training employs segmentation losses on the probabilities alongside a normal causal LM loss. At inference, beam search generates sequence and logits, acting as moments and saliency scores, respectively. Despite sampling only 25 frames -- less than half of comparable methods -- our method achieved strong highlight detection (56.74 HIT@1) on QVHighlights.

While RL offers a promising paradigm, the inherent unpredictability and often uncooperative dynamics of pedestrian behavior pose substantial challenges, particularly concerning the efficiency of coordinated exploration among robots. To address this, we propose a novel coordinated-exploration multi-robot RL algorithm introducing an intrinsic motivation exploration. Its core component is a self-learning intrinsic reward mechanism designed to collectively alleviate policy conservatism. Moreover, this algorithm incorporates a dual-sampling mode within the centralized training and decentralized execution framework to enhance the representation of both the navigation policy and the intrinsic reward, leveraging a two-time-scale update rule to decouple parameter updates. Empirical results on social formation navigation benchmarks demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across crucial metrics.

All datasets are converted to HuggingFace Datasets, which include both cloze and multiple-choice prompt formulations with five variants per task, and we incorporate human annotation or review for machine-translated resources such as GoldenSwag and XED. To select robust tasks, we pretrain a set of 2.15B-parameter decoder-only models and use their learning curves to compute monotonicity, signal-to-noise, non-random performance, and model ordering consistency, retaining only tasks that satisfy all criteria.

However, there is currently a lack of high-quality datasets specifically designed to evaluate the ability of large multi-modal models (LMMs) to discover medical insights. In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations. Our analysis indicates that existing LMMs exhibit limited performance on MedInsightBench, which is primarily attributed to their challenges in extracting multi-step, deep insights and the absence of medical expertise. Therefore, we propose MedInsightAgent, an automated agent framework for medical data analysis, composed of three modules: Visual Root Finder, Analytical Insight Agent, and Follow-up Question Composer. Experiments on MedInsightBench highlight pervasive challenges and demonstrate that MedInsightAgent can improve the performance of general LMMs in medical data insight discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MedInsightBench\u2014\u2014\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5c42\u4e34\u5e8a\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86MedInsightAgent\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e13\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5c42\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b332\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6807\u6ce8\u533b\u5b66\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6MedInsightBench\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6MedInsightAgent\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c6\u89c9\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\uff08Visual Root Finder\uff09\u3001\u5206\u6790\u6027\u6d1e\u5bdf\u4ee3\u7406\uff08Analytical Insight Agent\uff09\u548c\u968f\u8bbf\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08Follow-up Question Composer\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709LMMs\u5728MedInsightBench\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800cMedInsightAgent\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6d1e\u5bdf\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MedInsightBench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6d1e\u5bdf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0cMedInsightAgent\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LMMs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this work we investigate the use of a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) in which the low-fidelity model is such a machine learning surrogate model, instead of a traditional low-resolution or reduced-order model. The idea behind this is to use an ensemble of a few expensive full model runs, together with an ensemble of many cheap but less accurate ML model runs. In this way we hope to reach increased accuracy within the same computational budget. We investigate the performance by testing the approach on two common test problems, namely the Lorenz-2005 model and the Quasi-Geostrophic model. By keeping the original physical model in place, we obtain a higher accuracy than when we completely replace it by the ML model. Furthermore, the MF-EnKF reaches improved accuracy within the same computational budget. The ML surrogate has similar or improved accuracy compared to the low-resolution one, but it can provide a larger speed-up. Our method contributes to increasing the effective ensemble size in the EnKF, which improves the estimation of the initial condition and hence accuracy of the predictions in fields such as meteorology and oceanography.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u96c6\u5408\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08MF-EnKF\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5168\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\u4e0e\u5927\u91cf\u5ec9\u4ef7\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684ML\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Lorenz-2005\u548c\u51c6\u5730\u8f6c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6216\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u7684ML\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u73b0\u5b9e\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5c06ML\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u96c6\u5408\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08MF-EnKF\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u91cf\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771fML\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "MF-EnKF\u5728Lorenz-2005\u548c\u51c6\u5730\u8f6c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u7eaf\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u578b\uff1bML\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u6548\u96c6\u5408\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06ML\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165MF-EnKF\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6c14\u8c61\u5b66\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u5b66\u7b49\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u6709\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) mitigates this issue by adapting prompts with fixed augmentations, which may falter in more challenging settings. In this work, we propose Meta Test-Time Prompt Tuning (MetaTPT), a meta-learning framework that learns a self-supervised auxiliary task to guide test-time prompt tuning. The auxiliary task dynamically learns parameterized augmentations for each sample, enabling more expressive transformations that capture essential features in target domains. MetaTPT adopts a dual-loop optimization paradigm: an inner loop learns a self-supervised task that generates informative views, while the outer loop performs prompt tuning by enforcing consistency across these views. By coupling augmentation learning with prompt tuning, MetaTPT improves test-time adaptation under domain shifts.

We show the inclusiveness and the robustness of the proposed framework through various challenging and agile behaviors such as running through randomly generated stepping stones, jumping over random obstacles, performing slalom motions, changing the running direction suddenly with a random leg, and rejecting significant disturbances and uncertainties through the MuJoCo physics simulator. We also perform additional simulations under a comprehensive set of uncertainties and noise to better justify the proposed method's robustness to real-world challenges, including signal noise, imprecision, modeling errors, and delays. All the aforementioned behaviors are performed with a single library and the same set of WBC control parameters without additional tuning. The spring-mass and the deadbeat control gain library are automatically computed in 4.5 seconds in total for 315 different trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5f39\u7c27-\u8d28\u5757\uff08spring-mass\uff09\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6b65\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6b7b\u533a\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u5e93\u4e0e\u5168\u8eab\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\uff08WBC\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8de8\u77f3\u3001\u8d8a\u969c\u3001\u7ed5\u6869\u3001\u6025\u8f6c\u5411\u3001\u6297\u6270\uff09\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u4eff\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u654f\u6377\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u514b\u670d\u5efa\u6a21\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6267\u884c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u6bcf\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u5355\u72ec\u8c03\u53c2\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u5f39\u7c27-\u8d28\u5757\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e93\u548c\u6b7b\u533a\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u5e93\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u677f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u95ed\u94fe\u3001\u9632\u78b0\u649e\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u6446\u817f\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4eff\u4eba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MuJoCo\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u8e0f\u77f3\u8dd1\u3001\u8d8a\u969c\u8df3\u3001\u7ed5\u6869\u3001\u7a81\u53d1\u8f6c\u5411\u3001\u5f3a\u6270\u52a8\u6291\u5236\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e93\u4e0eWBC\u53c2\u6570\uff1b315\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5e93\u751f\u6210\u603b\u8017\u65f6\u4ec54.5\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eff\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u65f6\u654f\u6377\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

(2) Comparative experiments were conducted using a dynamic charge/discharge dataset of Panasonic 18650PF batteries under multi-temperature conditions (from -10$^{\\circ}$C to 20$^{\\circ}$C).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6570\u9636\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcFDIFF-PINN\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60SOC\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u9636\u7b49\u6548\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5206\u6570\u9636\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u6570\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08FDIFF-PINN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6e29\u5ea6\uff08-10\u00b0C\u81f320\u00b0C\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u5145\u653e\u7535\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Panasonic 18650PF\u7535\u6c60\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86FDIFF-PINN\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FDIFF-PINN\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6c60SOC\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u5bbd\u6e29\u57df\u5de5\u51b5\u3002"}}

Facial expression recognition (FER) provides a primary channel for inferring affective states, but the dynamic and culturally nuanced nature of emotions requires models that can learn continuously without forgetting prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework for FER in a continual learning setting that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Our approach integrates two complementary modalities: deep convolutional features and facial Action Units (AUs) derived from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The combined representation is modelled through Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMMs), which provide a lightweight, probabilistic solution that avoids retraining while offering strong discriminative power. Using the Compound Facial Expression of Emotion (CFEE) dataset, we show that our model can first learn basic expressions and then progressively recognize compound expressions. Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy, stronger knowledge retention, and reduced forgetting. This framework contributes to the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems with applications in education, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff08FER\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eFACS\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5355\u5143\uff08AUs\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08BGMM\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6982\u7387\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CFEE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u53ca\u590d\u5408\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff08FER\uff09\u662f\u63a8\u65ad\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5173\u952e\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u4f46\u60c5\u7eea\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\u800c\u4e0d\u9057\u5fd8\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u4e0eFACS\u884d\u751f\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u5355\u5143\uff08AUs\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08BGMM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728CFEE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u672c\u8868\u60c5\u518d\u9010\u6b65\u8bc6\u522b\u590d\u5408\u8868\u60c5\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u5907\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684FER\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

The complex dynamics and non-linear characteristics of the TRAS make it challenging to control using traditional control algorithms. However, recent developments in RL have attracted interest due to their potential applications in the control of multirotors. The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm was used in this paper to train the RL agent. This algorithm is used for environments with continuous state and action spaces, similar to the TRAS, as it does not require a model of the system. The simulation results illustrated the effectiveness of the RL control method. Next, external disturbances in the form of wind disturbances were used to test the controller's effectiveness compared to conventional PID controllers. Lastly, experiments on a laboratory setup were carried out to confirm the controller's effectiveness in real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528TD3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u53cc\u65cb\u7ffc\u6c14\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08TRAS\uff09\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u6297\u98ce\u6270\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u5b9e\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "TRAS\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\uff1b\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u591a\u65cb\u7ffc\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22RL\u5728TRAS\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u73b0\u5b9e\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u53cc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\uff08TD3\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b8c\u6210TRAS\u7684\u5b9a\u70b9\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5728\u52a0\u5165\u98ce\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5RL\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9aTRAS\u5e76\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u5728\u98ce\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f18\u4e8ePID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff1b\u5b9e\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TD3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684TRAS\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u53ca\u6297\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While several studies have explored how LLMs can generate or solve optimization models, far less is understood about what these models actually learn regarding problem structure or algorithmic behavior. This study investigates how LLMs internally represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether such representations can support downstream decision tasks. We adopt a twofold methodology combining direct querying, which assesses LLM capacity to explicitly extract instance features, with probing analyses that examine whether such information is implicitly encoded within their hidden layers. The probing framework is further extended to a per-instance algorithm selection task, evaluating whether LLM-derived representations can predict the best-performing solver.

While recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often function as iterative optimizers within a search loop, rather than generating architectures directly from a holistic understanding of the data. To address this gap, we propose Cognitive-YOLO, a novel framework for LLM-driven architecture synthesis that generates network configurations directly from the intrinsic characteristics of the dataset. Our method consists of three stages: first, an analysis module extracts key meta-features (e.g., object scale distribution and scene density) from the target dataset; second, the LLM reasons upon these features, augmented with state-of-the-art components retrieved via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to synthesize the architecture into a structured Neural Architecture Description Language (NADL); finally, a compiler instantiates this description into a deployable model. Extensive experiments on five diverse object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cognitive-YOLO consistently generates superior architectures, achieving highly competitive performance and demonstrating a superior performance-per-parameter trade-off compared to strong baseline models across multiple benchmarks.

However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d851000\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u7b49\u654833.6\u4e07H800\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Python\uff09\u6bd4\u7f16\u8bd1\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Rust\uff09\u66f4\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u5173\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u8d851000\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u8986\u76d60.2B\u201314B\u53c2\u6570\u30011T token\u6570\u636e\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u8bed\u8a00\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u63a2\u7a76\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u884c\u914d\u5bf9\uff08\u4ee3\u7801+\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89e3\u91ca\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Python\uff09\u6bd4\u7f16\u8bd1\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Rust\uff09\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff1b\u8bed\u6cd5\u76f8\u8fd1\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\uff08\u5982JS/TS\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u534f\u540c\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u5e73\u884c\u914d\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7b97\u529b\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u8bed\u8a00\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u5404\u8bed\u8a00\u7f29\u653e\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6548\u7528\u3001\u534f\u540c\u6027\u548c\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001token\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We release our code and model at https://github.com/sitaocheng/DERL", "summary": "The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the \"meta-gradient\" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08DERL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5143\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u539f\u5b50\u5956\u52b1\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u5185\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u4fe1\u53f7\u66f4\u65b0\u5143\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5f0f\u65e0\u5bfc\u6570\u8fdb\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDifferentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning\uff08DERL\uff09\u53cc\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5916\u5c42Meta-Optimizer\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u539f\u5b50\u5956\u52b1\u57fa\u5143\u6f14\u5316\u5143\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u5728\u4e8e\u5143\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u5fae\u2014\u2014\u4ee5\u5185\u5c42\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0Meta-Optimizer\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u5bf9\u5143\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u2018\u5143\u68af\u5ea6\u2019\u3002", "result": "\u5728ALFWorld\uff08\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u3001ScienceWorld\uff08\u79d1\u5b66\u4eff\u771f\uff09\u548cGSM8k/MATH\uff08\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cDERL\u5728ALFWorld\u548cScienceWorld\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u6f14\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "DERL\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u5f0f\u5143\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6253\u901a\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8def\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Our dataset contains over 400 human annotated samples from diverse video sources, providing source/target images, handle/target points, editable region masks, and descriptive captions for both the image and the editing action.\n  We also propose four novel, task specific metrics: Semantical Distance (SeD), Outer Mask Preserving Score (OMPS), Inner Patch Preserving Score (IPPS), and Directional Similarity (DiS). These metrics are designed to quantify pixel level matching fidelity, check preservation of non edited (out of mask) regions, and measure semantic alignment with the desired task. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large scale systematic analysis of the field, evaluating 17 SOTA models. Our results reveal clear trade offs among current approaches and establish a robust, reproducible baseline to guide future research.

However, fine-grained functional grasping, which is essential for downstream manipulation tasks, remains underexplored and faces several challenges: the complexity of specifying goals and reward functions for functional grasps across diverse objects, the difficulty of multi-task RL exploration, and the challenge of sim-to-real transfer. In this work, we propose DemoFunGrasp for universal dexterous functional grasping. We factorize functional grasping conditions into two complementary components - grasping style and affordance - and integrate them into an RL framework that can learn to grasp any object with any functional grasping condition. To address the multi-task optimization challenge, we leverage a single grasping demonstration and reformulate the RL problem as one-step demonstration editing, substantially enhancing sample efficiency and performance. Experimental results in both simulation and the real world show that DemoFunGrasp generalizes to unseen combinations of objects, affordances, and grasping styles, outperforming baselines in both success rate and functional grasping accuracy.

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $\u03c1$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode.

Measuring Envy-Like Preferences in Multi-Agent Settings", "comment": "Under Review", "summary": "Envy is a common human behavior that shapes competitiveness and can alter outcomes in team settings. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains.

Various uncertainty measures have been proposed for this purpose, typically claiming superiority over other measures. In this paper, we argue that there is no single best measure. Instead, uncertainty quantification should be tailored to the specific application. To this end, we use a flexible family of uncertainty measures that distinguishes between total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty of second-order distributions. These measures can be instantiated with specific loss functions, so-called proper scoring rules, to control their characteristics, and we show that different characteristics are useful for different tasks. In particular, we show that, for the task of selective prediction, the scoring rule should ideally match the task loss. On the other hand, for out-of-distribution detection, our results confirm that mutual information, a widely used measure of epistemic uncertainty, performs best. Furthermore, in an active learning setting, epistemic uncertainty based on zero-one loss is shown to consistently outperform other uncertainty measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8ffd\u6c42\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u635f\u5931\u6216\u9009\u7528\u7279\u5b9aproper scoring rule\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u58f0\u79f0\u67d0\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\u65e0\u666e\u9002\u6700\u4f18\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65cf\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u603b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5076\u7136\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7proper scoring rules\uff08\u5982\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u8868\u5f81\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e0-1\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u5e94\u8ffd\u6c42\u901a\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u5e94\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing TAS methods typically train an over-parameterized network (i.e., a supernet) that encompasses all candidate architectures (i.e., subnets). However, all subnets share the same set of weights, which leads to interference that degrades the smaller subnets severely. We have found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good foundation for training larger ones. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive training framework, dubbed GrowTAS, that begins with training small subnets and incorporate larger ones gradually. This enables reducing the interference and stabilizing a training process. We also introduce GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes a subset of weights only to further enhance the performance of large subnets.

The COaxially Aligned STeerable (COAST) guidewire robot has the ability to generate a wide variety of motions including bending motion with different bending lengths, follow-the-leader motion, and feedforward motion. In our past studies, we have explored different designs of the COAST guidewire robot and developed modeling, control, and sensing strategies for the COAST guidewire robot. In this study, the performance of a modified COAST guidewire robot is evaluated by conducting navigation experiments in an anatomical phantom model with pulsatile flow.

To address this critical gap, we introduce Intention-Drive, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the ability to translate high-level human intent into safe and precise driving actions. Intention-Drive features two core contributions: (1) a new dataset of complex scenarios paired with corresponding natural language intentions, and (2) a novel evaluation protocol centered on the Intent Success Rate (ISR), which assesses the semantic fulfillment of the human's goal beyond simple geometric accuracy.

This work presents a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) docking of JAXA's Int-Ball2 robot inside a high-fidelity Isaac Sim model of the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we train and evaluate controllers under domain-randomized dynamics and bounded observation noise, while explicitly modeling propeller drag-torque effects and polarity structure. This enables a controlled study of how Int-Ball2's propulsion physics influence RL-based docking performance in constrained microgravity interiors. The learned policy achieves stable and reliable docking across varied conditions and lays the groundwork for future extensions pertaining to Int-Ball2 in collision-aware navigation, safe RL, propulsion-accurate sim-to-real transfer, and vision-based end-to-end docking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PPO\uff09\u7684\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bf9\u63a5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eJAXA\u7684Int-Ball2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\u65e5\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8231\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5bf9\u63a5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u542b\u62d6\u66f3\u529b\u77e9\u4e0e\u6781\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u53ca\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u78b0\u649e\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u5b89\u5168RL\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5bf9\u63a5\u7b49\u540e\u7eed\u5de5\u4f5c\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fd\u9645\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\u8231\u5185\u81ea\u4e3b\u98de\u884c\u5668\u9700\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6267\u884c\u5668\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u63a5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Isaac Sim\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u65e5\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6a21\u5757\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec36-DoF\u5bf9\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u6709\u754c\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668\u62d6\u66f3\u529b\u77e9\u4e0e\u6781\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6270\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5bf9\u63a5\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u5bf9RL\u5bf9\u63a5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5RL\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Int-Ball2\u5728\u5fae\u91cd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u63a5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u78b0\u649e\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5bf9\u63a5\u7b49\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, na\u00efve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSkipCat\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4f4e\u79e9\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u5185\u5171\u4eab\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u5757\u8df3\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u79e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08+7%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4e\u79e9\u538b\u7f29\u9700\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u79e9\u624d\u80fd\u8282\u7701\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSkipCat\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c42\u5185\u5171\u4eab\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4f7f\u591a\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u5171\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u6295\u5f71\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff1b2\uff09\u5757\u8df3\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u5757\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u4f4e\u79e9\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53477%\u3002", "conclusion": "SkipCat\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6709\u6548\u79e9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

In clinical applications, a transparent, step-by-step reasoning process provides physicians with strong evidence to support decision-making.

To address this gap, we propose MedCEG, a framework that augments medical language models with clinically valid reasoning pathways by explicitly supervising the reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). We curate a dataset of challenging clinical cases and algorithmically construct a CEG for each sample to represent a high-quality verifiable reasoning pathway.

We conduct an early-stage scaling-law analysis of continued pretraining on U.S. SEC filings, training 1B and 3B-parameter Llama-3.2 models on a 400M-token financial corpus with validation checkpoints at 50M, 100M, 200M, and 400M tokens. Results show consistent improvements in SEC-domain validation loss for both models, with the largest gains occurring within the first 200M tokens and diminishing returns thereafter. Power-law fits reveal shallow exponents, indicating that financial language is highly regular and efficiently learnable under continued pretraining. General-domain validation loss remains effectively unchanged across all token budgets, suggesting minimal drift and no signs of catastrophic forgetting. A data-efficiency frontier further shows that both models move toward improved specialization with negligible mixed-domain degradation. Together, these findings provide early empirical guidance for scaling financial foundation models, suggesting that meaningful domain adaptation can be achieved with comparatively modest token budgets and that larger model scales (7B-70B) remain tractable under projected data requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728SEC\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5bf9Llama-3.2\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08DAPT\uff09\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u97002\u4ebftoken\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u5230\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\uff09\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u57284\u4ebftoken\u7684\u7f8e\u56fdSEC\u91d1\u878d\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf91B\u548c3B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Llama-3.2\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u5c55\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u572850M\u3001100M\u3001200M\u3001400M token\u5904\u4fdd\u5b58\u9a8c\u8bc1\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5e42\u5f8b\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u589e\u76ca\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u524d2\u4ebftoken\uff0c\u4e4b\u540e\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\uff1b\u5e42\u5f8b\u6307\u6570\u8f83\u6d45\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u91d1\u878d\u8bed\u8a00\u9ad8\u5ea6\u89c4\u5f8b\u3001\u6613\u5b66\uff1b\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u635f\u5931\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u65e0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u524d\u6cbf\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u540c\u65f6\u6df7\u5408\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548DAPT\u53ef\u5728\u8f83\u5c0ftoken\u9884\u7b97\uff08\u59822\u4ebf\uff09\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff087B\u201370B\uff09\u5728\u53ef\u9884\u671f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5177\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91d1\u878d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e9\u671f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, existing UDA methods still struggle to bridge the domain gap due to cross-domain contextual ambiguity, inconsistent feature representations, and class-wise pseudo-label noise. To address these challenges, we propose Omni-level Masking for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OMUDA), a unified framework that introduces hierarchical masking strategies across distinct representation levels. Specifically, OMUDA comprises: 1) a Context-Aware Masking (CAM) strategy that adaptively distinguishes foreground from background to balance global context and local details; 2) a Feature Distillation Masking (FDM) strategy that enhances robust and consistent feature learning through knowledge transfer from pre-trained models; and 3) a Class Decoupling Masking (CDM) strategy that mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels by explicitly modeling class-wise uncertainty. This hierarchical masking paradigm effectively reduces the domain shift at the contextual, representational, and categorical levels, providing a unified solution beyond existing approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of OMUDA. Notably, on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes tasks, OMUDA can be seamlessly integrated into existing UDA methods and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 7%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOMUDA\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u89e3\u8026\u63a9\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08UDA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u57df\u95f4\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8de8\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u53ca\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOMUDA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\uff08CAM\uff09\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533a\u5206\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\uff1b2\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u63a9\u7801\uff08FDM\uff09\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u7c7b\u522b\u89e3\u8026\u63a9\u7801\uff08CDM\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728SYNTHIA\u2192Cityscapes\u548cGTA5\u2192Cityscapes\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cOMUDA\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u73b0\u6709UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53477%\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "OMUDA\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u534f\u540c\u51cf\u5c0f\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3aUDA\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Conventional ranging sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ultrasonic devices provide broad situational awareness but often fail to detect small objects near the robot base. To address this limitation, this paper presents a three-tier near-field perception framework. The first approach employs light-discontinuity detection, which projects a laser stripe across the near-field zone and identifies interruptions in the stripe to perform fast, binary cutoff sensing for obstacle presence. The second approach utilizes light-displacement measurement to estimate object height by analyzing the geometric displacement of a projected stripe in the camera image, which provides quantitative obstacle height information with minimal computational overhead. The third approach employs a computer vision-based object detection model on embedded AI hardware to classify objects, enabling semantic perception and context-aware safety decisions. All methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 system, achieving real-time performance at 25 or 50 frames per second. Experimental evaluation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy balances precision, computation, and cost, thereby providing a scalable perception solution for enabling safe operations of AMRs in manufacturing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u5c42\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6fc0\u5149\u6761\u7eb9\u4e2d\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4f4d\u79fb\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fAI\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08AMR\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fd1\u573a\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8ddd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982LiDAR\u548c\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e95\u76d8\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u969c\u788d\u7269\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6AMR\u5728\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u5c42\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u5149\u6761\u7eb9\u4e2d\u65ad\u7684\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u5feb\u901f\u969c\u788d\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u7eb9\u51e0\u4f55\u4f4d\u79fb\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7269\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5b9a\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fAI\u786c\u4ef6\uff08Raspberry Pi 5\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u4e09\u8005\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0825/50 FPS\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728Raspberry Pi 5\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u6808\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u573a\u969c\u788d\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e09\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u573a\u666f\u4e0bAMR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002"}}

Additionally, our analysis provides insights into the impact of each linguistic module and evaluates how effectively our model handles space during text generation, which is crucial for the naturalness of texts in Khmer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PrahokBART\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8bed\u6599\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u878d\u5165\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u7279\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u5206\u8bcd\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u548c\u6807\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86mBART50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u89c6\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u683c\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u5206\u8bcd\u9700\u6c42\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u6599\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578bPrahokBART\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u4e0e\u82f1\u8bed\u8bed\u6599\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u7279\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u548c\u6807\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u8d21\u732e\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7a7a\u683c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "PrahokBART\u5728\u4e09\u9879\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebfmBART50\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u4e60\u60ef\u7684\u7a7a\u683c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bed\u6599\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u9002\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 14 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations. Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection, revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.

However, current adaptations of GRPO for the flow matching-based image generation neglect a foundational conflict between its core principles and the distinct dynamics of the visual synthesis process. This mismatch leads to two key limitations: (i) Uniformly applying a sparse terminal reward across all timesteps impairs temporal credit assignment, ignoring the differing criticality of generation phases from early structure formation to late-stage tuning. (ii) Exclusive reliance on relative, intra-group rewards causes the optimization signal to fade as training converges, leading to the optimization stagnation when reward diversity is entirely depleted. To address these limitations, we propose Value-Anchored Group Policy Optimization (VGPO), a framework that redefines value estimation across both temporal and group dimensions. Specifically, VGPO transforms the sparse terminal reward into dense, process-aware value estimates, enabling precise credit assignment by modeling the expected cumulative reward at each generative stage. Furthermore, VGPO replaces standard group normalization with a novel process enhanced by absolute values to maintain a stable optimization signal even as reward diversity declines. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that VGPO achieves state-of-the-art image quality while simultaneously improving task-specific accuracy, effectively mitigating reward hacking.

We introduce DexWM, a Dexterous Manipulation World Model that predicts the next latent state of the environment conditioned on past states and dexterous actions. To overcome the scarcity of dexterous manipulation datasets, DexWM is trained on over 900 hours of human and non-dexterous robot videos. To enable fine-grained dexterity, we find that predicting visual features alone is insufficient; therefore, we introduce an auxiliary hand consistency loss that enforces accurate hand configurations. DexWM outperforms prior world models conditioned on text, navigation, and full-body actions, achieving more accurate predictions of future states. DexWM also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen manipulation skills when deployed on a Franka Panda arm equipped with an Allegro gripper, outperforming Diffusion Policy by over 50% on average in grasping, placing, and reaching tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DexWM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7075\u5de7\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u5927\u91cf\u975e\u7075\u5de7\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u624b\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u7ec6\u5fae\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u63a5\u89e6\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u800c\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDexWM\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5386\u53f2\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u7075\u5de7\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u5229\u7528900\u591a\u5c0f\u65f6\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u975e\u7075\u5de7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "result": "DexWM\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u5168\u8eab\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5df2\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728Franka Panda\u673a\u68b0\u81c2+Allegro\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u672a\u89c1\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u65f6\uff0c\u6293\u53d6\u3001\u653e\u7f6e\u3001\u5230\u8fbe\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4Diffusion Policy\u63d0\u5347\u8d8550%\u3002", "conclusion": "DexWM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u624b\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The stances of conversation replies often provide important cues to determine a rumor's veracity. However, existing models struggle to jointly capture semantic content, stance information, and conversation strructure, especially under the sequence length constraints of transformer-based encoders. In this work, we propose a stance-aware structural modeling that encodes each post in a discourse with its stance signal and aggregates reply embedddings by stance category enabling a scalable and semantically enriched representation of the entire thread. To enhance structural awareness, we introduce stance distribution and hierarchical depth as covariates, capturing stance imbalance and the influence of reply depth. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior methods in the ability to predict truthfulness of a rumor.

Methods without cross-modal fusion layers (non-fusion) offer faster inference by treating recognition as a retrieval problem, \\ie, matching regions to text queries in a shared embedding space. In this work, we fully explore this retrieval philosophy and demonstrate its unique advantages in efficiency and versatility through a model family named WeDetect: (1) State-of-the-art performance. WeDetect is a real-time detector with a dual-tower architecture. We show that, with well-curated data and full training, the non-fusion WeDetect surpasses other fusion models and establishes a strong open-vocabulary foundation. (2) Fast backtrack of historical data. WeDetect-Uni is a universal proposal generator based on WeDetect. We freeze the entire detector and only finetune an objectness prompt to retrieve generic object proposals across categories. Importantly, the proposal embeddings are class-specific and enable a new application, object retrieval, supporting retrieval objects in historical data. (3) Integration with LMMs for referring expression comprehension (REC). We further propose WeDetect-Ref, an LMM-based object classifier to handle complex referring expressions, which retrieves target objects from the proposal list extracted by WeDetect-Uni.

However, existing methods struggle with this compositional task. To this end, we propose RoboTracer, a 3D-aware VLM that first achieves both 3D spatial referring and measuring via a universal spatial encoder and a regression-supervised decoder to enhance scale awareness during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboTracer advances multi-step metric-grounded reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with metric-sensitive process rewards, supervising key intermediate perceptual cues to accurately generate spatial traces. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce TraceSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, spanning outdoor/indoor/tabletop scenes and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 9 steps). We further present TraceSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap to evaluate spatial tracing. Experimental results show that RoboTracer surpasses baselines in spatial understanding, measuring, and referring, with an average success rate of 79.1%, and also achieves SOTA performance on TraceSpatial-Bench by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 36% accuracy. Notably, RoboTracer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRoboTracer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd3D\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u56de\u5f52\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b03D\u7a7a\u95f4\u6307\u4ee3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6b65\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6TraceSpatial\u53ca\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6TraceSpatial-Bench\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ffd\u8e2a\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5177\u8eab\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u591a\u6b65\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u6307\u4ee3\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5ea6\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u6311\u6218\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u80dc\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRoboTracer\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u901a\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u76d1\u7763\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4e2d\u589e\u5f3a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u654f\u611f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\uff08RFT\uff09\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5173\u952e\u4e2d\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u7d22\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u542b3000\u4e07QA\u5bf9\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6TraceSpatial\u53ca\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6TraceSpatial-Bench\u3002", "result": "RoboTracer\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u738779.1%\uff0c\u5728TraceSpatial-Bench\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8aGemini-2.5-Pro\u8fbe36%\uff1b\u53ef\u9002\u914dUR5\u3001G1\u7b49\u591a\u7c7b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u957f\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "RoboTracer\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u30013D\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ffd\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08token\u7ea7\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\uff09\u3001\u529f\u80fd\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3 agent memory\uff0c\u5e76\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u524d\u6cbf\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d agent memory \u7814\u7a76\u65e5\u76ca\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u672f\u8bed\u6df7\u4e71\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u7cca\uff08\u5982\u4f20\u7edf\u957f\u77ed\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5df2\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u68b3\u7406\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u6f84\u6e05\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u754c\u5b9a agent memory \u7684\u8303\u7574\uff08\u533a\u522b\u4e8eLLM memory\u3001RAG\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08forms\uff09\u3001\u529f\u80fd\uff08functions\uff09\u3001\u52a8\u6001\uff08dynamics\uff09\u4e09\u91cd\u89c6\u89d2\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6c47\u603b\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u524d\u6cbf\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u4e09\u7c7b\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684 agent memory \u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1b\u6574\u7406\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001/\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53ca\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u7b49\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "agent memory \u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4f5c\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u7b49\u516c\u6c11\uff08first-class primitive\uff09\uff0c\u672c\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u84dd\u56fe\u3002"}}

While recent tabular transformers and in-context learners such as SAINT, TP-BERTa, TabPFN, TabICL, and MITRA incorporate limited inter-row reasoning, most approaches still lack an explicit mechanism to model relationships among instances, even though similar samples often share related outcomes. We investigate whether introducing \\emph{simple graph priors} can enhance \\emph{pretrained tabular transformers}. Concretely, we introduce {BOLERO}, a lightweight, static bipartite graph head that augments {RoBERTa-Tab} (a RoBERTa-style tabular backbone pretrained with masked-token prediction.) Each instance connects to feature/value anchors; a small GNN refines row representations, while the backbone remains frozen.

Broadly, inference-time training-free approaches for aligning diffusion models can be categorized into two main strategies: sampling-based methods, which explore multiple candidate outputs and select those with higher reward signals, and gradient-guided methods, which use differentiable reward approximations to directly steer the generation process. In this work, we propose a universal algorithm, UniCoDe, which brings together the strengths of sampling and gradient-based guidance into a unified framework. UniCoDe integrates local gradient signals during sampling, thereby addressing the sampling inefficiency inherent in complex reward-based sampling approaches. By cohesively combining these two paradigms, UniCoDe enables more efficient sampling while offering better trade-offs between reward alignment and divergence from the diffusion unconditional prior.

Yet prior works have largely relied on standard temporal logic (TL), which models only robot trajectories and overlooks object-level interactions. Existing datasets built from randomly generated TL formulas paired with natural-language descriptions therefore cover temporal operators but fail to represent the layered spatial relations that manipulation tasks depend on. To address this gap, we introduce a dataset generation framework that synthesizes SpaTiaL specifications and converts them into natural-language descriptions through a deterministic, semantics-preserving back-translation procedure. This pipeline produces the NL2SpaTiaL dataset, aligning natural language with multi-level spatial relations and temporal objectives to reflect the compositional structure of manipulation tasks. Building on this foundation, we propose a translation-verification framework equipped with a language-based semantic checker that ensures the generated SpaTiaL formulas faithfully encode the semantics specified by the input description. Experiments across a suite of manipulation tasks show that SpaTiaL-based representations yield more interpretable, verifiable, and compositional grounding for instruction following.

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReFusion\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eslot\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u2018\u89c4\u5212-\u586b\u5145\u2019\u8fed\u4ee3\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709MDM\u5e76\u903c\u8fd1\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6162\uff0c\u800c\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReFusion\uff1a\u5c06\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u4ecetoken\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347\u81f3slot\u7ea7\uff08\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u7684slot\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5f0f\u5e76\u884c\u586b\u5145\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7edf\u4e00\u56e0\u679c\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524dMDM\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534734%\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u52a0\u901f18\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u63012.33\u500d\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "slot\u7ea7\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86MDM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Yet, in real-field conditions, cluttered backgrounds, domain shifts, and limited lesion-level datasets hinder robust modeling. To address these challenges, we release Daylily-Leaf, a paired lesion-level dataset comprising 1,746 RGB images and 7,839 lesions captured under both ideal and in-field conditions, and propose TCLeaf-Net, a transformer-convolution hybrid detector optimized for real-field use. TCLeaf-Net is designed to tackle three major challenges. To mitigate interference from complex backgrounds, the transformer-convolution module (TCM) couples global context with locality-preserving convolution to suppress non-leaf regions. To reduce information loss during downsampling, the raw-scale feature recalling and sampling (RSFRS) block combines bilinear resampling and convolution to preserve fine spatial detail. To handle variations in lesion scale and feature shifts, the deformable alignment block with FPN (DFPN) employs offset-based alignment and multi-receptive-field perception to strengthen multi-scale fusion. Experimental results show that on the in-field split of the Daylily-Leaf dataset, TCLeaf-Net improves mAP@50 by 5.4 percentage points over the baseline model, reaching 78.2\\%, while reducing computation by 7.5 GFLOPs and GPU memory usage by 8.7\\%.

Despite recent progress, many existing approaches still rely on hand-crafted reasoning pipelines or employ token-consuming video preprocessing to guide MLLMs in autonomous reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VideoARM, an Agentic Reasoning-over-hierarchical-Memory paradigm for long-form video understanding. Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making. Experiments on prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that VideoARM outperforms the state-of-the-art method, DVD, while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVideoARM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf-\u601d\u8003-\u884c\u52a8-\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5faa\u73af\u53ca\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4etoken\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u9762\u4e34\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u957f\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u6216\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVideoARM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u89c2\u5bdf-\u601d\u8003-\u884c\u52a8-\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u89e3\u6790\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6355\u83b7\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u591a\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7d22\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5DVD\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4etoken\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoARM\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aMLLMs\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Such variability complicates the RL infrastructure, slows training, and makes training curriculum (e.g., response length extension) and hyperparameter selection challenging. In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1). Our 14B model, after RL, outperforms its SFT teacher, DeepSeek-R1-0528, on LiveCodeBench v5/v6/Pro and achieves silver-medal performance in the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).

Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u90fd\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u662f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6734\u7d20\u6570\u5b57\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u4e49\u65e5\u5386\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u7ecf\u5178\u5747\u5300\u5206\u7bb1\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\u6807\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f53\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u666e\u904d\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u504f\u659c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u683c\u5f0f\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u4f9d\u636e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u91c7\u7528\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often rely on heavy video-based finetuning or large-scale video datasets, which impose substantial computational cost and are difficult to scale. Furthermore, they still struggle to maintain fine-grained appearance consistency across frames. To address these limitations, we introduce V-Warper, a training-free coarse-to-fine personalization framework for transformer-based video diffusion models. The framework enhances fine-grained identity fidelity without requiring any additional video training. (1) A lightweight coarse appearance adaptation stage leverages only a small set of reference images, which are already required for the task. This step encodes global subject identity through image-only LoRA and subject-embedding adaptation.

Code is available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/CrossModalDistillation", "summary": "Local field potentials (LFPs) can be routinely recorded alongside spiking activity in intracortical neural experiments, measure a larger complementary spatiotemporal scale of brain activity for scientific inquiry, and can offer practical advantages over spikes, including greater long-term stability, robustness to electrode degradation, and lower power requirements. Despite these advantages, recent neural modeling frameworks have largely focused on spiking activity since LFP signals pose inherent modeling challenges due to their aggregate, population-level nature, often leading to lower predictive power for downstream task variables such as motor behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that transfers high-fidelity representational knowledge from pretrained multi-session spike transformer models to LFP transformer models. Specifically, we first train a teacher spike model across multiple recording sessions using a masked autoencoding objective with a session-specific neural tokenization strategy. We then align the latent representations of the student LFP model to those of the teacher spike model. Our results show that the Distilled LFP models consistently outperform single- and multi-session LFP baselines in both fully unsupervised and supervised settings, and can generalize to other sessions without additional distillation while maintaining superior performance. These findings demonstrate that cross-modal knowledge distillation is a powerful and scalable approach for leveraging high-performing spike models to develop more accurate LFP models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5c16\u5cf0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08spike\uff09Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u573a\u7535\u4f4d\uff08LFP\uff09Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LFP\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "LFP\u867d\u5177\u6709\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6297\u7535\u6781\u9000\u5316\u548c\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u5176\u7fa4\u4f53\u6027\u3001\u805a\u5408\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u5ea6\u5927\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5f31\u4e8e\u5c16\u5cf0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5c16\u5cf0\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6LFP\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u4ee5\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5c16\u5cf0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6559\u5e08\u5c16\u5cf0Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u81f3\u5b66\u751fLFP Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684LFP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e0e\u591a\u4f1a\u8bddLFP\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u989d\u5916\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u65b0\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u8d8a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5c16\u5cf0\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347LFP\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aLFP\u5728\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While existing large-scale HMR datasets rely heavily on line-of-sight RGB input, vision-based sensing is limited by occlusion, lighting variation, and privacy concerns. To overcome these limitations, recent efforts have explored radio-frequency (RF) mmWave radar for privacy-preserving indoor human sensing. However, current radar datasets are constrained by sparse skeleton labels, limited scale, and simple in-place actions. To advance the HMR research community, we introduce M4Human, the current largest-scale (661K-frame) ($9\\times$ prior largest) multimodal benchmark, featuring high-resolution mmWave radar, RGB, and depth data. M4Human provides both raw radar tensors (RT) and processed radar point clouds (RPC) to enable research across different levels of RF signal granularity. M4Human includes high-quality motion capture (MoCap) annotations with 3D meshes and global trajectories, and spans 20 subjects and 50 diverse actions, including in-place, sit-in-place, and free-space sports or rehabilitation movements. We establish benchmarks on both RT and RPC modalities, as well as multimodal fusion with RGB-D modalities. Extensive results highlight the significance of M4Human for radar-based human modeling while revealing persistent challenges under fast, unconstrained motion.

While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u6d88\u9664\u5de5\u5177\uff08Heretic\u3001DECCP\u3001ErisForge\u3001FailSpy\uff09\u572816\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u6d88\u878d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982ErisForge\u3001DECCP\uff09\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u8d77\u8f83\u5927\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff1b\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff08GSM8K\uff09\u5bf9\u6d88\u878d\u5e72\u9884\u6700\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u5e45\u5ea6\u8fbe-18.81\u81f3+1.51\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u867d\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u6709\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u5408\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u6d88\u9664\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u6d88\u878d\u5de5\u5177\uff08Heretic\u3001DECCP\u3001ErisForge\u3001FailSpy\uff09\u572816\u4e2a7B\u201314B\u53c2\u6570\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528GSM8K\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u7559\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6b21\u6d88\u878d\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u4f18\uff08ErisForge\u3001DECCP\u5728GSM8K\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d\u4ec5-0.28\u548c-0.13\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff09\uff1b\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\uff080.043\u20131.646\uff09\uff1b\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6700\u654f\u611f\uff0cGSM8K\u53d8\u5316\u8303\u56f4\u8fbe+1.51\u81f3-18.81 pp\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e0b\u964d26.5%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u6d88\u878d\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e94\u4f9d\u636e\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u5355\u6b21\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Code is available at https://github.com/ShanechiLab/mrine", "summary": "Real-time decoding of target variables from multiple simultaneously recorded neural time-series modalities, such as discrete spiking activity and continuous field potentials, is important across various neuroscience applications. However, a major challenge for doing so is that different neural modalities can have different timescales (i.e., sampling rates) and different probabilistic distributions, or can even be missing at some time-steps. Existing nonlinear models of multimodal neural activity do not address different timescales or missing samples across modalities. Further, some of these models do not allow for real-time decoding. Here, we develop a learning framework that can enable real-time recursive decoding while nonlinearly aggregating information across multiple modalities with different timescales and distributions and with missing samples. This framework consists of 1) a multiscale encoder that nonlinearly aggregates information after learning within-modality dynamics to handle different timescales and missing samples in real time, 2) a multiscale dynamical backbone that extracts multimodal temporal dynamics and enables real-time recursive decoding, and 3) modality-specific decoders to account for different probabilistic distributions across modalities. In both simulations and three distinct multiscale brain datasets, we show that our model can aggregate information across modalities with different timescales and distributions and missing samples to improve real-time target decoding. Further, our method outperforms various linear and nonlinear multimodal benchmarks in doing so.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u8109\u51b2\u4e0e\u573a\u7535\u4f4d\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9012\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8111\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08\u91c7\u6837\u7387\uff09\u3001\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u6837\u672c\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u9012\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\uff1b3\uff09\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8111\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u6837\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u65f6\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u878d\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic 3D Vision-Language-Planning Model (D3D-VLP). Our model introduces two key innovations: 1) A Dynamic 3D Chain-of-Thought (3D CoT) that unifies planning, grounding, navigation, and question answering within a single 3D-VLM and CoT pipeline; 2) A Synergistic Learning from Fragmented Supervision (SLFS) strategy, which uses a masked autoregressive loss to learn from massive and partially-annotated hybrid data. This allows different CoT components to mutually reinforce and implicitly supervise each other.

Speaker recognition in the speech domain usually examines phonetic or acoustic properties of a voice, and these methods can be accurate and robust under certain conditions. However, if a speaker disguises their voice or employs text-to-speech software, vocal properties may no longer be reliable, leaving only their linguistic content available for analysis. Authorship attribution methods traditionally use syntactic, semantic, and related linguistic information to identify writers of written text (authorship attribution). In this paper, we apply a content-based authorship approach to speech that has been transcribed into text, using what a speaker says to attribute speech to individuals (speaker attribution). We introduce a stylometric method, StyloSpeaker, which incorporates character, word, token, sentence, and style features from the stylometric literature on authorship, to assess whether two transcripts were produced by the same speaker. We evaluate this method on two types of transcript formatting: one approximating prescriptive written text with capitalization and punctuation and another normalized style that removes these conventions. The transcripts' conversation topics are also controlled to varying degrees. We find generally higher attribution performance on normalized transcripts, except under the strongest topic control condition, in which overall performance is highest. Finally, we compare this more explainable stylometric model to black-box neural approaches on the same data and investigate which stylistic features most effectively distinguish speakers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5StyloSpeaker\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u548c\u8bdd\u9898\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u9ed1\u7bb1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u533a\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4f2a\u88c5\u58f0\u97f3\u6216\u4f7f\u7528TTS\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u58f0\u5b66/\u8bed\u97f3\u7279\u5f81\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4ec5\u5269\u8bed\u8a00\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u7528\uff1b\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u578b\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStyloSpeaker\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5b57\u7b26\u3001\u8bcd\u3001\u8bcd\u5143\u3001\u53e5\u5b50\u53ca\u98ce\u683c\u7b49\u6587\u4f53\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u8f6c\u5f55\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u89c4\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5f0f\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bdd\u9898\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u5e76\u4e0e\u9ed1\u7bb1\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u533a\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8f6c\u5f55\u6587\u672c\u901a\u5e38\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u5f52\u5c5e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u6700\u5f3a\u8bdd\u9898\u63a7\u5236\u9664\u5916\uff09\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u6700\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u6700\u5f3a\u8bdd\u9898\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\uff1bStyloSpeaker\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u9891\u3001n-gram\u3001\u53e5\u957f\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u88ab\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6700\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5f52\u5c5e\u662f\u58f0\u7eb9\u5931\u6548\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff1bStyloSpeaker\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53f8\u6cd5\u8bed\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u900f\u660e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

TM, similar to previous paradigms, gradually transforms noise samples to data samples, however it uses a second ``internal'' generative model to implement the transition steps, making the transitions more expressive compared to diffusion and flow models. To make this paradigm tractable, TM employs a large backbone network and a smaller \"head\" module to efficiently execute the generative transition step. In this work, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation into the design, training and sampling of the head in TM frameworks, focusing on its time-continuous bidirectional variant. Through comprehensive ablations and experimentation involving training 56 different 1.7B text-to-image models (resulting in 549 unique evaluations) we evaluate the affect of the head module architecture and modeling during training as-well as a useful family of stochastic TM samplers. We analyze the impact on generation quality, training, and inference efficiency. We find that TM with an MLP head, trained with a particular time weighting and sampled with high frequency sampler provides best ranking across all metrics reaching state-of-the-art among all tested baselines, while Transformer head with sequence scaling and low frequency sampling is a runner up excelling at image aesthetics. Lastly, we believe the experiments presented highlight the design aspects that are likely to provide most quality and efficiency gains, while at the same time indicate what design choices are not likely to provide further gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Transition Matching (TM)\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u201chead\u201d\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0856\u4e2a1.7B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u53d1\u73b0MLP head\u914d\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800cTransformer head\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f8e\u5b66\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "Transition Matching\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8transition\u6b65\u9aa4\u4f9d\u8d56head\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u6784\u5efa56\u4e2a1.7B\u53c2\u6570\u7684text-to-image TM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540chead\u67b6\u6784\uff08MLP/Transformer\uff09\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u5f0f\uff09\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u9891\u7387/\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5171549\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790time-continuous bidirectional TM\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "MLP head + \u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743 + \u9ad8\u9891\u91c7\u6837\u5728FID\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u7efc\u5408\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff1bTransformer head + \u5e8f\u5217\u7f29\u653e + \u4f4e\u9891\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5982\u67d0\u4e9b\u67b6\u6784\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "head\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9TM\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5de8\u5927\uff0cMLP\u4e0eTransformer\u5404\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u9891\u7387\uff09\u4e0e\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u76ca\u4f4e\u7684\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eedTM\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

Existing generative models often rely on single-view inputs representing closed states, resulting in ambiguous or unrealistic kinematic structures due to the entanglement between geometric shape and joint dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtGen, a conditional diffusion-based framework capable of generating articulated 3D objects with accurate geometry and coherent kinematics from single-view images or text descriptions at arbitrary part-level states. Specifically, ArtGen employs cross-state Monte Carlo sampling to explicitly enforce global kinematic consistency, reducing structural-motion entanglement. Additionally, we integrate a Chain-of-Thought reasoning module to infer robust structural priors, such as part semantics, joint types, and connectivity, guiding a sparse-expert Diffusion Transformer to specialize in diverse kinematic interactions. Furthermore, a compositional 3D-VAE latent prior enhanced with local-global attention effectively captures fine-grained geometry and global part-level relationships.

Sensor data from these systems are typically available only as processed object lists rather than raw sensor data from traditional sensors. Instead of processing other raw data separately and then fusing them at the object level, we propose an end-to-end cross-level fusion concept with Transformer, which integrates highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection. Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset. It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8de8\u5c42\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5217\u8868\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u7528\u4e8e3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6c7d\u8f66\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548cV2X\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u63d0\u4f9b\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5217\u8868\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u7c7b\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u8c61\u5217\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u5217\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53bb\u566a\u67e5\u8be2\u8f93\u5165Transformer\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u67e5\u8be2\u5171\u540c\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5148\u9a8c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u9ad8\u65af\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u5217\u8868\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u72b6\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u53ca\u6f0f\u68c0/\u8bef\u68c0\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5bf9\u8c61\u5217\u8868\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5c42\u7ea7\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf+\u5bf9\u8c61\u5217\u8868\uff09\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f66\u8f7d\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries. To address these challenges, we conceptualize personalization as a model editing task and introduce Personalization Editing, a framework that applies localized edits guided by clustered preference representations. This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPersonalization Editing\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89c6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8868\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u51c6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684UPQA\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u3001\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u53ca\u591a\u8f6e/\u9690\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u517c\u987e\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u56de\u5fc6\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPersonalization Editing\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u805a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u8f91\uff1b\u5e76\u6784\u5efaUser Preference Question Answering\uff08UPQA\uff09\u77ed\u7b54\u6848\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6e90\u81ea\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u3002", "result": "Personalization Editing\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1bUPQA\u80fd\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u504f\u597d\u805a\u7c7b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u9762\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684UPQA\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u6027\u5316LLM\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u3002"}}

Training combines activation normalization, a separation regularizer, and anchor or subspace regularizers that attract rare labeled examples to predefined directions or axis-aligned subspaces. The anchored geometry enables two practical interventions: reversible behavioral steering that projects out a concept's latent component at inference, and permanent removal via targeted weight ablation of anchored dimensions. Experiments on structured autoencoders show selective attenuation of targeted concepts with negligible impact on orthogonal features, and complete elimination with reconstruction error approaching theoretical bounds. Sparse Concept Anchoring therefore provides a practical pathway to interpretable, steerable behavior in learned representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u6982\u5ff5\u951a\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u5c11\u76d1\u7763\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2a\u951a\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5<0.1%\u6837\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9006\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u63a7\u4e0e\u6c38\u4e45\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u51c6\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u5206\u79bb\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53ca\u951a\u70b9/\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5c06\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u5438\u5f15\u81f3\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\u6216\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u6b63\u4ea4\u7279\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\uff1b\u5b8c\u5168\u79fb\u9664\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u6982\u5ff5\u951a\u5b9a\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based framework that reconstructs these missing vertical channels using only the current LiDAR frame, with no camera images or temporal information required. Each LiDAR sweep is represented as an unstructured spatial graph: points are nodes and edges connect nearby points while preserving the original beam-index ordering. A multi-layer GAT learns adaptive attention weights over local geometric neighborhoods and directly regresses the missing elevation (z) values at dropout locations. Trained and evaluated on 1,065 raw KITTI sequences with simulated channel dropout, the method achieves an average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, with 87.98% of reconstructed points falling within a 10 cm error threshold. Inference takes 14.65 seconds per frame on a single GPU, and reconstruction quality remains stable for different neighborhood sizes k. These results show that a pure graph attention model operating solely on raw point-cloud geometry can effectively recover dropped vertical beams under realistic sensor degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GAT\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u5e27LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\uff08\u65e0\u9700\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u56e0\u786c\u4ef6\u8001\u5316\u3001\u7070\u5c18\u3001\u96e8\u96ea\u3001\u96fe\u6c14\u6216\u5f3a\u53cd\u5c04\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u6ce2\u675f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d3D\u611f\u77e5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5782\u76f4\u6ce2\u675f\u4e22\u5931\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u7834\u574fLiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd3D\u611f\u77e5\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u5e27\u7eaf\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5355\u5e27LiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6ce2\u675f\u7d22\u5f15\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\uff08\u70b9\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u90bb\u8fd1\u70b9\u95f4\u8fde\u8fb9\uff09\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GAT\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u90bb\u57df\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u5f52\u7f3a\u5931\u70b9\u7684z\u5750\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u57281065\u6bb5KITTI\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u6ce2\u675f\u4e22\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9ad8\u5ea6RMSE\u4e3a11.67 cm\uff0c87.98%\u91cd\u5efa\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\u226410 cm\uff1b\u5355GPU\u63a8\u7406\u8017\u65f614.65\u79d2/\u5e27\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u90bb\u57df\u5927\u5c0fk\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u70b9\u4e91\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7eaf\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u5782\u76f4\u6ce2\u675f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u5355\u5e27\u3001\u65e0\u76f8\u673a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684LiDAR\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Language-related changes can be automatically identified through the analysis of outputs from linguistic assessment tasks, such as picture description. Language models show promise as a basis for screening tools for AD, but their limited interpretability poses a challenge in distinguishing true linguistic markers of cognitive decline from surface-level textual patterns. To address this issue, we examine how surface form variation affects classification performance, with the goal of assessing the ability of language models to represent underlying semantic indicators. We introduce a novel approach where texts surface forms are transformed by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content. The transformations significantly modify the structure and lexical content, as indicated by low BLEU and chrF scores, yet retain the underlying semantics, as reflected in high semantic similarity scores, isolating the effect of semantic information, and finding models perform similarly to if they were using the original text, with only small deviations in macro-F1. We also investigate whether language from picture descriptions retains enough detail to reconstruct the original image using generative models. We found that image-based transformations add substantial noise reducing classification accuracy. Our methodology provides a novel way of looking at what features influence model predictions, and allows the removal of possible spurious correlations. We find that just using semantic information, language model based classifiers can still detect AD. This work shows that difficult to detect semantic impairment can be identified, addressing an overlooked feature of linguistic deterioration, and opening new pathways for early detection systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6539\u53d8\u6587\u672c\u8868\u5c42\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\uff09\uff0c\u6765\u68c0\u9a8c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u4e0e\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522bAD\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u635f\u4f24\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728AD\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u6f5c\u529b\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7279\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8870\u9000\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u6539\u5199\u53e5\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408BLEU/chrF\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u8868\u5c42\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7a76\u56fe\u7247\u63cf\u8ff0\u6587\u672c\u80fd\u5426\u91cd\u6784\u539f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u6587\u672c\u867d\u8868\u5c42\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff08\u4f4eBLEU/chrF\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4fdd\u7559\uff08\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff08macro-F1\uff09\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4ecd\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4bAD\uff1b\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u80fd\u6355\u83b7AD\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5265\u79bb\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u65e9\u671fAD\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present Graph of Molecule Substructures (GoMS), a novel architecture that explicitly models the interactions and spatial arrangements between molecular substructures. Unlike ESAN's bag-based representation, GoMS constructs a graph where nodes represent subgraphs and edges capture their structural relationships, preserving critical topological information about how substructures are connected and overlap within the molecule. Through extensive experiments on public molecular datasets, we demonstrate that GoMS outperforms ESAN and other baseline methods, with particularly improvements for large molecules containing more than 100 atoms. The performance gap widens as molecular size increases, demonstrating GoMS's effectiveness for modeling industrial-scale molecules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GoMS can distinguish molecules with identical subgraph compositions but different spatial arrangements. Our approach shows particular promise for materials science applications involving complex molecules where properties emerge from the interplay between multiple functional units.

This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level \"delta action\" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMotus\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u6574\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528UniDiffuser\u5f0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u5207\u6362\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u516d\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u63d0\u53d6\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7'\u589e\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c'\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u63a7\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMotus\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09Mixture-of-Transformer\uff08MoT\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b2\uff09UniDiffuser\u98ce\u683c\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u652f\u6301\u4e94\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u5f0f\u7075\u6d3b\u5207\u6362\uff1b3\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b4\uff09\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u516d\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u63d0\u53d6\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7'delta action'\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8f83X-VLA\u63d0\u5347+15%\u3001\u8f83Pi0.5\u63d0\u5347+45%\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347+11%~48%\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u6240\u6709\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0cMotus\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

This study extends temporal prediction analysis to Week 20 (50% of course duration), comparing Decision Tree and Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) models across six temporal snapshots. Our analysis reveals that different performance metrics matter at different intervention stages: high recall is critical for early intervention (Weeks 2-4), while balanced precision-recall is important for mid-course resource allocation (Weeks 8-16), and high precision becomes paramount in later stages (Week 20). We demonstrate that static demographic features dominate predictions (68% importance), enabling assessment-free early prediction. The LSTM model achieves 97% recall at Week 2, making it ideal for early intervention, while Decision Tree provides stable balanced performance (78% accuracy) during mid-course. By Week 20, both models converge to similar recall (68%), but LSTM achieves higher precision (90% vs 86%). Our findings also suggest that model selection should depend on intervention timing, and that early signals (Weeks 2-4) are sufficient for reliable initial prediction using primarily demographic and pre-enrollment information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff08\u81f3\u7b2c20\u5468\uff09\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u8f8d\u5b66\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u91cd\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u4e2d\u671f\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5219\u5f3a\u8c03\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u9759\u6001\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0868%\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ca\u65e9\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65bd\u6709\u6548\u5e72\u9884\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u673a\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5339\u914d\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5feb\u7167\uff08\u81f3\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b2c20\u5468\uff0c\u537350%\u8fdb\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4e0eLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u5173\u952e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "LSTM\u5728\u7b2c2\u5468\u8fbe97%\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\uff1b\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5728\u7b2c8\u201316\u5468\u4fdd\u630178%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4e2d\u671f\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u81f3\u7b2c20\u5468\uff0c\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5747\u4e3a68%\uff0c\u4f46LSTM\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0890% vs 86%\uff09\uff1b\u9759\u6001\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e68%\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u673a\u51b3\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b2c2\u20134\u5468\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6ce8\u518c\u524d\u4fe1\u606f\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u521d\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u3001\u65e9\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

High-quality bokeh rendering pipelines typically depend on noisy depth maps, which amplify estimation errors into visible artifacts, while modern monocular metric depth models still struggle on weakly textured, distant and geometrically ambiguous regions where defocus cues are most informative. We introduce BokehDepth, a two-stage framework that decouples bokeh synthesis from depth prediction and treats defocus as an auxiliary supervision-free geometric cue. In Stage-1, a physically guided controllable bokeh generator, built on a powerful pretrained image editing backbone, produces depth-free bokeh stacks with calibrated bokeh strength from a single sharp input. In Stage-2, a lightweight defocus-aware aggregation module plugs into existing monocular depth encoders, fuses features along the defocus dimension, and exposes stable depth-sensitive variations while leaving downstream decoder unchanged. Across challenging benchmarks, BokehDepth improves visual fidelity over depth-map-based bokeh baselines and consistently boosts the metric accuracy and robustness of strong monocular depth foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBokehDepth\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u6563\u666f\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u7126\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6563\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6563\u666f\u4e0e\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u8054\uff1a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6563\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u5f71\uff1b\u800c\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f31\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u6070\u6070\u79bb\u7126\u7ebf\u7d22\u6700\u6709\u6548\u3002", "method": "BokehDepth\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6563\u666f\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u6e05\u6670\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6563\u666f\u5806\u6808\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u79bb\u7126\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63a5\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u6cbf\u79bb\u7126\u7ef4\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cBokehDepth\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6563\u666f\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7126\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0cBokehDepth\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u8026\u6563\u666f\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8005\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA.

Sollie", "Arman Kilic", "Tuomas Sandholm"], "title": "Policy Optimization for Dynamic Heart Transplant Allocation", "comment": "An extended abstract of this paper was presented at the scientific sessions of AHA 2025", "summary": "Heart transplantation is a viable path for patients suffering from advanced heart failure, but this lifesaving option is severely limited due to donor shortage. Although the current allocation policy was recently revised in 2018, a major concern is that it does not adequately take into account pretransplant and post-transplant mortality. In this paper, we take an important step toward addressing these deficiencies.\n  To begin with, we use historical data from UNOS to develop a new simulator that enables us to evaluate and compare the performance of different policies. We then leverage our simulator to demonstrate that the status quo policy is considerably inferior to the myopic policy that matches incoming donors to the patient who maximizes the number of years gained by the transplant. Moreover, we develop improved policies that account for the dynamic nature of the allocation process through the use of potentials -- a measure of a patient's utility in future allocations that we introduce. We also show that batching together even a handful of donors -- which is a viable option for a certain type of donors -- further enhances performance.

Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%.

Such transitions may be anticipated by the emergence of a low-dimensional order parameter, whose signature is often masked by high-amplitude stochastic variability. Standard contrastive learning approaches based on deep neural networks, while promising for detecting critical transitions, are often overparameterized and sensitive to irrelevant noise, leading to inaccurate identification of critical points. To address these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture, constructed using singular value decomposition technique, together with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, to enhance the performance of traditional contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method matches the performance of traditional contrastive learning techniques in identifying critical transitions, yet is considerably more lightweight and markedly more resistant to noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u534a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u590d\u6742\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e34\u754c\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c2\u6570\u8fc7\u591a\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u65e0\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u88ab\u9ad8\u5e45\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u52a8\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\u6240\u6307\u793a\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u534a\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e34\u754c\u8f6c\u53d8\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5316\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ea6\u675f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Using CEEMDAN, we extract nine IMFs spanning high-frequency fluctuations to long-term trends. Each IMF is transformed into a graph using four time-series-to-graph methods: natural visibility, horizontal visibility, recurrence, and transition graphs. Topological analysis shows clear scale-dependent structure: high-frequency IMFs yield dense, highly connected small-world graphs, whereas low-frequency IMFs produce sparser networks with longer characteristic path lengths. Visibility-based methods are more sensitive to amplitude variability and typically generate higher clustering, while recurrence graphs better preserve temporal dependencies. These results provide guidance for designing GNN architectures tailored to the structural properties of decomposed components, supporting more effective predictive modeling of financial time series.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u89e3\uff08EMD\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eMSCI\u5168\u7403\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u6a21\u51fd\u6570\uff08IMFs\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7CEEMDAN\u63d0\u53d69\u4e2aIMF\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u65f6\u5e8f\u8f6c\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u7387IMF\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fe\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9488\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u914dGNN\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5206\u89e3\u540e\u5404\u5206\u91cf\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528CEEMDAN\u5206\u89e3MSCI World\u6307\u6570\u5f97\u52309\u4e2aIMFs\uff1b\u5206\u522b\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3001\u6c34\u5e73\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u56fe\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5404IMF\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u805a\u7c7b\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u9891IMF\u751f\u6210\u7a20\u5bc6\u3001\u9ad8\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u5c0f\u4e16\u754c\u7279\u6027\u56fe\uff1b\u4f4e\u9891IMF\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u56fe\uff1b\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u56fe\u5bf9\u632f\u5e45\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u91cd\u73b0\u56fe\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u4fdd\u7559\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "IMF\u5206\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u636e\u6b64\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1GNN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Small shifts in the behavior of these users are often sufficient to propagate widely throughout the network. A similar phenomenon occurs during neural network fine tuning. Conventional fine tuning of convolutional neural networks typically adds a new linear classification layer on top of a large pre trained model. Instead we argue that improved adaptation can be achieved by first pruning the network to retain only the most important neurons and then performing fine tuning.\n  We propose a graph theory based method for pruning neural networks that is designed to improve fine tuning performance. In this method each neuron is represented as a node and edges encode similarity between neurons. Neurons are pruned based on importance scores computed using eigenvector centrality. The resulting pruned network is then fine tuned using only the most central neurons.

Existing approaches struggle with the domain gap between controlled laboratory conditions and clinical practice, where adverse imaging conditions are prevalent. In this work, we propose AdaptiveDetector, a novel two-stage detector-verifier framework comprising a YOLOv11 detector with a vision-language model (VLM) verifier. The detector adaptively adjusts per-frame confidence thresholds under VLM guidance, while the verifier is fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using an asymmetric, cost-sensitive reward function specifically designed to discourage missed detections -- a critical clinical requirement. To enable realistic assessment under challenging conditions, we construct a comprehensive synthetic testbed by systematically degrading clean datasets with adverse conditions commonly encountered in clinical practice, providing a rigorous benchmark for zero-shot evaluation. Extensive zero-shot evaluation on synthetically degraded CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG images demonstrates that our approach improves recall by 14 to 22 percentage points over YOLO alone, while precision remains within 0.7 points below to 1.7 points above the baseline.

Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits.

In the standard setting, the optimal mistake bound is characterized by the Littlestone dimension $d$ of the concept class $H$ (Littlestone 1987). We prove that in the transductive setting, the mistake bound is at least $\u03a9(\\sqrt{d})$. This constitutes an exponential improvement over previous lower bounds of $\u03a9(\\log\\log d)$, $\u03a9(\\sqrt{\\log d})$, and $\u03a9(\\log d)$, due respectively to Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1995, 1997) and Hanneke, Moran, and Shafer (2023). We also show that this lower bound is tight: for every $d$, there exists a class of Littlestone dimension $d$ with transductive mistake bound $O(\\sqrt{d})$. Our upper bound also improves upon the best known upper bound of $(2/3)d$ from Ben-David, Kushilevitz, and Mansour (1997).

Hopkins"], "title": "On the Accuracy of Newton Step and Influence Function Data Attributions", "comment": null, "summary": "Data attribution aims to explain model predictions by estimating how they would change if certain training points were removed, and is used in a wide range of applications, from interpretability and credit assignment to unlearning and privacy.\n  Even in the relatively simple case of linear regressions, existing mathematical analyses of leading data attribution methods such as Influence Functions (IF) and single Newton Step (NS) remain limited in two key ways. First, they rely on global strong convexity assumptions which are often not satisfied in practice. Second, the resulting bounds scale very poorly with the number of parameters ($d$) and the number of samples removed ($k$). As a result, these analyses are not tight enough to answer fundamental questions such as \"what is the asymptotic scaling of the errors of each method?\" or \"which of these methods is more accurate for a given dataset?\"\n  In this paper, we introduce a new analysis of the NS and IF data attribution methods for convex learning problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of these questions that does not assume global strong convexity and also the first explanation of [KATL19] and [RH25a]'s observation that NS data attribution is often more accurate than IF. We prove that for sufficiently well-behaved logistic regression, our bounds are asymptotically tight up to poly-logarithmic factors, yielding scaling laws for the errors in the average-case sample removals.\n  \\[ \\mathbb{E}_{T \\subseteq [n],\\, |T| = k} \\bigl[ \\|\\hat\u03b8_T - \\hat\u03b8_T^{\\mathrm{NS}}\\|_2 \\bigr] = \\widetilde\u0398\\!\\left(\\frac{k d}{n^2}\\right), \\qquad \\mathbb{E}_{T \\subseteq [n],\\, |T| = k} \\bigl[ \\|\\hat\u03b8_T^{\\mathrm{NS}} - \\hat\u03b8_T^{\\mathrm{IF}}\\|_2 \\bigr] = \\widetilde\u0398\\!\\left( \\frac{(k + d)\\sqrt{k d}}{n^2} \\right). \\]", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u5f3a\u51f8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684NS\u548cIF\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u65b0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4f55NS\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4IF\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u7d27\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Influence Functions\u548cNewton Step\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5f3a\u51f8\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e14\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u968f\u53c2\u6570\u7ef4\u6570d\u548c\u5220\u9664\u6837\u672c\u6570k\u589e\u957f\u8fc7\u5feb\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b49\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u51f8\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u5f3a\u51f8\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfcNS\u4e0eIF\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6837\u672c\u5220\u9664\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u6e10\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86NS\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u0398\u0303(kd/n\u00b2)\uff0cNS\u4e0eIF\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a\u0398\u0303((k+d)\u221a(kd)/n\u00b2)\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u5185\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u7d27\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "NS\u5728\u591a\u6570\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eIF\uff0c\u5176\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9879\u66f4\u5c0f\uff1b\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u5f3a\u51f8\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

No claims of quantum advantage", "summary": "This paper presents an exploratory, simulator-based proof of concept investigating whether differentiable energy terms derived from parameterized quantum circuits can serve as auxiliary regularization signals in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We augment the Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) generator objective with a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)-inspired energy term computed from class-specific Ising Hamiltonians using Qiskit's EstimatorQNN and TorchConnector.\n  Important limitations: All experiments run on a noiseless statevector simulator with only 4 qubits, use a deliberately simple Hamiltonian parameterization, and lack ablation studies comparing against equivalent classical biases. The computational overhead (approximately 200x slower than classical ACGAN) reflects simulator artifacts rather than inherent quantum costs.\n  On MNIST, we observe that the energy-regularized model (termed QACGAN) achieves high classification accuracy (99 to 100 percent) within 5 epochs compared to 87.8 percent for ACGAN, suggesting the auxiliary term influences class conditioning. However, sample quality metrics (FID) show high variance across runs (coefficient of variation approximately 25 percent at epoch 5), with values ranging from 19.92 to 35.96. Extended runs stabilize around FID 23 to 24, comparable to the ACGAN baseline.\n  We explicitly do not claim quantum advantage, improved stability in any general sense, or scalability beyond this toy setting. The contribution is methodological: demonstrating that VQE-style energy computations can be integrated into GAN training loops via differentiable pathways. Whether such auxiliary signals provide benefits beyond equivalent classical regularizers remains an open question requiring systematic ablation studies, which we leave for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u672c\u5f81\u89e3\u7b97\u5668\uff08VQE\uff09\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u9879\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5165ACGAN\u751f\u6210\u5668\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08QACGAN\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0less\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u8bc1\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u6216\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ec5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u8def\u5f84\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7ebf\u8def\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u80fd\u91cf\u9879\u80fd\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GAN\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8f85\u52a9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728ACGAN\u751f\u6210\u5668\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9aIsing\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684VQE\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u80fd\u91cf\u9879\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Qiskit EstimatorQNN\u4e0eTorchConnector\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5fae\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u5168\u90e8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57284\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u65e0\u566a\u6001\u77e2\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u4e0a\uff0cQACGAN\u57285\u4e2aepoch\u5185\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe99\u2013100%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8eACGAN\u768487.8%\uff1b\u4f46FID\u6307\u6807\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\uff08\u7ea625%\uff09\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u4e3a23\u201324\uff0c\u4e0eACGAN\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7ea6200\u500d\uff08\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5f00\u9500\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u8bc1\u660eVQE\u5f0f\u80fd\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u8def\u5f84\u5d4c\u5165GAN\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b\u4e0d\u5ba3\u79f0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6216\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u540e\u7eed\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7b49\u6548\u7ecf\u5178\u6b63\u5219\u5668\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, reliable segmentation remains challenging because of small vessel calibers, complex branching, blurred boundaries, and myocardial interference. We propose a coronary artery segmentation framework that integrates myocardial anatomical priors, structure aware feature encoding, and three dimensional wavelet inverse wavelet transformations. Myocardial priors and residual attention based feature enhancement are incorporated during encoding to strengthen coronary structure representation. Wavelet inverse wavelet based downsampling and upsampling enable joint spatial frequency modeling and preserve multi scale structural consistency, while a multi scale feature fusion module integrates semantic and geometric information in the decoding stage. The model is trained and evaluated on the public ImageCAS dataset using a 3D overlapping patch based strategy with a 7:1:2 split for training, validation, and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.8082, Sensitivity of 0.7946, Precision of 0.8471, and an HD95 of 9.77 mm, outperforming several mainstream segmentation models. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary contributions of individual components.

We introduce Error-Free Linear Attention (EFLA), a numerically stable, fully parallelism and generalized formulation of the delta rule. Specifically, we formulate the online learning update as a continuous-time dynamical system and prove that its exact solution is not only attainable but also computable in linear time with full parallelism. By leveraging the rank-1 structure of the dynamics matrix, we directly derive the exact closed-form solution effectively corresponding to the infinite-order Runge-Kutta method.

We then design a contrastive learning objective that directly compares pairwise projections generated by the model.

Multiple natural views of the same video are created using different temporal frame samplings from the same underlying video.

Building upon this, recent studies extend the CoT mechanism to the visual modality, enabling models to integrate visual information during reasoning through external tools or explicit image generation. However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception-reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDMLR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u7ec7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff1b\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u7ec7\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDMLR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u2018\u601d\u8003token\u2019\uff1b2\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u5165\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6309\u9700\u68c0\u7d22\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6ce8\u5165\u5bf9\u5e94\u6f5c\u5728\u601d\u8003token\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u4ea4\u7ec7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cDMLR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DMLR\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to this domain is challenging due to the large number of video frames, resulting in high GPU memory usage and computational latency. To address these challenges, we propose token pruning as a means to reduce context length while retaining critical information. Specifically, we introduce a novel redundancy metric, Maximum Similarity to Spatially Adjacent Video Tokens (MSSAVT), which accounts for both token similarity and spatial position. To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned.

Existing defenses face a scalability trilemma: distance-based filtering (e.g., Krum) can reject legitimate Non-IID updates, geometric-median methods incur prohibitive $O(n^2 d)$ cost, and many certified defenses are evaluated only on models below 100M parameters. We propose Spectral Sentinel, a Byzantine detection and aggregation framework that leverages a random-matrix-theoretic signature: honest Non-IID gradients produce covariance eigenspectra whose bulk follows the Marchenko-Pastur law, while Byzantine perturbations induce detectable tail anomalies. Our algorithm combines Frequent Directions sketching with data-dependent MP tracking, enabling detection on models up to 1.5B parameters using $O(k^2)$ memory with $k \\ll d$. Under a $(\u03c3,f)$ threat model with coordinate-wise honest variance bounded by $\u03c3^2$ and $f < 1/2$ adversaries, we prove $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-Byzantine resilience with convergence rate $O(\u03c3f / \\sqrt{T} + f^2 / T)$, and we provide a matching information-theoretic lower bound $\u03a9(\u03c3f / \\sqrt{T})$, establishing minimax optimality.

At inference, MVP acquires a library of physical views per scene, selects the top-k sensor settings using a source-affinity score, evaluates each retained view under lightweight digital augmentations, filters the lowest-entropy subset of augmented views, and aggregates predictions with Zero-temperature softmax (i.e., hard voting). This selection-then-vote design is simple, calibration-friendly, and requires no gradients or model modifications. On ImageNet-ES and ImageNet-ES-Diverse, MVP consistently outperforms digital-only TTA on single Auto-Exposure captures, by up to 25.6 percentage points (pp), and delivers up to 3.4 pp additional gains over pipelines that combine conventional sensor control with TTA. MVP remains effective under reduced parameter candidate sets that lower capture latency, demonstrating practicality.

We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06prompt\u89c6\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91caprompt\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3001\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5806\u53e0\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6b65\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540cprompt\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "Prompt\u80fd\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u5176\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5c06prompt\u89c6\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7b80\u5316Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u5176\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eceprompt\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8def\u7531\uff0cFFN\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u672f\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5806\u53e0\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6b65\u7ec4\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6784\u9020\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5355\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9aTransformer\u4e3b\u5e72\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u8c03\u6574prompt\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e00\u5927\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316prompt\u957f\u5ea6/\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6743\u8861\u53ca\u7814\u7a76prompt\u5207\u6362\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6781\u9650\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u8d77\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002"}}

This is the extended version of the paper accepted at AAAI 2026, including related works and appendix", "summary": "Despite the rapid progress of deep learning in video action recognition (VAR) in recent years, privacy leakage in videos remains a critical concern. Current state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods often rely on anonymization. These methods suffer from (1) low concealment, where producing visually distorted videos that attract attackers' attention during transmission, and (2) spatiotemporal disruption, where degrading essential spatiotemporal features for accurate VAR. To address these issues, we propose StegaVAR, a novel framework that embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos and directly performs VAR in the steganographic domain for the first time. Throughout both data transmission and action analysis, the spatiotemporal information of hidden secret video remains complete, while the natural appearance of cover videos ensures the concealment of transmission. Considering the difficulty of steganographic domain analysis, we propose Secret Spatio-Temporal Promotion (STeP) and Cross-Band Difference Attention (CroDA) for analysis within the steganographic domain. STeP uses the secret video to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction in the steganographic domain during training. CroDA suppresses cover interference by capturing cross-band semantic differences. Experiments demonstrate that StegaVAR achieves superior VAR and privacy-preserving performance on widely used datasets. Moreover, our framework is effective for multiple steganographic models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faStegaVAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u9690\u5199\u57df\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u5d4c\u5165\u666e\u901a\u5c01\u9762\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u7136\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b8c\u6574\u4fdd\u7559\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u533f\u540d\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u853d\u6027\u4f4e\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u7834\u574f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u853d\u6027\u4f4e\uff08\u4ea7\u751f\u6613\u5f15\u8d77\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5931\u771f\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u7834\u574f\uff08\u5f71\u54cd\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff09\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStegaVAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Secret Spatio-Temporal Promotion (STeP) \u548c Cross-Band Difference Attention (CroDA) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u5199\u57df\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff1bSTeP\u5229\u7528\u79d8\u5bc6\u89c6\u9891\u6307\u5bfc\u9690\u5199\u57df\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0cCroDA\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u9891\u5e26\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u6291\u5236\u5c01\u9762\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cStegaVAR\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u9690\u5199\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "StegaVAR\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u5199\u57df\u5185\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Many studies suggest that introducing the SFT stage not only fails to improve reasoning ability but may also negatively impact model training. In this study, we revisit this RL-centric belief through a systematic and controlled comparison of SFT and RL on VLM Reasoning. Using identical data sources, we find that the relative effectiveness of SFT and RL is conditional and strongly influenced by model capacity, data scale, and data distribution. Contrary to common assumptions, our findings show that SFT plays a crucial role across several scenarios: (1) Effectiveness for weaker models. SFT more reliably elicits reasoning capabilities in smaller or weaker VLMs. (2) Data efficiency. SFT with only 2K achieves comparable or better reasoning performance to RL with 20K. (3) Cross-modal transferability. SFT demonstrates stronger generalization across modalities.

Noise-based regularizers such as Dropout and DropConnect address this issue by injecting stochastic perturbations during training, but the noise they apply is typically uniform across a layer or across a batch of samples, which can suppress both harmful and beneficial co-adaptation.\n  This work introduces PerNodeDrop, a lightweight stochastic regularization method. It applies per-sample, per-node perturbations to break the uniformity of the noise injected by existing techniques, thereby allowing each node to experience input-specific variability. Hence, PerNodeDrop preserves useful co-adaptation while applying regularization. This narrows the gap between training and validation performance and improves reliability on unseen data, as evident from the experiments.\n  Although superficially similar to DropConnect, PerNodeDrop operates at the sample level. It drops weights at the sample level, not the batch level. An expected-loss analysis formalizes how its perturbations attenuate excessive co-adaptation while retaining predictive interactions.

Depending on the temporal position of the query, the task is categorized into interpolation and extrapolation. Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context.

Presents methodology and preliminary experimental results", "summary": "Real-world deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is hindered by high computational demands, as existing architectures inefficiently process all tokens uniformly. We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6807\u8bb0\u526a\u679d\uff08ATP\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u5904\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6807\u8bb0\u8fdb\u884c\u5747\u5300\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6807\u8bb0\u526a\u679d\uff08ATP\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u5904\u878d\u5408ViT CLS\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08\u6a21\u5185\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff09\u4e0eCLIP\u56fe\u6587\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff08\u6a21\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4fdd\u7559Top-K\u6807\u8bb0\u8f93\u5165LLM\uff1b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9BLIP-2\u3001LLaVA\u3001Flamingo\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728VQAv2\u3001GQA\u3001COCO\u4e0a\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u63a8\u7406FLOPs\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea640%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63d0\u901f\u7ea61.5\u500d\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u4e8e1%\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u635f\u574f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ATP\u8bc1\u660e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u4e92\u65a5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While continuous-time bridges promise faster sampling, overparameterized neural networks describe their optimal dynamics, and the underlying stochastic differential equations can be difficult to integrate efficiently. This work introduces a novel paradigm that uses surrogate models to create simpler, faster, and more flexible approximations of these dynamics. We propose two specific algorithms: SINDy Flow Matching (SINDy-FM), which leverages sparse regression to identify interpretable, symbolic differential equations from data, and a Neural-ODE reformulation of the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (DSBM-NeuralODE) for flexible continuous-time parameterization.

Conventional advertisement layout techniques have predominantly relied on saliency mapping to detect salient regions within a background image, but such approaches often fail to fully account for the image's detailed composition and semantic content. To overcome this limitation, our method harnesses a VLM to recognize the products and other elements depicted in the background and to inform the placement of text and logos. The proposed layout-generation pipeline consists of two steps. In the first step, the VLM analyzes the image to identify object types and their spatial relationships, then produces a text-based \"placement plan\" based on this analysis. In the second step, that plan is rendered into the final layout by generating HTML-format code. We validated the effectiveness of our approach through evaluation experiments, conducting both quantitative and qualitative comparisons against existing methods. The results demonstrate that by explicitly considering the background image's content, our method produces noticeably higher-quality advertisement layouts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7VLM\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u5316\u201c\u5e03\u5c40\u65b9\u6848\u201d\uff0c\u518d\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3aHTML\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e03\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u5e03\u5c40\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6784\u6210\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e03\u5c40\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528VLM\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u2018\u653e\u7f6e\u8ba1\u5212\u2019\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u8be5\u8ba1\u5212\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3aHTML\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u80cc\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u5e03\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u662f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e03\u5c40\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Existing methods struggle to balance scene preservation with prompt adherence: they either replicate the scene with high fidelity but poor responsiveness to the prompt, or prioritize prompt compliance at the expense of scene consistency. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce two key contributions: (i) a scene-consistent data construction pipeline that generates diverse, geometrically-grounded training pairs, and (ii) a novel geometry-guided attention loss that leverages cross-view cues to regularize the model's spatial reasoning. Experiments on our scene-consistent benchmark show that our approach achieves better scene alignment and text-image consistency than state-of-the-art baselines, according to both automatic metrics and human preference studies.

Feature caching is effective since adjacent timesteps yield highly similar features. However, an inherent trade-off remains: aggressive timestep reuse offers large speedups but can easily cross the critical line, hurting fidelity, while block- or token-level reuse is safer but yields limited computational savings. We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss.

In order to exploit these structural dependencies, our approach integrates observations across all tasks and learns a global joint distribution, while still allowing personalised inference for new tasks. In this regard, we identify two key sources of epistemic uncertainty, namely structural uncertainty in the latent reward dependencies across arms and tasks, and user-specific uncertainty due to incomplete context and limited interaction history. To put our method into practice, we represent the joint distribution over tasks and rewards using a particle-based approximation of a log-density Gaussian process. This representation enables flexible, data-driven discovery of both inter-arm and inter-task dependencies without prior assumptions on the latent variables.

Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can produce human-readable explanations and facilitate feature analysis, potentially reducing the manual workload of fraud analysts and informing system refinements. However, they perform poorly when applied directly to tabular fraud detection due to the difficulty of reasoning over many features, the extreme class imbalance, and the absence of contextual information. To bridge this gap, we introduce FinFRE-RAG, a two-stage approach that applies importance-guided feature reduction to serialize a compact subset of numeric/categorical attributes into natural language and performs retrieval-augmented in-context learning over label-aware, instance-level exemplars. Across four public fraud datasets and three families of open-weight LLMs, FinFRE-RAG substantially improves F1/MCC over direct prompting and is competitive with strong tabular baselines in several settings. Although these LLMs still lag behind specialized classifiers, they narrow the performance gap and provide interpretable rationales, highlighting their value as assistive tools in fraud analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFinFRE-RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u964d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u56e0\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u6781\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5FinFRE-RAG\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ea6\u7b80\uff0c\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u6570\u503c/\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u793a\u4f8b\u5f00\u5c55\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6b3a\u8bc8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u7c7b\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cFinFRE-RAG\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5f3a\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u867d\u4ecd\u7565\u900a\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u5e45\u7f29\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "FinFRE-RAG\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u4e3a\u6b3a\u8bc8\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u517c\u5177\u4e00\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u51cf\u8f7b\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u4eba\u5de5\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Vanilla PINNs often under-enforce this constraint and produce unstable controls. We propose a Multi-Trajectory PINN (MT-PINN) that adds a rollout-based trajectory loss and propagates a terminal penalty on terminal inventory via backpropagation-through-time, directly enforcing zero terminal inventory. A lightweight lambda-curriculum is adopted to stabilize training as the state expands from a risk-neutral reduced HJB to a risk-averse HJB. On the Gatheral-Schied single-asset model, MT-PINN aligns closely with their derived closed-form solutions and concentrates terminal inventory tightly around zero while reducing errors along optimal paths. We apply MT-PINNs on SPY intraday data, matching TWAP when risk-neutral, and achieving lower exposure and competitive costs, especially in falling windows, for higher risk-aversion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MT-PINN\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5e26\u786c\u6027\u96f6\u7ec8\u7aef\u5e93\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4ea4\u6613\u6267\u884c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u65f6\u95f4\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u5f3a\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408lambda\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u771f\u5b9eSPY\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPINN\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5e26\u786c\u6027\u96f6\u7ec8\u7aef\u5e93\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4ea4\u6613\u6267\u884c\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u6ee1\u8db3\u8be5\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8f68\u8ff9PINN\uff08MT-PINN\uff09\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e rollout \u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u65f6\u95f4\uff08backpropagation-through-time\uff09\u5c06\u7ec8\u7aef\u5e93\u5b58\u60e9\u7f5a\u4f20\u64ad\u56de\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7 lambda-curriculum \u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u98ce\u9669\u4e2d\u6027\u7b80\u5316HJB\u9010\u6b65\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u98ce\u9669\u538c\u6076HJB\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gatheral-Schied\u5355\u8d44\u4ea7\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cMT-PINN\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7ec8\u7aef\u5e93\u5b58\u7d27\u5bc6\u805a\u96c6\u4e8e\u96f6\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u5728SPY\u76d8\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u4e2d\u6027\u65f6\u5339\u914dTWAP\uff0c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u538c\u6076\u4e0b\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e0b\u8dcc\u65f6\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u6301\u4ed3\u66b4\u9732\u4e0e\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "MT-PINN\u80fd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u7ea6\u675f\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u4ea4\u6613\u6267\u884c\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

An ab initio derivation of a regression method is proposed, starting from postulates of indifference. It is shown that if a probability measure on an infinite-dimensional function space possesses natural symmetries (invariance under translation, rotation, scaling, and Gaussianity), then the entire solution scheme, including the kernel form, the type of regularization, and the noise parameterization, follows analytically from these postulates. The resulting kernel coincides with a generalized polyharmonic spline; however, unlike existing approaches, it is not chosen empirically but arises as a consequence of the indifference principle. This result provides a theoretical foundation for a broad class of smoothing and interpolation methods, demonstrating their optimality in the absence of a priori information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u65e0\u504f\u6027\u516c\u8bbe\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u7f29\u653e\u53ca\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7b49\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6838\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5747\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u6838\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u591a\u8c03\u548c\u6837\u6761\uff0c\u4e14\u975e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9009\u53d6\u800c\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u65e0\u504f\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e0e\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u504f\u6027\uff08indifference\uff09\u516c\u8bbe\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7eaf\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5929\u7136\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u4e49\u591a\u8c03\u548c\u6837\u6761\u6838\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53ca\u566a\u58f0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5747\u7531\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u516c\u8bbe\u4e25\u683c\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u5927\u7c7b\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e0e\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u4e14\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Vol.102. No. 20", "summary": "This study provides an overview of heart disease prediction using an intelligent system. Predicting disease accurately is crucial in the medical field, but traditional methods relying solely on a doctor's experience often lack precision. To address this limitation, intelligent systems are applied as an alternative to traditional approaches. While various intelligent system methods exist, this study focuses on three: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). A comparison of these techniques in terms of accuracy was conducted, and ultimately, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) was selected for heart disease prediction. In the prediction phase, the heart disease dataset underwent data pre-processing to clean the data and data splitting to separate it into training and testing sets. The chosen intelligent system was then employed to predict heart disease outcomes based on the processed data. The experiment concluded with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) achieving a notable accuracy rate of 97.95% in predicting heart disease. The findings also revealed that the probability of heart disease was 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females.

Structural pruning, which reduces model size by removing redundant computational units such as neurons, has been widely explored as a solution, and this study devotes to input sparsification, an increasingly popular technique that improves efficiency by selectively activating only a subset of entry values for each input. However, existing approaches focus primarily on computational savings, often overlooking the representational consequences of sparsification and leaving a noticeable performance gap compared to full models. In this work, we first reinterpret input sparsification as a form of dynamic structural pruning.

By contrast, this paper is targeted at a more challenging scenario with large FoV disparity, to which directly applying current methods fails. We propose Crop and Alignment for cross-modal fundus image Registration(CARe), a very simple yet effective method. Specifically, given an OCTA with smaller FoV as a source image and a wide-field color fundus photograph (wfCFP) as a target image, our Crop operation exploits the physiological structure of the retina to crop from the target image a sub-image with its FoV roughly aligned with that of the source.

Overlooking this phenomenon, known as concept drift, can substantially degrade the predictive performance of the model. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue, as these parameters are typically fixed and lack the flexibility to dynamically adjust to evolving data. This paper introduces \"OLR-WAA: An Adaptive and Drift-Resilient Online Regression with Dynamic Weighted Average\", a hyperparameter-free model designed to tackle the challenges of non-stationary data streams and enable effective, continuous adaptation. The objective is to strike a balance between model stability and adaptability. OLR-WAA incrementally updates its base model by integrating incoming data streams, utilizing an exponentially weighted moving average. It further introduces a unique optimization mechanism that dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on real-time data characteristics. Rigorous evaluations show that it matches batch regression performance in static settings and consistently outperforms or rivals state-of-the-art online models, confirming its effectiveness.

Retrieval augmented generation feeds these public statistics into the OpenAI o3 model, which synthesises realistic yet private records. Each profile contains seven socio demographic variables and nine alternative attributes that describe phone specifications, online shopping rhythm, subscription spend, car ownership, monthly rent, and a credit card flag. To test the impact of the alternative financial data CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost are each trained in two versions. Demo models use only the socio demographic variables; Full models include both socio demographic and alternative attributes. Across five fold stratified validation the alternative block raises area under the curve by about one point three percentage and lifts balanced \\(F_{1}\\) from roughly 0.84 to 0.95, a fourteen percent gain. We contribute an open Istanbul 2025 Q1 synthetic dataset, a fully reproducible modeling pipeline, and empirical evidence that a concise set of behavioural attributes can approach bureau level discrimination power while serving borrowers who lack formal credit records.

Current methods, however, address speech-driven gestures or object interactions independently, limiting real-world applicability due to a lack of integrated, comprehensive datasets. To overcome this, we introduce InteracTalker, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates prompt-based object-aware interactions with co-speech gesture generation. We achieve this by employing a multi-stage training process to learn a unified motion, speech, and prompt embedding space. To support this, we curate a rich human-object interaction dataset, formed by augmenting an existing text-to-motion dataset with detailed object interaction annotations. Our framework utilizes a Generalized Motion Adaptation Module that enables independent training, adapting to the corresponding motion condition, which is then dynamically combined during inference. To address the imbalance between heterogeneous conditioning signals, we propose an adaptive fusion strategy, which dynamically reweights the conditioning signals during diffusion sampling.

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. This paper introduces Online Classification with Weighted Average (OLC-WA), an adaptive, hyperparameter-free online classification model equipped with an automated optimization mechanism. OLC-WA operates by blending incoming data streams with an existing base model. This blending is facilitated by an exponentially weighted moving average. Furthermore, an integrated optimization mechanism dynamically detects concept drift, quantifies its magnitude, and adjusts the model based on the observed data stream characteristics. This approach empowers the model to effectively adapt to evolving data distributions within streaming environments. Rigorous empirical evaluation across diverse benchmark datasets shows that OLC-WA achieves performance comparable to batch models in stationary environments, maintaining accuracy within 1-3%, and surpasses leading online baselines by 10-25% under drift, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to dynamic data streams.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578bOLC-WA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u878d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u52a8\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6f02\u79fb\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u5448\u73b0\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u901a\u5e38\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u6570\u636e\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOLC-WA\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u6307\u6570\u52a0\u6743\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u878d\u5408\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5185\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOLC-WA\u5728\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4ec51\u20133%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u65f6\u6bd4\u4e3b\u6d41\u5728\u7ebf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u534710\u201325%\u3002", "conclusion": "OLC-WA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

However, existing OW-DFA methods face two critical limitations: 1) A confidence skew that leads to unreliable pseudo-labels for novel forgeries, resulting in biased training. 2) An unrealistic assumption that the number of unknown forgery types is known *a priori*. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) framework, which adaptively balances model confidence across known and novel forgery types. CAL mainly consists of two components: Confidence-Aware Consistency Regularization (CCR) and Asymmetric Confidence Reinforcement (ACR). CCR mitigates pseudo-label bias by dynamically scaling sample losses based on normalized confidence, gradually shifting the training focus from high- to low-confidence samples. ACR complements this by separately calibrating confidence for known and novel classes through selective learning on high-confidence samples, guided by their confidence gap. Together, CCR and ACR form a mutually reinforcing loop that significantly improves the model's OW-DFA performance. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic Prototype Pruning (DPP) strategy that automatically estimates the number of novel forgery types in a coarse-to-fine manner, removing the need for unrealistic prior assumptions and enhancing the scalability of our methods to real-world OW-DFA scenarios. Extensive experiments on the standard OW-DFA benchmark and a newly extended benchmark incorporating advanced manipulations demonstrate that CAL consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on both known and novel forgery attribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u5f52\u56e0\uff08OW-DFA\uff09\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08CAL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08CCR\uff09\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\uff08ACR\uff09\u7f13\u89e3\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u539f\u578b\u526a\u679d\uff08DPP\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709OW-DFA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff08\u56e0\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u504f\u659c\uff09\u548c\u9700\u9884\u5148\u8bbe\u5b9a\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCAL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bCCR\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7f29\u653e\u635f\u5931\uff09\u4e0eACR\uff08\u4f9d\u636e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u6821\u51c6\u5df2\u77e5/\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1DPP\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u65b9\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u53ca\u6269\u5c55OW-DFA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5df2\u77e5\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CAL\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u6570\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86OW-DFA\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Additionally, in the realm of Online Learning, ensuring statistical significance is essential to validate continuous learning processes, particularly for achieving rapid convergence and effectively managing concept drifts in a timely manner. Robust statistical methods are needed to assess the significance of performance differences as data evolves over time. This article examines the state-of-the-art online regression models and empirically evaluates several suitable tests. To compare multiple online regression models across various datasets, we employed the Friedman test along with corresponding post-hoc tests.

In this work, we find that, when applying a transformer network model to a new target domain, the Query, Key, and Value features of its self-attention module often change significantly from those in the source domain, leading to substantial performance degradation of the transformer model. To address this important issue, we propose to develop a new approach to progressively recalibrate the self-attention at each layer using a local linear transform parameterized by conditioned scale and shift factors. We consider the online model adaptation from the source domain to the target domain as a progressive domain shift separation process. At each transformer network layer, we learn a Domain Separation Network to extract the domain shift feature, which is used to predict the scale and shift parameters for self-attention recalibration using a Factor Generator Network. These two lightweight networks are adapted online during inference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed progressive conditioned scale-shift recalibration (PCSR) method is able to significantly improve the online test-time domain adaptation performance by a large margin of up to 3.9\\% in classification accuracy on the ImageNet-C dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u7f29\u653e-\u504f\u79fb\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\uff08PCSR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2dQuery\u3001Key\u3001Value\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684Query\u3001Key\u3001Value\u7279\u5f81\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPCSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u5c42Transformer\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Domain Separation Network\u63d0\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Factor Generator Network\u9884\u6d4b\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7f29\u653e\u4e0e\u504f\u79fb\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-C\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPCSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5728\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u4e863.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "PCSR\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u5c42\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We evaluate the LRT on Sudoku as a controlled testbed for structured reasoning and show that it achieves strong performance, reaching 98.68% digit accuracy and 36.30% full-puzzle accuracy without using symbolic rules or search.

We propose TRACER (Transfer Learning-based Real-time Adaptation for Clinical Evolving Risk), a framework that identifies encounter-level transition membership and adapts predictive models using transfer learning without full retraining. In simulation studies, TRACER outperformed static models trained on historical or contemporary data. In a real-world application predicting hospital admission following emergency department visits across the COVID-19 transition, TRACER improved both discrimination and calibration. TRACER provides a scalable approach for maintaining robust predictive performance under evolving and heterogeneous clinical conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRACER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u4eba\u53e3\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982COVID-19\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u60a3\u8005\u5c31\u8bca\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u5224\u522b\u529b\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5de5\u5177\u5e38\u56e0\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6df7\u5408\u4eba\u7fa4\u8fc7\u6e21\u671f\uff09\u800c\u51fa\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7cfb\u7edf\u5347\u7ea7\u6216\u65b0\u53d1\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u5982COVID-19\uff09\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\u6784\u6210\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTRACER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u5355\u6b21\u5c31\u8bca\uff08encounter-level\uff09\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTRACER\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6025\u8bca\u5c31\u8bca\u540e\u4f4f\u9662\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u8de8\u8d8aCOVID-19\u8fc7\u6e21\u671f\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff08discrimination\uff09\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\uff08calibration\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "TRACER\u4e3a\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4fdd\u969c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose $\u03b2$-CLIP, a multi-granular text-conditioned contrastive learning framework designed to achieve hierarchical alignment between multiple textual granularities-from full captions to sentences and phrases-and their corresponding visual regions. For each level of granularity, $\u03b2$-CLIP utilizes cross-attention to dynamically pool image patches, producing contextualized visual embeddings. To address the semantic overlap inherent in this hierarchy, we introduce the $\u03b2$-Contextualized Contrastive Alignment Loss ($\u03b2$-CAL). This objective parameterizes the trade-off between strict query-specific matching and relaxed intra-image contextualization, supporting both soft Cross-Entropy and hard Binary Cross-Entropy formulations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $\u03b2$-CLIP significantly improves dense alignment: achieving 91.8% T2I 92.3% I2T at R@1 on Urban1K and 30.9% on FG-OVD (Hard), setting state-of-the-art among methods trained without hard negatives. $\u03b2$-CLIP establishes a robust, adaptive baseline for dense vision-language correspondence.

In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze this phenomenon for geometric data, which we represent as discrete samples from a continuous source (e.g., point clouds from manifolds, graphs from graphons). Our core contribution is a bound on the error between the Transformer's output for a discrete sample and its continuous-domain equivalent.

We consider a setting in which a model provider distributes trained models to multiple clients whose devices support local inference but lack the ability to retrain those models, placing the burden of performance maintenance on the provider. We introduce a model-agnostic framework that captures the interaction between resource allocation, concept drift dynamics, and deployment timing. We show that optimal training policies depend critically on the aging properties of concept durations. Under sudden concept changes, we derive optimal training policies subject to budget constraints when concept durations follow distributions with Decreasing Mean Residual Life (DMRL), and show that intuitive heuristics are provably suboptimal under Increasing Mean Residual Life (IMRL). We further study model deployment under communication constraints, prove that the associated optimization problem is quasi-convex under mild conditions, and propose a randomized scheduling strategy that achieves near-optimal client-side performance. These results offer theoretical and algorithmic foundations for cost-efficient ML model management under concept drift, with implications for continual learning, distributed inference, and adaptive ML systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6982\u5ff5\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff08DMRL/IMRL\uff09\u5bf9\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fd1\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8bbe\u5907\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u9700\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ef4\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90-\u6f02\u79fb-\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5e8f\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff08DMRL/IMRL\u6027\u8d28\u5206\u6790\uff09\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u62df\u51f8\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd1\u4f18\u90e8\u7f72\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u5728\u7a81\u53d1\u6982\u5ff5\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9DMRL\u5206\u5e03\u7ed9\u51fa\u5e26\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2\uff09\u8bc1\u660eIMRL\u4e0b\u5e38\u89c1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u4e25\u683c\u6b21\u4f18\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u62df\u51f8\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f18\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548ML\u6a21\u578b\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6491\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94ML\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, some human parts in many video frames cannot be seen due to off-screen captures or occlusions. It brings a dilemma: discarding the data missing any part limits scale and diversity, while retaining it compromises data quality and model performance.\n  To address this problem, we propose leveraging credible part-level data extracted from videos to enhance motion generation via a robust part-aware masked autoregression model. First, we decompose a human body into five parts and detect the parts clearly seen in a video frame as \"credible\". Second, the credible parts are encoded into latent tokens by our proposed part-aware variational autoencoder. Third, we propose a robust part-level masked generation model to predict masked credible parts, while ignoring those noisy parts.\n  In addition, we contribute K700-M, a challenging new benchmark comprising approximately 200k real-world motion sequences, for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our method successfully outperforms baselines on both clean and noisy datasets in terms of motion quality, semantic consistency and diversity.

We investigate a potential topological constraint: when the prior distribution and target distribution have mismatched topology (e.g., unimodal to multimodal), the optimal velocity field under standard flow matching objectives may exhibit spatial discontinuities. We suggest that this discontinuity arises from the requirement that continuous flows must bifurcate to map a single mode to multiple modes, forcing particles to make discrete routing decisions at intermediate times. Through theoretical analysis on bimodal Gaussian mixtures, we demonstrate that the optimal velocity field exhibits jump discontinuities along decision boundaries, with magnitude approaching infinity as time approaches the target distribution. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon is not specific to $L^2$ loss, but rather may be a consequence of topological mismatch between distributions.

It is important to restore the 3D shape of the human body and estimate the spine center line. Existing mul-ti-image-based body restoration methods require expensive equipment and complex pro-cedures, and single image-based body restoration methods have limitations in that it is difficult to accurately estimate the internal structure such as the spine center line due to occlusion and viewpoint limitation. This study proposes a method to compensate for the shortcomings of the multi-image-based method and to solve the limitations of the sin-gle-image method. We propose a 3D body posture analysis system that integrates depth images from four directions to restore a 3D human model and automatically estimate the spine center line.

Given the stringent reliability demands of applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving, robust detection of such adversarial attacks is paramount. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of a model's input loss landscape. We analyze the Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of the model's gradient parameters, which quantifies the minimal number of coordinates required to describe the data points on their underlying manifold. We reveal a distinct and consistent difference in the ID for natural and adversarial data, which forms the basis of our proposed detection method. We validate our approach across two distinct operational scenarios. First, in a batch-wise context for identifying malicious data groups, our method demonstrates high efficacy on datasets like MNIST and SVHN. Second, in the critical individual-sample setting, we establish new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and MS COCO. Our detector significantly surpasses existing methods against a wide array of attacks, including CW and AutoAttack, achieving detection rates consistently above 92\\% on CIFAR-10.

However, existing methods often rely on a single diffusion model to directly map driving actions to videos, which makes learning difficult and leads to physically inconsistent outputs. To overcome these challenges, we propose GenieDrive, a novel framework designed for physics-aware driving video generation. Our approach starts by generating 4D occupancy, which serves as a physics-informed foundation for subsequent video generation. 4D occupancy contains rich physical information, including high-resolution 3D structures and dynamics. To facilitate effective compression of such high-resolution occupancy, we propose a VAE that encodes occupancy into a latent tri-plane representation, reducing the latent size to only 58% of that used in previous methods. We further introduce Mutual Control Attention (MCA) to accurately model the influence of control on occupancy evolution, and we jointly train the VAE and the subsequent prediction module in an end-to-end manner to maximize forecasting accuracy. Together, these designs yield a 7.2% improvement in forecasting mIoU at an inference speed of 41 FPS, while using only 3.47 M parameters. Additionally, a Normalized Multi-View Attention is introduced in the video generation model to generate multi-view driving videos with guidance from our 4D occupancy, significantly improving video quality with a 20.7% reduction in FVD. Experiments demonstrate that GenieDrive enables highly controllable, multi-view consistent, and physics-aware driving video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGenieDrive\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u76844D\u5360\u7528\uff08occupancy\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u751f\u6210\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u52a8\u4f5c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u89c4\u5212\u3001OOD\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGenieDrive\uff1a1\uff09\u5148\u751f\u6210\u542b\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u76844D occupancy\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cfVAE\u5c06\u5176\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u6f5c\u8868\u793a\uff08latent size\u51cf\u5c11\u81f358%\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e92\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08MCA\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9occupancy\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b4\uff09\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3VAE\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b5\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5occupancy\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9884\u6d4bmIoU\u4e0a\u63d0\u53477.2%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe41 FPS\uff0c\u4ec5\u75283.47M\u53c2\u6570\uff1bFVD\u964d\u4f4e20.7%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "GenieDrive\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\uff084D occupancy\uff09\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This research develops a framework for network level evaluation of hangup susceptibility of HRGCs. Profile data from different crossings in Oklahoma were collected using both a walking profiler and the Pave3D8K Laser Imaging System. A hybrid deep learning model, combining Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures, was developed to reconstruct accurate HRGC profiles from Pave3D8K Laser Imaging System data. Vehicle dimension data from around 350 specialty vehicles were collected at various locations across Oklahoma to enable up to date statistical design dimensions. Hangup susceptibility was analyzed using three vehicle dimension scenarios (a) median dimension (median wheelbase and ground clearance), (b) 75 25 percentile dimension (75 percentile wheelbase, 25 percentile ground clearance), and (c) worst case dimension (maximum wheelbase and minimum ground clearance).

Despite its potential, VFL is susceptible to feature inference attacks, in which adversarial parties exploit shared confidence scores (i.e., prediction probabilities) during inference to reconstruct private input features of other participants. To counter this threat, we propose PRIVEE (PRIvacy-preserving Vertical fEderated lEarning), a novel defense mechanism named after the French word priv\u00e9e, meaning \"private.\" PRIVEE obfuscates confidence scores while preserving critical properties such as relative ranking and inter-score distances.

The framework formulates uncertainty control as a two-stage problem: the first stage selects confident samples for prediction, and the second stage applies conformal risk control on the selected subset to construct calibrated prediction sets. We develop two algorithms under this framework. The first, SCRC-T, preserves exchangeability by computing thresholds jointly over calibration and test samples, offering exact finite-sample guarantees. The second, SCRC-I, is a calibration-only variant that provides PAC-style probabilistic guarantees while being more computational efficient. Experiments on two public datasets show that both methods achieve the target coverage and risk levels, with nearly identical performance, while SCRC-I exhibits slightly more conservative risk control but superior computational practicality. Our results demonstrate that selective conformal risk control offers an effective and efficient path toward compact, reliable uncertainty quantification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSelective Conformal Risk Control (SCRC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u6837\u672c\u7b5b\u9009+\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5SCRC-T\uff08\u7cbe\u786e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff09\u548cSCRC-I\uff08PAC\u98ce\u683c\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e8c\u8005\u5747\u6ee1\u8db3\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14SCRC-I\u66f4\u5177\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u867d\u5177\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCRC\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u9009\u5b9a\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65bd\u5171\u5f62\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014SCRC-T\uff08\u8054\u5408\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff09\u548cSCRC-I\uff08\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9bPAC\u98ce\u683c\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bSCRC-I\u7565\u663e\u4fdd\u5b88\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "SCRC\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have emerged as a promising solution, offering explicit control, high interpretability, and real-time rendering capabilities (>1000 FPS). However, high-quality 2DGS typically requires post-optimization. Existing methods adopt random or heuristics (e.g., gradient maps), which are often insensitive to image complexity and lead to slow convergence (>10s). More recent approaches introduce learnable networks to predict initial Gaussian configurations, but at the cost of increased computational and architectural complexity. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-2DGS, a lightweight framework for efficient Gaussian image representation. Specifically, we introduce Deep Gaussian Prior, implemented as a conditional network to capture the spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives under different complexities. In addition, we propose an attribute regression network to predict dense Gaussian properties. Experiments demonstrate that this disentangled architecture achieves high-quality reconstruction in a single forward pass, followed by minimal fine-tuning. More importantly, our approach significantly reduces computational cost without compromising visual quality, bringing 2DGS closer to industry-ready deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFast-2DGS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76842D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67092D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\uff082DGS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u914d\u7f6e\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u68af\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u5e26\u6765\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFast-2DGS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09Deep Gaussian Prior\u2014\u2014\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2\uff09\u5c5e\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u7edc\u2014\u2014\u9884\u6d4b\u7a20\u5bc6\u9ad8\u65af\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u4e3a\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u6781\u5c11\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\uff08\u8fdc\u5feb\u4e8e>10s\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u9ad8\uff08>1000 FPS\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Fast-2DGS\u4e3a2D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5411\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Yet LLMs often exhibit variability when prompts are phrased with minor differences, even when semantically equivalent. Such inconsistency undermines trust, complicates compliance, and disrupts user experience. While personalization is desirable in certain contexts, many enterprise scenarios-such as HR onboarding, customer support, or policy disclosure-require invariant information delivery regardless of phrasing or prior conversational history. Existing approaches, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and temperature tuning, improve factuality or reduce stochasticity but cannot guarantee stability across equivalent prompts. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly optimize for consistency. Unlike prior applications of GRPO, which have been limited to reasoning and code generation, we adapt GRPO to enforce stability of information content across groups of semantically equivalent prompts. We introduce entropy-based helpfulness and stability rewards, treating prompt variants as groups and resetting conversational context to isolate phrasing effects. Experiments on investment and job recommendation tasks show that our GRPO-trained model reduces variability more effectively than fine-tuning or decoding-based baselines.

However, most existing methods rely solely on the previous frame's features to predict temporal context, leading to two critical issues. First, the short reference window misses long-term dependencies and fine texture details. Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faL-STEC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LSTM\u6269\u5c55\u53c2\u8003\u94fe\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u50cf\u7d20\u57df\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u524d\u4e00\u5e27\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u53ca\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u65f6-\u7a7a\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08L-STEC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528LSTM\u6269\u5c55\u53c2\u8003\u94fe\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u50cf\u7d20\u57df\u626d\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u7f51\u7edc\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728PSNR\u548cMS-SSIM\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4DCVC-TCM\u8282\u770137.01%\u548c31.65%\u7801\u7387\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8aVTM-17.0\u4e0eDCVC-FM\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "L-STEC\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u65f6\u4e0e\u7a7a\u65f6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose DrivePI, a novel spatial-aware 4D MLLM that serves as a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that is also compatible with vision-action (VA) models. Our method jointly performs spatial understanding, 3D perception (i.e., 3D occupancy), prediction (i.e., occupancy flow), and planning (i.e., action outputs) in parallel through end-to-end optimization. To obtain both precise geometric information and rich visual appearance, our approach integrates point clouds, multi-view images, and language instructions within a unified MLLM architecture. We further develop a data engine to generate text-occupancy and text-flow QA pairs for 4D spatial understanding. Remarkably, with only a 0.5B Qwen2.5 model as MLLM backbone, DrivePI as a single unified model matches or exceeds both existing VLA models and specialized VA models. Specifically, compared to VLA models, DrivePI outperforms OpenDriveVLA-7B by 2.5% mean accuracy on nuScenes-QA and reduces collision rate by 70% over ORION (from 0.37% to 0.11%) on nuScenes. Against specialized VA models, DrivePI surpasses FB-OCC by 10.3 RayIoU for 3D occupancy on OpenOcc, reduces the mAVE from 0.591 to 0.509 for occupancy flow on OpenOcc, and achieves 32% lower L2 error than VAD (from 0.72m to 0.49m) for planning on nuScenes.

The final version may differ from this version", "summary": "Recent advancements in image synthesis have enabled high-quality image generation and manipulation. Most works focus on: 1) conditional manipulation, where an image is modified conditioned on a given attribute, or 2) disentangled representation learning, where each latent direction should represent a distinct semantic attribute. In this paper, we focus on a different and less studied research problem, called Contrastive Analysis (CA). Given two image datasets, we want to separate the common generative factors, shared across the two datasets, from the salient ones, specific to only one dataset. Compared to existing methods, which use attributes as supervised signals for editing (e.g., glasses, gender), the proposed method is weaker, since it only uses the dataset signal. We propose a novel framework for CA, that can be adapted to both GAN and Diffusion models, to learn both common and salient factors.

Learning accurate switching dynamical system models can reveal how behavior is encoded in neural activity. Existing switching approaches have primarily focused on learning models from a single neural modality, either continuous Gaussian signals or discrete Poisson signals. However, multiple neural modalities are often recorded simultaneously to measure different spatiotemporal scales of brain activity, and all these modalities can encode behavior. Moreover, regime labels are typically unavailable in training data, posing a significant challenge for learning models of regime-dependent switching dynamics. To address these challenges, we develop a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the parameters of switching multiscale dynamical system models using only multiscale neural observations. We demonstrate our method using both simulations and two distinct experimental datasets with multimodal spike-LFP observations during different motor tasks. We find that our switching multiscale dynamical system models more accurately decode behavior than switching single-scale dynamical models, showing the success of multiscale neural fusion. Further, our models outperform stationary multiscale models, illustrating the importance of tracking regime-dependent non-stationarity in multimodal neural data. The developed unsupervised learning framework enables more accurate modeling of complex multiscale neural dynamics by leveraging information in multimodal recordings while incorporating regime switches. This approach holds promise for improving the performance and robustness of brain-computer interfaces over time and for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5207\u6362\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u5c16\u5cf0\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u573a\u7535\u4f4d\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5207\u6362\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u884c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u9759\u6001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u6216\u6cca\u677e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u5207\u6362\uff1b\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u795e\u7ecf\u8bb0\u5f55\u5e38\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e14\u72b6\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u80fd\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5207\u6362 regime \u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u5982 spike-LFP\uff09\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u5207\u6362\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700 regime \u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5207\u6362\u5355\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9759\u6001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u523b\u753b\u590d\u6742\u3001\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5316\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Accepted to VISAPP 2026", "summary": "Large-scale multimodal foundation models, particularly Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), have achieved state-of-the-art results by unifying contrastive alignment with generative captioning. While zero-shot transfer capabilities are well-documented, the adaptation of these generative-contrastive hybrids to downstream tasks with extreme data scarcity (few-shot learning) remains under-explored. Existing literature predominantly focuses on dual-encoder architectures like CLIP, leaving a gap in understanding how CoCa's distinct latent space responds to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on adapting the CoCa visual backbone for few-shot image classification. We systematically evaluate a hierarchy of strategies, ranging from training-free hybrid prototyping to deep parameter adaptation via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). First, we identify an \"augmentation divergence\": while strong data augmentation degrades the performance of linear probing in low-shot settings, it is essential for stabilizing LoRA fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that hybrid objectives incorporating Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) loss yield consistent performance improvements over standard Cross-Entropy across varying shot counts. Crucially, we characterize the sensitivity of training configurations to data scarcity, providing empirical reference settings for scaling regularization, rank, and sampling strategies to facilitate the efficient adaptation of generative-contrastive foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86CoCa\u8fd9\u7c7b\u751f\u6210-\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6df7\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff08few-shot\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488 vs LoRA\uff09\u6709\u76f8\u53cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408SupCon\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u914d\u7f6e\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8eCLIP\u7b49\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9CoCa\u8fd9\u7c7b\u751f\u6210-\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9CoCa\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5f00\u5c55\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u539f\u578b\u6cd5\u5230LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u5f15\u5165SupCon\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8003\u5bdf\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001LoRA\u79e9\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u7a33\u5b9aLoRA\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1bSupCon\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u6570\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u79e9\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u968f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u9002\u914d\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "CoCa\u7b49\u751f\u6210-\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316PEFT\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982LoRA+SupCon\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u9700\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

Why Do Reasoning Models Loop?", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) generate long chains of thought to solve harder problems, but they often loop, repeating the same text at low temperatures or with greedy decoding. We study why this happens and what role temperature plays. With open reasoning models, we find that looping is common at low temperature. Larger models tend to loop less, and distilled students loop significantly even when their teachers rarely do. This points to mismatches between the training distribution and the learned model, which we refer to as errors in learning, as a key cause. To understand how such errors cause loops, we introduce a synthetic graph reasoning task and demonstrate two mechanisms. First, risk aversion caused by hardness of learning: when the correct progress-making action is hard to learn but an easy cyclic action is available, the model puts relatively more probability on the cyclic action and gets stuck. Second, even when there is no hardness, Transformers show an inductive bias toward temporally correlated errors, so the same few actions keep being chosen and loops appear. Higher temperature reduces looping by promoting exploration, but it does not fix the errors in learning, so generations remain much longer than necessary at high temperature; in this sense, temperature is a stopgap rather than a holistic solution. We end with a discussion of training-time interventions aimed at directly reducing errors in learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DeepSeek-R1\uff09\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u65f6\u9891\u7e41\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff08\u5373\u2018\u5b66\u4e60\u9519\u8bef\u2019\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u503e\u5411\u548cTransformer\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u9519\u8bef\u504f\u5dee\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u9ad8\u6e29\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u7f13\u89e3\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u6cbb\u5b66\u4e60\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c42\u9762\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u6216\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u91cd\u590d\u6587\u672c\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u6210\u56e0\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6839\u672c\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u6e90\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0eTransformer\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5faa\u73af\u666e\u904d\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5faa\u73af\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5374\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u6613\u5faa\u73af\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u89c4\u907f\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u9519\u8bef\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u9ad8\u6e29\u4ec5\u7f13\u89e3\u800c\u975e\u6d88\u9664\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5faa\u73af\u4e3b\u56e0\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8986\u76d6\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u2018\u5b66\u4e60\u9519\u8bef\u2019\uff0c\u6e29\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u4ec5\u4e3a\u6743\u5b9c\u4e4b\u8ba1\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u89e3\u51b3\u9700\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u6b64\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u3002"}}

The current state of the scenario is assumed to be known from sensors and the prediction is taking into account various hypotheses about the behavior of traffic participants. This way, the uncertainties regarding the behavior of traffic participants can be modelled in detail. In the first part of this paper a model-based approach is presented to compute Predicted-Occupancy Grids (POG), which are introduced as a grid-based probabilistic representation of the future scenario hypotheses. However, due to the large number of possible trajectories for each traffic participant, the model-based approach comes with a very high computational load. Thus, a machine-learning approach is adopted for the computation of POGs. This work uses a novel grid-based representation of the current state of the traffic scenario and performs the mapping to POGs. This representation consists of augmented cells in an occupancy grid.

This versatile framework also supports multi-view inputs, auxiliary pixel-level supervision, and interpretable heatmap generation. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 12 tasks covering diverse pathologies, anatomies, and modalities, and systematically analyze state-of-the-art 3D classification techniques. Our analysis reveals key insights: (1) effective adaptation is essential to unlock FM potential, (2) general-purpose FMs can match medical-specific FMs if properly adapted, and (3) 2D-based methods surpass 3D architectures for 3D classification.

In order to predict the future space-time representation of the traffic scenario, first the type of traffic scenario is identified and then the machine learning algorithm maps the current state of the scenario to possible future states. The input to the machine learning algorithms is the current state representation of a traffic scenario, termed as the Augmented Occupancy Grid (AOG). The output is the probabilistic space-time representation which includes uncertainties regarding the behaviour of the traffic participants and is termed as the Predicted Occupancy Grid (POG). The novel architecture consists of two Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAs) and a set of Random Forests.

To further enhance efficiency, Hierarchical Group Quantization (HGQ) combines coarse-grained floating-point scaling with fine-grained shifting, effectively reducing dequantization cost. Also, SVD-guided mixed precision (SVD-MP) statically allocates higher bitwidths to precision-sensitive components identified through low-rank decomposition, thereby minimizing floating-point operation cost.

Specifically, given some labeled data of known classes, GCD aims to cluster unlabeled data that contain both known and unknown classes. Current GCD methods based on parametric classification adopt the DINO-like pseudo-labeling strategy, where the sharpened probability output of one view is used as supervision information for the other view. However, large pre-trained models have a preference for some specific visual patterns, resulting in encoding spurious correlation for unlabeled data and generating noisy pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, which contains two modules: Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS). LSP enhances the robustness of model parameters to small perturbations by minimizing the worst-case loss sharpness of the model, which suppressing the encoding of trivial features, thereby reducing overfitting of noise samples and improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, DAS selects representative samples for the unknown classes based on KNN density and class probability during the model training and assigns hard pseudo-labels to them, which not only alleviates the confidence difference between known and unknown classes but also enables the model to quickly learn more accurate feature distribution for the unknown classes, thus further improving the clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the noise of pseudo-labels, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple GCD benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u53d1\u73b0\uff08GCD\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u635f\u5931\u9510\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\uff08LSP\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u951a\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\uff08DAS\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u805a\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eDINO\u5f0f\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u53d7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f16\u7801\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u751f\u6210\u566a\u58f0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoss Sharpness Penalty\uff08LSP\uff09\u6291\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u7410\u788e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7f16\u7801\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1Dynamic Anchor Selection\uff08DAS\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eKNN\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u6982\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u53d6\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u8d4b\u4e88\u786c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aGCD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LSP\u4e0eDAS\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u52a8GCD\u4efb\u52a1\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, such models often rely on millions to billions of training sequences and billions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive computational costs and significant barriers to reproducibility and accessibility, particularly for academic labs. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of data pruning for BioFM pretraining and propose a post-hoc influence-guided data pruning framework tailored to biological domains. Our approach introduces a subset-based self-influence formulation that enables efficient estimation of sample importance at low computational cost, and builds upon it two simple yet effective selection strategies, namely Top-k Influence (Top I) and Coverage-Centric Influence (CCI). We empirically validate our method on two representative BioFMs, RNA-FM and ESM-C. For RNA, our framework consistently outperforms random selection baselines under an extreme pruning rate of over 99 percent, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our framework on protein-related tasks using ESM-C. In particular, our coreset even outperforms random subsets that are ten times larger in both RNA and protein settings, revealing substantial redundancy in biological sequence datasets. These findings underscore the potential of influence-guided data pruning to substantially reduce the computational cost of BioFM pretraining, paving the way for more efficient, accessible, and sustainable biological AI research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5f71\u54cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u7269\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08BioFM\uff09\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709BioFM\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d77\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u5b66\u672f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6784\u6210\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u81ea\u5f71\u54cd\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1Top-k Influence\uff08Top I\uff09\u548cCoverage-Centric Influence\uff08CCI\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728RNA-FM\u548cESM-C\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u5728>99%\u526a\u679d\u7387\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u6240\u9009\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e10\u500d\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f71\u54cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u526a\u679d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eBioFM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u53ca\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u751f\u7269AI\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often fall short in modeling temporal dependencies across multiple events and in handling queries that reference unseen or rare visual concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce MADTempo, a video retrieval framework developed by our team, AIO_Trinh, that unifies temporal search with web-scale visual grounding. Our temporal search mechanism captures event-level continuity by aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments, enabling coherent retrieval of multi-event queries. Complementarily, a Google Image Search-based fallback module expands query representations with external web imagery, effectively bridging gaps in pretrained visual embeddings and improving robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) queries.

Despite its advantage in visualizations, the large storage size of Cryo-EM data file poses significant challenges for researchers and educators. This paper investigates the application of deep learning, specifically implicit neural representation (INR), to compress Cryo-EM biological data. The proposed approach first extracts the binary map of each file according to the density threshold. The density map is highly repetitive, ehich can be effectively compressed by GZIP. The neural network then trains to encode spatial density information, allowing the storage of network parameters and learnable latent vectors. To improve reconstruction accuracy, I further incorporate the positional encoding to enhance spatial representation and a weighted Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to balance density distribution variations.

This reliance adds engineering complexity and hyperparameter tuning, while also lacking a direct data-driven gradient signal, which might result in sub-optimal compression. In this paper, we introduce CoDeQ, a simple, fully differentiable method for joint pruning--quantization. Our approach builds on a key observation: the dead-zone of a scalar quantizer is equivalent to magnitude pruning, and can be used to induce sparsity directly within the quantization operator. Concretely, we parameterize the dead-zone width and learn it via backpropagation, alongside the quantization parameters. This design provides explicit control of sparsity, regularized by a single global hyperparameter, while decoupling sparsity selection from bit-width selection. The result is a method for Compression with Dead-zone Quantizer (CoDeQ) that supports both fixed-precision and mixed-precision quantization (controlled by an optional second hyperparameter). It simultaneously determines the sparsity pattern and quantization parameters in a single end-to-end optimization. Consequently, CoDeQ does not require any auxiliary procedures, making the method architecture-agnostic and straightforward to implement.

Existing methods employ convolutional or self-attention blocks to capture the multi-scale features in the segmentation models, while the inherent gap of the feature pyramids and insufficient global-local feature integration leads to inaccurate, ambiguous extraction results. To address this issue, in this paper, we present an Uncertainty-Aggregated Global-Local Fusion Network (UAGLNet), which is capable to exploit high-quality global-local visual semantics under the guidance of uncertainty modeling. Specifically, we propose a novel cooperative encoder, which adopts hybrid CNN and transformer layers at different stages to capture the local and global visual semantics, respectively. An intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) is designed to narrow the gap between the local and global features when the network becomes deeper. Afterwards, we propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module to complementarily fuse the global and local representations. Moreover, to mitigate the segmentation ambiguity in uncertain regions, we propose an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) to explicitly estimate the pixel-wise uncertainty to enhance the segmentation accuracy.

However, MMDI relies on the Helmholtz equation, which assumes wave propagation in a uniform, homogeneous, and infinite medium. Furthermore, the use of the Laplacian operator makes MMDI highly sensitive to noise, which compromises the accuracy and reliability of stiffness estimates. In this study, we propose the Deep-Learning driven Inversion Framework for Shear Modulus Estimation in MRE (DIME), aimed at enhancing the robustness of inversion. DIME is trained on the displacement fields-stiffness maps pair generated through Finite Element Modelling (FEM) simulations. To capture local wave behavior and improve robustness to global image variations, DIME is trained on small image patches. We first validated DIME using homogeneous and heterogeneous datasets simulated with FEM, where DIME produced stiffness maps with low inter-pixel variability, accurate boundary delineation, and higher correlation with ground truth (GT) compared to MMDI. Next, DIME was evaluated in a realistic anatomy-informed simulated liver dataset with known GT and compared directly to MMDI. DIME reproduced ground-truth stiffness patterns with high fidelity (r = 0.99, R^2 = 0.98), while MMDI showed greater underestimation. After validating DIME on synthetic data, we tested the model in in vivo liver MRE data from eight healthy and seven fibrotic subjects. DIME preserved physiologically consistent stiffness patterns and closely matched MMDI, which showed directional bias. Overall, DIME showed higher correlation with ground truth and visually similar stiffness patterns, whereas MMDI displayed a larger bias that can potentially be attributed to directional filtering. These preliminary results highlight the feasibility of DIME for clinical applications in MRE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u526a\u5207\u6a21\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6DIME\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u5f39\u6027\u6210\u50cf\uff08MRE\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edfMultimodal Direct Inversion\uff08MMDI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002DIME\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4MMDI\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u751f\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMMDI\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8eHelmholtz\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u4ecb\u8d28\u5747\u5300\u65e0\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u526a\u5207\u521a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684DIME\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5efa\u6a21\uff08FEM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a-\u521a\u5ea6\u56fe\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce2\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6297\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5747\u5300\u3001\u975e\u5747\u5300\u53ca\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u809d\u810f\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cDIME\u8f83MMDI\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u521a\u5ea6\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u66f4\u4f4e\u50cf\u7d20\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e0e\u771f\u503c\u76f8\u5173\u6027r=0.99, R\u00b2=0.98\uff09\uff1b\u57288\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0e7\u540d\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u4f53\u5185MRE\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0cDIME\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u521a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0MMDI\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "DIME\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u521d\u6b65\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eMMDI\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5411MRE\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u8f6c\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Our key innovation systematically extracts pure content from content images and style elements from style references, ensuring authentic transfers.

However, this paper identifies a paradoxical phenomenon we term the Benefit then Conflict dilemma, where detector performance stagnates and eventually degrades as source diversity expands. Our systematic analysis, diagnoses this failure by identifying two core issues: severe data-level heterogeneity, which causes the feature distributions of real and synthetic images to increasingly overlap, and a critical model-level bottleneck from fixed, pretrained encoders that cannot adapt to the rising complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Generator-Aware Prototype Learning (GAPL), a framework that constrain representation with a structured learning paradigm. GAPL learns a compact set of canonical forgery prototypes to create a unified, low-variance feature space, effectively countering data heterogeneity.To resolve the model bottleneck, it employs a two-stage training scheme with Low-Rank Adaptation, enhancing its discriminative power while preserving valuable pretrained knowledge.

Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eCLIP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u867d\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u5c06CLIP\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u8868\u5f81\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u517c\u987e\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u6574\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4ec5\u951a\u5b9a\u5355\u4e2alogit\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff08\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The framework formalizes the ETL scheduling process as a Markov Decision Process and enables adaptive decision-making by a reinforcement learning agent in high-dimensional state spaces to dynamically optimize task allocation and resource scheduling. The model consists of a state representation module, a feature embedding network, a Q-value estimator, and a reward evaluation mechanism, which collectively consider task dependencies, node load states, and data flow characteristics to derive the optimal scheduling strategy in complex environments. A multi-objective reward function is designed to balance key performance indicators such as average scheduling delay, task completion rate, throughput, and resource utilization. Sensitivity experiments further verify the model's robustness under changes in hyperparameters, environmental dynamics, and data scale. Experimental results show that the proposed deep Q-learning scheduling framework significantly reduces scheduling delay, improves system throughput, and enhances execution stability under multi-source heterogeneous task conditions, demonstrating the strong potential of reinforcement learning in complex data scheduling and resource management, and providing an efficient and scalable optimization strategy for intelligent data pipeline construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u7684ETL\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06ETL\u8c03\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8c03\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0bETL\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06ETL\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u3001Q\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u517c\u987e\u5e73\u5747\u8c03\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8c03\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We present the first systematic study that adapts and compares state-of-the-art distillation techniques on a strong T2I teacher model, FLUX.1-lite. By casting existing methods into a unified framework, we identify the key obstacles that arise when moving from discrete class labels to free-form language prompts.

This limitation motivates the development of multi-fidelity strategies that leverage inexpensive low-fidelity information without compromising accuracy. Addressing this challenge, this work presents a multi-fidelity deep learning framework that combines autoencoder-based transfer learning with a newly developed Multi-Split Conformal Prediction (MSCP) strategy to achieve uncertainty-aware aerodynamic data fusion under extreme data scarcity. The methodology leverages abundant Low-Fidelity (LF) data to learn a compact latent physics representation, which acts as a frozen knowledge base for a decoder that is subsequently fine-tuned using scarce HF samples. Tested on surface-pressure distributions for NACA airfoils (2D) and a transonic wing (3D) databases, the model successfully corrects LF deviations and achieves high-accuracy pressure predictions using minimal HF training data. Furthermore, the MSCP framework produces robust, actionable uncertainty bands with pointwise coverage exceeding 95%. By combining extreme data efficiency with uncertainty quantification, this work offers a scalable and reliable solution for aerodynamic regression in data-scarce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5206\u5272\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08MSCP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6c14\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6c14\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9690\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51bb\u7ed3\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b\u518d\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5206\u5272\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08MSCP\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff08>95%\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728NACA\u7ffc\u578b\uff082D\uff09\u548c\u8de8\u97f3\u901f\u673a\u7ffc\uff083D\uff09\u8868\u9762\u538b\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u6781\u5c11\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6821\u6b63\u4f4e\u4fdd\u771f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5177\u6781\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6c14\u52a8\u56de\u5f52\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Dansereau"], "title": "Light Field Based 6DoF Tracking of Previously Unobserved Objects", "comment": null, "summary": "Object tracking is an important step in robotics and reautonomous driving pipelines, which has to generalize to previously unseen and complex objects. Existing high-performing methods often rely on pre-captured object views to build explicit reference models, which restricts them to a fixed set of known objects. However, such reference models can struggle with visually complex appearance, reducing the quality of tracking. In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers in these difficult cases, paving the way toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.

Existing LLM personalization benchmarks are largely centered on two axes: accurately recalling user information and accurately applying remembered information in downstream tasks. We argue that a third axis, likability, is both subjective and central to user experience, yet under-measured by current benchmarks. To measure likability holistically, we introduce LikeBench, a multi-session, dynamic evaluation framework that measures likability across multiple dimensions by how much an LLM can adapt over time to a user's preferences to provide more likable responses. In LikeBench, the LLMs engage in conversation with a simulated user and learn preferences only from the ongoing dialogue. As the interaction unfolds, models try to adapt to responses, and after each turn, they are evaluated for likability across seven dimensions by the same simulated user. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to decompose likability into multiple diagnostic metrics: emotional adaptation, formality matching, knowledge adaptation, reference understanding, conversation length fit, humor fit, and callback, which makes it easier to pinpoint where a model falls short. To make the simulated user more realistic and discriminative, LikeBench uses fine-grained, psychologically grounded descriptive personas rather than the coarse high/low trait rating based personas used in prior work. Our benchmark shows that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability: DeepSeek R1, with lower memory accuracy (86%, 17 facts/profile), outperformed Qwen3 by 28% on likability score despite Qwen3's higher memory accuracy (93%, 43 facts/profile).

Meanwhile, despite the success of deep learning in medical imaging, the lack of interpretability limits its clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose TWLR, a two-stage framework for interpretable diabetic retinopathy (DR) assessment. In the first stage, a vision-language model integrates domain-specific ophthalmological knowledge into text embeddings to jointly perform DR grading and lesion classification, effectively linking semantic medical concepts with visual features. The second stage introduces an iterative severity regression framework based on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Lesion saliency maps generated through iterative refinement direct a progressive inpainting mechanism that systematically eliminates pathological features, effectively downgrading disease severity toward healthier fundus appearances. Critically, this severity regression approach achieves dual benefits: accurate lesion localization without pixel-level supervision and providing an interpretable visualization of disease-to-healthy transformations.

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%). Notably, when using 4K labeled and 12K unlabeled samples, TraPO even outperforms the fully supervised model trained on the full 45K labeled samples on all benchmarks, while using only 10% of the labeled data.

However, existing methods necessitate to either predict pseudo annotations after image generation or generate images conditioned on manual annotation masks, which incurs image-annotation semantic inconsistency or scalability problem. To migrate both problems with one stone, we present a novel dataset generative diffusion framework for semantic segmentation, termed JoDiffusion. Firstly, given a standard latent diffusion model, JoDiffusion incorporates an independent annotation variational auto-encoder (VAE) network to map annotation masks into the latent space shared by images. Then, the diffusion model is tailored to capture the joint distribution of each image and its annotation mask conditioned on a text prompt.

Bayesian neural networks offer a framework to address these challenges by incorporating uncertainty directly into the model, yielding more reliable predictions, particularly for out-of-distribution data. This paper presents Hierarchical Approximate Bayesian Neural Network, a novel approach that uses a Gaussian-inverse-Wishart distribution as a hyperprior of the network's weights to increase both the robustness and performance of the model. We provide analytical representations for the predictive distribution and weight posterior, which amount to the calculation of the parameters of Student's t-distributions in closed form with linear complexity with respect to the number of weights. Our method demonstrates robust performance, effectively addressing issues of overfitting and providing reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly for out-of-distribution tasks.

To tackle this task, we propose a unified framework combining Qwen-VL for comprehension and LTX for synthesis, bridged by a latent query embedding and a connector module.

We implement a simple and interpretable QuanvNN architecture that can be directly compared to its classical CNN counterpart, and evaluate its performance on a synthetic NMR-inspired dataset.

Focusing on people counting in indoor environments using frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, we systematically investigate a broad set of approaches, including amplitude-based statistical preprocessing (sigmoid weighting and threshold zeroing), frequency-domain filtering, autoencoder-based background suppression, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning. Experimental results collected across two environments with different layouts demonstrate that sigmoid-based amplitude weighting consistently achieves superior cross-environment performance, yielding 50.1% and 55.2% reductions in root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, compared with baseline methods. Data augmentation provides additional though modest benefits, with improvements up to 8.8% in MAE. By contrast, transfer learning proves indispensable for large spatial shifts, achieving 82.1% and 91.3% reductions in RMSE and MAE, respectively, with 540 target-domain samples. Taken together, these findings establish a highly practical direction for developing radar sensing systems capable of maintaining robust accuracy under spatial variations by integrating deep learning models with amplitude-based preprocessing and efficient transfer learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c04\u9891\uff08RF\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u4f7f\u7528FMCW MIMO\u96f7\u8fbe\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba4\u5185\u4eba\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSigmoid\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6cdb\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff08Sigmoid\u52a0\u6743\u3001\u9608\u503c\u7f6e\u96f6\uff09\u3001\u9891\u57df\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80cc\u666f\u6291\u5236\u3001\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "Sigmoid\u5e45\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u4f7fRMSE\u548cMAE\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e50.1%\u548c55.2%\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6700\u591a\u6539\u55848.8% MAE\uff1b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728540\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u4f7fRMSE\u548cMAE\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e82.1%\u548c91.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, transferring knowledge effectively from one graph to another remains a critical challenge. This highlights the need for algorithms capable of applying information extracted from a source graph to an unlabeled target graph, a task known as unsupervised graph domain adaptation (GDA). One key difficulty in unsupervised GDA is conditional shift, which hinders transferability. In this paper, we show that conditional shift can be observed only if there exists local dependencies among node features. To support this claim, we perform a rigorous analysis and also further provide generalization bounds of GDA when dependent node features are modeled using markov chains. Guided by the theoretical findings, we propose to improve GDA by decorrelating node features, which can be specifically implemented through decorrelated GCN layers and graph transformer layers. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing not only substantial performance enhancements over baseline GDA methods but also clear visualizations of small intra-class distances in the learned representations.

We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions.

The technique of n-step returns is known to increase the convergence speed of RL algorithms compared to their 1-step returns-based versions. However, SAC is notoriously difficult to combine with n-step returns, since their usual combination introduces bias in off-policy algorithms due to the changes in action distribution. While this problem is solved by importance sampling, a method for estimating expected values of one distribution using samples from another distribution, importance sampling may result in numerical instability. In this work, we combine SAC with n-step returns in a way that overcomes this issue. We present an approach to applying numerically stable importance sampling with simplified hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, we analyze the entropy estimation approach of Soft Actor-Critic in the context of the n-step maximum entropy framework and formulate the $\u03c4$-sampled entropy estimation to reduce the variance of the learning target. Finally, we formulate the Soft Actor-Critic with n-step returns (SAC$n$) algorithm that we experimentally verify on MuJoCo simulated environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06Soft Actor-Critic\uff08SAC\uff09\u4e0en\u6b65\u56de\u62a5\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SACn\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u03c4-\u91c7\u6837\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfn\u6b65SAC\u4e2d\u56e0\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MuJoCo\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "SAC\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0en\u6b65\u56de\u62a5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5f15\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u800c\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u867d\u53ef\u7ea0\u504f\uff0c\u5374\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u5728n\u6b65\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5206\u6790SAC\u7684\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u03c4-\u91c7\u6837\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u6784\u5efaSACn\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "SACn\u5728MuJoCo\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5c06n\u6b65\u56de\u62a5\u878d\u5165SAC\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf/\u5728\u7ebf\u6700\u5927\u71b5RL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This mismatch between physical reality and digital representation limits the ability of current models to capture polymer behaviour. Here we introduce PolySet, a framework that represents a polymer as a finite, weighted ensemble of chains sampled from an assumed molar-mass distribution. This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model. We show that PolySet retains higher-order distributional moments (such as Mz, Mz+1), enabling ML models to learn tail-sensitive properties with greatly improved stability and accuracy.

We systematically evaluated five approaches in two indoor environments with distinct layouts: a rule-based connected component method; three traditional machine learning models, namely k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine; and a deep learning model combining a convolutional neural network and long short term memory. In the training environment, the convolutional neural network long short term memory model achieved the highest accuracy, while traditional machine learning models provided moderate performance. In a new layout, however, all learning based methods showed significant degradation, whereas the rule-based method remained stable. Notably, for binary detection of presence versus absence of people, all models consistently achieved high accuracy across layouts. These results demonstrate that high capacity models can produce fine grained outputs with high accuracy in the same environment, but they are vulnerable to domain shift. In contrast, rule-based methods cannot provide fine grained outputs but exhibit robustness against domain shift. Moreover, regardless of the model type, a clear trade off was revealed between spatial generalization performance and output granularity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8c03\u9891\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2MIMO\u96f7\u8fbe\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6ce2\u4f20\u611f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5374\u5bf9\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u89c4\u5219\u6cd5\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6ce2\u4f20\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u901a\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001k\u8fd1\u90bb\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u4e09\u79cd\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caCNN-LSTM\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "CNN-LSTM\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u6362\u65b0\u5e03\u5c40\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u5e03\u5c40\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u5b58\u5728/\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5408\u540c\u57df\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\u4f46\u8f93\u51fa\u7c97\u7cd9\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u786e\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

We address vessel destination estimation using global-scope AIS data by proposing a differentiated approach that recasts long port-to-port trajectories as a nested sequence structure. Using spatial grids, this method mitigates spatio-temporal bias while preserving detailed resolution. We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, WAY, designed to process these reformulated trajectories for long-term destination estimation days to weeks in advance. WAY comprises a trajectory representation layer and Channel-Aggregative Sequential Processing (CASP) blocks. The representation layer generates multi-channel vector sequences from kinematic and non-kinematic features. CASP blocks utilize multi-headed channel- and self-attention for aggregation and sequential information delivery. Additionally, we propose a task-specialized Gradient Dropout (GD) technique to enable many-to-many training on single labels, preventing biased feedback surges by stochastically blocking gradient flow based on sample length. Experiments on 5-year AIS data demonstrate WAY's superiority over conventional spatial grid-based approaches regardless of trajectory progression. Results further confirm that adopting GD leads to performance gains. Finally, we explore WAY's potential for real-world application through multitask learning for ETA estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aWAY\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u7403AIS\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u671f\u8239\u8236\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u4e22\u5f03\uff08GD\uff09\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u5bf9\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "AIS\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u8239\u8236\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6e2f-\u6e2f\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5957\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u7f13\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1WAY\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u548c\u901a\u9053\u805a\u5408\u987a\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\uff08CASP\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e22\u5f03\uff08GD\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6807\u7b7e\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u5e74AIS\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWAY\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14GD\u6280\u672f\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728ETA\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "WAY\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u5176GD\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8239\u8236\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u6d77\u4e8b\u76d1\u63a7\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process.

Yet, conventional FL aggregation remains susceptible to noise, latency, and security constraints inherent to real-time vehicular networks. This paper introduces Noise-Resilient Quantum Federated Learning (NR-QFL), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that enables secure, low-latency aggregation through variational quantum circuits (VQCs) operating under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) conditions. The framework encodes model parameters as quantum states with adaptive gate reparameterization, ensuring bounded-error convergence and provable resilience under Completely Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics.

Recent methods densify the reward by querying a teacher that provides step-level feedback, e.g., Guided Thought Reinforcement (GTR) and On-Policy Distillation, but rely on costly, often privileged models as the teacher, limiting practicality and reproducibility. We introduce GTR-Turbo, a highly efficient upgrade to GTR, which matches the performance without training or querying an expensive teacher model. Specifically, GTR-Turbo merges the weights of checkpoints produced during the ongoing RL training, and then uses this merged model as a \"free\" teacher to guide the subsequent RL via supervised fine-tuning or soft logit distillation. This design removes dependence on privileged VLMs (e.g., GPT or Gemini), mitigates the \"entropy collapse\" observed in prior work, and keeps training stable.

Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown promise across heterogeneous regions, its distributed nature introduces new vulnerabilities. In particular, data poisoning attacks, in which compromised clients inject manipulated training data, can degrade performance or introduce systematic biases. These threats are amplified by spatial dependencies in meteorological data, allowing localized perturbations to influence broader regions through global model aggregation. In this study, we investigate how adversarial clients distort federated surface temperature forecasts trained on the Copernicus European Regional ReAnalysis (CERRA) dataset. We simulate geographically distributed clients and evaluate patch-based and global biasing attacks on regional temperature forecasts. Our results show that even a small fraction of poisoned clients can mislead predictions across large, spatially connected areas. A global temperature bias attack from a single compromised client shifts predictions by up to -1.7 K, while coordinated patch attacks more than triple the mean squared error and produce persistent regional anomalies exceeding +3.5 K. Finally, we assess trimmed mean aggregation as a defense mechanism, showing that it successfully defends against global bias attacks (2-13\\% degradation) but fails against patch attacks (281-603\\% amplification), exposing limitations of outlier-based defenses for spatially correlated data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eCERRA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u9762\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5982\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u622a\u65ad\u5747\u503c\u805a\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7279\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5728CERRA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u8865\u4e01\u5f0f\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u5dee\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u622a\u65ad\u5747\u503c\u805a\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u9632\u5fa1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5c11\u91cf\u4e2d\u6bd2\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u8bef\u5bfc\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u6e29\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u5355\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u5dee\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4-1.7 K\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u534f\u540c\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u4f7f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u589e\u81f3\u4e09\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f+3.5 K\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u533a\u57df\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b\u622a\u65ad\u5747\u503c\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5168\u5c40\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d2\u201313%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u52a0\u5267\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927281\u2013603%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u5254\u9664\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, their substantial computational cost makes deployment on resource-constrained devices impractical. In this paper, we introduce an efficient asymmetric VPR framework that incorporates a high-capacity gallery model for offline feature extraction with a lightweight query network for online processing. A key challenge in this setting is ensuring compatibility between these heterogeneous networks, which conventional approaches address through computationally expensive k-NN-based compatible training. To overcome this, we propose a geographical memory bank that structures gallery features using geolocation metadata inherent in VPR databases, eliminating the need for exhaustive k-NN computations. Additionally, we introduce an implicit embedding augmentation technique that enhances the query network to model feature variations despite its limited capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces computational costs but also outperforms existing asymmetric retrieval techniques, establishing a new aspect for VPR in resource-limited environments.

However, they confront a core dilemma: how to preserve fine-grained intra-modality features while bridging the significant domain gap across different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework. Leveraging our 18-million multimodal and comprehensive medical retrieval database derived from PubMed scientific papers, we pioneer the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into CL. Specifically, we employ a multi-modal, multi-layer RAG system that provides real-time guidance for model fine-tuning through dynamic, on-demand knowledge retrieval. Building upon this, we introduce a dynamic knowledge distillation framework. This framework precisely resolves the aforementioned core dilemma by dynamically modulating the importance of the parameter space, the granularity of the distilled knowledge, and the data distribution of the reference dataset in accordance with the required level of detail. To thoroughly validate the clinical value of our strategy, we have designed a more rigorous \\textbf{M}edical Generalist Task Incremental Learning (MGTIL) benchmark. This benchmark is engineered to simultaneously evaluate the model's capacity for adaptation to significant domain shifts, retention of subtle intra-domain features, and real-time learning of novel and complex medical tasks.

Our study focuses on masked feature reconstruction (MFR), a generative technique where a model learns to restore the raw features of masked nodes in a self-supervised manner. We observe that both MFR and graph contrastive learning (GCL) aim to maximize agreement between similar elements. Building on this observation, we reveal a novel theoretical insight: under specific conditions, the objectives of MFR and node-level GCL converge, despite their distinct operational mechanisms. This theoretical connection suggests these approaches are complementary rather than fundamentally different, prompting us to explore their integration to enhance self-supervised learning on graphs. Our research presents Contrastive Masked Feature Reconstruction (CORE), a novel graph self-supervised learning framework that integrates contrastive learning into MFR. Specifically, we form positive pairs exclusively between the original and reconstructed features of masked nodes, encouraging the encoder to prioritize contextual information over the node's own features.

Recent lightweight training approaches have shown promise by learning optimal timesteps, but their scope remains restricted to ODE discretizations. To broaden this scope, we propose learning the optimal transformation of the sampling trajectory by parameterizing stochastic interpolant (SI) schedulers. The main challenge lies in designing a parameterization that satisfies critical desiderata, including boundary conditions, differentiability, and monotonicity of the SNR. To effectively meet these requirements, we represent scheduler functions as B\u00e9zier functions, where control points naturally enforce these properties.

Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD.

However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates.

Through complementary privacy mechanisms: DP-SGD with adaptive clipping and Lipschitz regularized VAE decoders and a stateful architecture supporting heterogeneous clients, we experimentally validate our approach on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets with cross-domain outliers. Our analysis demonstrates that both privacy mechanisms effectively map sensitive outliers to typical data points while maintaining utility in extreme Non-IID scenarios typical of cross-silo collaborations.\n  Index Terms: Client-invariant Learning, Federated Learning (FL), Privacy-preserving Generative Models, Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID), Heterogeneous Architectures", "AI": {"tldr": "ALIGN-FL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5171\u4eab\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08Non-IID\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1SGD\u4e0eLipschitz\u6b63\u5219\u5316VAE\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u5f02\u6784\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u3001\u542b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684Non-IID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u5b58\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faALIGN-FL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4ec5\u4e0a\u4f20\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982VAE\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5f15\u5165DP-SGD\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526a\u548cLipschitz\u6b63\u5219\u5316VAE\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u548cFashion-MNIST\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8de8\u57df\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u654f\u611f\u5f02\u5e38\u70b9\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u5178\u578b\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6781\u7aefNon-IID\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "ALIGN-FL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u5f02\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u673a\u6784\uff08cross-silo\uff09\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, they often struggle to generalize to specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations, due to a mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aUnCoL\u7684\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u51bb\u7ed3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u7279\u5316\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u7076\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u867d\u5177\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u75c5\u7406\u53d8\u5f02\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08UnCoL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6559\u5e08\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5316\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7531\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd2D/3D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cUnCoL\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UnCoL\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To confirm its generality for various dynamics and dimensionalities, the framework is evaluated on a representative set of partial differential equations (PDEs). In all tested cases, the student model preserved the teacher's physical accuracy, with a mean RMSE increase below 0.64%, and achieved inference speedups ranging from 4.8x (Navier-Stokes) to 6.9x (Burgers).

As large language models (LLMs) become widely used, managing risks arising from insufficient forgetting or utility loss is increasingly crucial. Current MU techniques lack effective mechanisms for evaluating and controlling these risks, hindering the selection of strategies that appropriately balance safety and utility, and raising trust concerns surrounding the \"right to be forgotten.\" To address these issues, we propose FROC, a unified framework with Risk-Optimized Control for machine unlearning in LLMs. FROC is built around a conformal-style risk-control formulation that expresses a user-specified risk budget on unlearning behavior. This probability-based constraint enables FROC to compare MU strategies, identify feasible operating regions, and guide hyperparameter selection according to desired trade-offs between forgetting sufficiency and utility preservation. To operationalize this constraint, FROC introduces a smoothly varying continuous risk model that aggregates forgetting deficiency and utility degradation into a single configuration-level score. Building on conformal risk analysis, FROC computes (1) the Conformal Unlearning Risk (CUR), a data-driven estimated value on the probability that forgotten samples continue to influence model predictions, and (2) risk-controlled configuration sets, which identify unlearning hyperparameters that are valid under the specified risk budget. Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact. FROC reframes MU as a controllable, risk-aware process and offers a practical foundation for managing unlearning behavior in large-scale LLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FROC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u98ce\u9669\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u5145\u5206\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u5f62\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6FROC\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u5171\u5f62\u9057\u5fd8\u98ce\u9669\uff08CUR\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u6ee1\u8db3\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFROC\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u56fe\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u9057\u5fd8\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79fb\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "FROC\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u884c\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, the inference accuracy deteriorates due to the non-stationarity in the IoT environment and limited initial training data. To counteract this, the deployed models can be updated occasionally with new observed data samples. However, this approach consumes additional energy, which is undesirable for energy constrained IoT devices. This letter introduces an event-driven communication framework that strategically integrates continual learning (CL) in IoT networks for energy-efficient fault detection. Our framework enables the IoT device and the edge server (ES) to collaboratively update the lightweight ML model by adapting to the wireless link conditions for communication and the available energy budget. Evaluation on real-world datasets show that the proposed approach can outperform both periodic sampling and non-adaptive CL in terms of inference recall; our proposed approach achieves up to a 42.8% improvement, even under tight energy and bandwidth constraint.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u4e0e\u7269\u8054\u7f51\uff08IoT\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u9891\u7e41\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u53c8\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7fIoT\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u534f\u540c\u66f4\u65b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7ML\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u65e0\u7ebf\u94fe\u8def\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5468\u671f\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534742.8%\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e25\u82db\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u5e26\u5bbd\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650IoT\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Additionally, recent advances have successfully enabled efficient 3D reconstruction from large-scale, unposed image collections, underscoring opportunities for unified approaches to dynamic scene understanding. Motivated by this, we propose DePT3R, a novel framework that simultaneously performs dense point tracking and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple images in a single forward pass. This multi-task learning is achieved by extracting deep spatio-temporal features with a powerful backbone and regressing pixel-wise maps with dense prediction heads. Crucially, DePT3R operates without requiring camera poses, substantially enhancing its adaptability and efficiency-especially important in dynamic environments with rapid changes. We validate DePT3R on several challenging benchmarks involving dynamic scenes, demonstrating strong performance and significant improvements in memory efficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping.

However, high computational demands, complex incentive mechanisms, and disparities in client-side computing power often lead to long times and higher costs. To address these challenges, many existing methods rely on server-side knowledge distillation that solely removes the updates of the target client, overlooking the privacy embedded in the contributions of other clients, which can lead to privacy leakage. In this work, we introduce DPUL, a novel server-side unlearning method that deeply unlearns all influential weights to prevent privacy pitfalls. Our approach comprises three components: (i) identifying high-weight parameters by filtering client update magnitudes, and rolling them back to ensure deep removal. (ii) leveraging the variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and eliminate low-weight parameters. (iii) utilizing a projection-based technique to recover the model.

Unsupervised depth completion methods have been proposed for various datasets where ground truth depth data is unavailable and supervised methods cannot be applied. However, these models require auxiliary data to estimate depth values, which is far from real scenarios. Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models can produce a plausible relative depth map from a single image, but there is no work to properly combine the sparse depth map with MDE for depth completion; a simple affine transformation to the depth map will yield a high error since MDE are inaccurate at estimating depth difference between objects. We introduce StarryGazer, a domain-agnostic framework that predicts dense depth images from a single sparse depth image and an RGB image without relying on ground-truth depth by leveraging the power of large MDE models. First, we employ a pre-trained MDE model to produce relative depth images.

Material reconstruction is highly underconstrained and typically relies on analysis-by-synthesis, which requires expensive and noisy path tracing. To better constrain the optimization, we incorporate single-view priors into the reconstruction process. We leverage a diffusion-based material estimator that produces multiple, but often inconsistent, candidate decompositions per view. To reduce the inconsistency, we fit an explicit low-dimensional parametric function to the predictions. We then propose a robust optimization framework using soft per-view prediction selection together with confidence-based soft multi-view inlier set to fuse the most consistent predictions of the most confident views into a consistent parametric material space. Finally, we use inverse path tracing to optimize for the low-dimensional parameters.

Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.

Generative models offer a potential solution but suffer from semantic instability and morphological hallucinations that compromise diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Correlation-Regulated Alignment Framework for Tissue Synthesis (CRAFTS), the first generative foundation model for pathology-specific text-to-image synthesis. By leveraging a dual-stage training strategy on approximately 2.8 million image-caption pairs, CRAFTS incorporates a novel alignment mechanism that suppresses semantic drift to ensure biological accuracy. This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering. In addition, coupling CRAFTS with ControlNet enables precise control over tissue architecture from inputs such as nuclear segmentation masks and fluorescence images.

However, existing data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) methods-primarily designed for classification-often disregard this continuity, resulting in significant performance degradation when applied directly to segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce DFSS, a novel data-free distillation framework tailored for semantic segmentation. Unlike prior approaches that treat pixels independently, DFSS respects the structural and contextual continuity of real-world scenes. Our key insight is to leverage Batch Normalization (BN) statistics from a teacher model to guide Approximate Distribution Sampling (ADS), enabling the selection of data that better reflects the original training distribution-without relying on potentially misleading teacher predictions. Additionally, we propose Weighted Distribution Progressive Distillation (WDPD), which dynamically prioritizes reliable samples that are more closely aligned with the original data distribution early in training and gradually incorporates more challenging cases, mirroring the natural progression of learning in human perception. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that DFSS consistently outperforms existing data-free distillation methods for semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced reliance on auxiliary data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDFSS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684BN\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u6307\u5bfc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\uff08ADS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a0\u6743\u5206\u5e03\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u84b8\u998f\uff08WDPD\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6240\u9700\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDFSS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578bBN\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5206\u5e03\u91c7\u6837\uff08ADS\uff09\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a0\u6743\u5206\u5e03\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u84b8\u998f\uff08WDPD\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u4f18\u5148\u84b8\u998f\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cDFSS\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0a\u91cd\u573a\u666f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1bDFSS\u901a\u8fc7BN\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u52a0\u6743\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Finally, both anomalous and normal training data are often scarce, particularly for newly introduced product variations. We investigate on-device continual learning for unsupervised VAD with localization, extending the PatchCore to incorporate online learning for real-world industrial scenarios. The proposed method leverages a lightweight feature extractor and an incremental coreset update mechanism based on k-center selection, enabling rapid, memory-efficient adaptation from limited data while eliminating costly cloud retraining. Evaluations on an industrial use case are conducted using a testbed designed to emulate flexible production with frequent variant changes in a controlled environment.

Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have achieved communication efficiency and high performance via intermediate fusion. However, they share a critical vulnerability: their performance degrades under adverse communication conditions due to the misalignment induced by data transmission, which severely hampers their practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA. Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves upon its baseline performance by approximately 19% in AP@0.7 with more than 5x less communication volume, which makes it a promising solution for robust collaborative perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoRA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7ea7\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u89e3\u8026\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u826f\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoRA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u5206\u652f\uff08\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u5408\uff09\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7ea7\u6821\u6b63\u5206\u652f\uff08\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6821\u6b63\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u79fb\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cCoRA\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728AP@0.7\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u7ea619%\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u51cf\u5c115\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "CoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8865\u878d\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u662f\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce a new statistical primitive, the reproducibility budget $C_T$, which quantifies a system's finite capacity for statistical reproducibility - the extent to which its sampling process can remain governed by a consistent underlying distribution in the presence of both exogenous change and endogenous feedback. Formally, $C_T$ is defined as the cumulative Fisher-Rao path length of the coupled learner-environment evolution, measuring the total distributional motion accumulated during learning. From this construct we derive a drift-feedback generalization bound of order $O(T^{-1/2} + C_T/T)$, and we prove a matching minimax lower bound showing that this rate is minimax-optimal. Consequently, the results establish a reproducibility speed limit: no algorithm can achieve smaller worst-case generalization error than that imposed by the average Fisher-Rao drift rate $C_T/T$ of the data-generating process.

However, progress remains constrained by the limited availability of large-scale, physically consistent illumination data. To address this, we introduce POLAR, a large-scale and physically calibrated One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) dataset containing over 200 subjects captured under 156 lighting directions, multiple views, and diverse expressions. Building upon POLAR, we develop a flow-based generative model POLARNet that predicts per-light OLAT responses from a single portrait, capturing fine-grained and direction-aware illumination effects while preserving facial identity. Unlike diffusion or background-conditioned methods that rely on statistical or contextual cues, our formulation models illumination as a continuous, physically interpretable transformation between lighting states, enabling scalable and controllable relighting. Together, POLAR and POLARNet form a unified illumination learning framework that links real data, generative synthesis, and physically grounded relighting, establishing a self-sustaining \"chicken-and-egg\" cycle for scalable and reproducible portrait illumination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86POLAR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cPOLARNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u8138\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7167\u660e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7269\u7406\u6821\u51c6\u7684OLAT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5355\u5f20\u4eba\u50cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u5411\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u8138\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4efb\u52a1\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7167\u660e\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u771f\u5b9e\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b200\u591a\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u3001156\u4e2a\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u6821\u51c6OLAT\u6570\u636e\u96c6POLAR\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\uff08flow-based\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578bPOLARNet\uff0c\u5c06\u5149\u7167\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u4eba\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5404\u65b9\u5411OLAT\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "POLARNet\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5149\u7167\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u91cd\u5149\u7167\uff1bPOLAR\u4e0ePOLARNet\u5171\u540c\u6784\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7167\u660e\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684 Portrait Illumination \u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "POLAR\u548cPOLARNet\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u8138\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u5411\u66f4\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Such agents could intentionally sabotage these codebases if they were misaligned. We investigate asynchronous monitoring, in which a monitoring system reviews agent actions after the fact. Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents). We attempt to set the game rules such that they upper bound the sabotage potential of an agent based on Claude 4.1 Opus. To ground this game in a realistic, high-stakes deployment scenario, we develop a suite of 5 diverse software engineering environments that simulate tasks that an agent might perform within an AI developer's internal infrastructure. Over the course of the game, we develop an ensemble monitor that achieves a 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate on a held out test environment. Then, we estimate risk of sabotage at deployment time by extrapolating from our monitor's false negative rate. We describe one simple model for this extrapolation, present a sensitivity analysis, and describe situations in which the model would be invalid.

This challenges interpretability, yet we lack principled methods to measure superposition. We present an information-theoretic framework measuring a neural representation's effective degrees of freedom. We apply Shannon entropy to sparse autoencoder activations to compute the number of effective features as the minimum neurons needed for interference-free encoding. Equivalently, this measures how many \"virtual neurons\" the network simulates through superposition. When networks encode more effective features than actual neurons, they must accept interference as the price of compression. Our metric strongly correlates with ground truth in toy models, detects minimal superposition in algorithmic tasks, and reveals systematic reduction under dropout. Layer-wise patterns mirror intrinsic dimensionality studies on Pythia-70M. The metric also captures developmental dynamics, detecting sharp feature consolidation during grokking. Surprisingly, adversarial training can increase effective features while improving robustness, contradicting the hypothesis that superposition causes vulnerability. Instead, the effect depends on task complexity and network capacity: simple tasks with ample capacity allow feature expansion (abundance regime), while complex tasks or limited capacity force reduction (scarcity regime). By defining superposition as lossy compression, this work enables principled measurement of how neural networks organize information under computational constraints, connecting superposition to adversarial robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u91cf\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684'\u6709\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u6570'\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5ea6\u91cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\uff08superposition\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u53e0\u52a0\uff08\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u4eab\u540c\u4e00\u7ec4\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u65b9\u5411\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53e0\u52a0\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u2018\u6709\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u2019\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5e72\u6270\u7f16\u7801\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c11\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6570\uff0c\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u53e0\u52a0\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u2018\u865a\u62df\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u2019\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u5728\u73a9\u5177\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0dropout\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u53e0\u52a0\uff0c\u5c42\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0ePythia-70M\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u7ef4\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6355\u6349grokking\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u56fa\u5316\uff1b\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u5e94\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb9\u91cf\uff08\u4e30\u88d5/\u7a00\u7f3a\u673a\u5236\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u53e0\u52a0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5982\u4f55\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acb\u8d77\u53e0\u52a0\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86STARCaster\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8eab\u4efd\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u8096\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8096\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f6f\u8eab\u4efd\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u6027\u9690\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b03D\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67092D\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff1b3D\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u753b\u5219\u5e38\u56e0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "STARCaster\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u8eab\u4efd\u611f\u77e5\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5507\u8bfb\u76d1\u7763\u5b9e\u73b0\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u5e8f\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u9002\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u52a8\u753b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u5f3a\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "STARCaster\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8de8\u8eab\u4efd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u52a8\u753b\u9759\u6001\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "STARCaster\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u57282D\u89c6\u9891\u57df\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In contrast, embodied agents require ambulatory vision, actively moving to obtain more informative views. We introduce Visually Grounded Active View Selection (VG-AVS), a task that selects the most informative next viewpoint using only the visual information in the current image, without relying on scene memory or external knowledge. To support this task, we construct a synthetic dataset with automatically generated paired query-target views and question-answer prompts.

To address this, we introduce Diffusion Preview, a novel paradigm employing rapid, low-step sampling to generate preliminary outputs for user evaluation, deferring full-step refinement until the preview is deemed satisfactory. Existing acceleration methods, including training-free solvers and post-training distillation, struggle to deliver high-quality previews or ensure consistency between previews and final outputs. We propose ConsistencySolver derived from general linear multistep methods, a lightweight, trainable high-order solver optimized via Reinforcement Learning, that enhances preview quality and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that ConsistencySolver significantly improves generation quality and consistency in low-step scenarios, making it ideal for efficient preview-and-refine workflows. Notably, it achieves FID scores on-par with Multistep DPM-Solver using 47% fewer steps, while outperforming distillation baselines.

However, these techniques face scalability challenges for high-dimensional systems, as they rely on state-space discretization which grows exponentially with dimension. Learning-based approaches to dimensionality reduction, utilizing neural networks and autoencoders, have shown great potential to alleviate this problem. However, ensuring the correctness of the resulting verification results remains an open question. In this work, we provide a formal approach to reduce the dimensionality of systems via convex autoencoders and learn the dynamics in the latent space through a kernel-based method.

We show that the verification results in the latent space can be mapped back to the original system.

Prior AIGC detection benchmarks mostly evaluate video without audio, target broad narrative domains, and focus on classification solely. Yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art video generation models can produce immersive, audio-paired videos that reliably deceive humans and VLMs. To this end, we introduce Video Reality Test, an ASMR-sourced video benchmark suite for testing perceptual realism under tight audio-visual coupling, featuring the following dimensions: \\textbf{(i) Immersive ASMR video-audio sources.} Built on carefully curated real ASMR videos, the benchmark targets fine-grained action-object interactions with diversity across objects, actions, and backgrounds. \\textbf{(ii) Peer-Review evaluation.} An adversarial creator-reviewer protocol where video generation models act as creators aiming to fool reviewers, while VLMs serve as reviewers seeking to identify fakeness. Our experimental findings show: The best creator Veo3.1-Fast even fools most VLMs: the strongest reviewer (Gemini 2.5-Pro) achieves only 56\\% accuracy (random 50\\%), far below that of human experts (81.25\\%). Adding audio improves real-fake discrimination, yet superficial cues such as watermarks can still significantly mislead models. These findings delineate the current boundary of video generation realism and expose limitations of VLMs in perceptual fidelity and audio-visual consistency.

However, existing methods, including those leveraging pre-trained vision-language models, often produce highly entangled representations, mixing task-relevant forensic cues (causal features) with spurious or irrelevant patterns (non-causal features), thus limiting generalization. To address this issue, we propose CausalCLIP, a framework that explicitly disentangles causal from non-causal features and employs targeted filtering guided by causal inference principles to retain only the most transferable and discriminative forensic cues. By modeling the generation process with a structural causal model and enforcing statistical independence through Gumbel-Softmax-based feature masking and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) constraints, CausalCLIP isolates stable causal features robust to distribution shifts. When tested on unseen generative models from different series, CausalCLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability, achieving improvements of 6.83% in accuracy and 4.06% in average precision over state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCausalCLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6df7\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u975e\u56e0\u679c\uff08\u865a\u5047\u6216\u65e0\u5173\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u523b\u753b\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Gumbel-Softmax\u7279\u5f81\u63a9\u7801\u4e0eHSIC\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c/\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u7559\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6cd5\u8bc1\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u7cfb\u5217\u672a\u89c1\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCausalCLIP\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53476.83%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u53474.06%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u53d6\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing parametric models struggle to distinguish complex, simultaneous disfluencies (e.g., a 'block' with a 'prolongation') due to the scarcity of these specific combinations in training data. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has revolutionized NLP by grounding models in external knowledge, this paradigm remains unexplored in pathological speech processing. To bridge this gap, we introduce StutterFuse, the first Retrieval-Augmented Classifier (RAC) for multi-label stuttering detection. By conditioning a Conformer encoder on a non-parametric memory bank of clinical examples, we allow the model to classify by reference rather than memorization. We further identify and solve \"Modality Collapse\", an \"Echo Chamber\" effect where naive retrieval boosts recall but degrades precision. We mitigate this using: (1) SetCon, a Jaccard-Weighted Metric Learning objective that optimizes for multi-label set similarity, and (2) a Gated Mixture-of-Experts fusion strategy that dynamically arbitrates between acoustic evidence and retrieved context.

However, they still struggle with (1) physical alignment and (2) out-of-distribution (OOD) instruction following. We argue that these issues stem from the models' failure to learn causal directions and to disentangle causal factors for novel recombination. We introduce the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and the Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset to enable diagnostic interventions. This analysis yields three key insights. First, DMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning for elements not explicitly determined in the prompt. Second, the prompt embedding contains disentangled representations for texture and physics. Third, visual causal structure is disproportionately established during the initial, computationally limited denoising steps. Based on these findings, we introduce LINA (Learning INterventions Adaptively), a novel framework that learns to predict prompt-specific interventions, which employs (1) targeted guidance in the prompt and visual latent spaces, and (2) a reallocated, causality-aware denoising schedule. Our approach enforces both physical alignment and OOD instruction following in image and video DMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging causal generation tasks and the Winoground dataset.

Despite the global importance of mango (Mangifera indica L.), there is a lack of studies on the robustness of models for the diagnosis of disease in its leaves. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under adverse conditions. We adapted the MangoLeafDB dataset, generating MangoLeafDB-C with 19 types of artificial corruptions at five severity levels. We conducted a benchmark comparing five architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, Xception, and LCNN (the latter being a lightweight architecture designed specifically for mango leaf diagnosis). The metrics include the F1 score, the corruption error (CE) and the relative mean corruption error (relative mCE). The results show that LCNN outperformed complex models in corruptions that can be present in real-world scenarios such as Defocus Blur, Motion Blur, while also achieving the lowest mCE. Modern architectures (e.g., ResNet-101) exhibited significant performance degradation in corrupted scenarios, despite their high accuracy under ideal conditions. These findings suggest that lightweight and specialized models may be more suitable for real-world applications in edge devices, where robustness and efficiency are critical.

To address this challenge, we propose ShowTable, a pipeline that synergizes MLLMs with diffusion models via a progressive self-correcting process. The MLLM acts as the central orchestrator for reasoning the visual plan and judging visual errors to provide refined instructions, the diffusion execute the commands from MLLM, achieving high-fidelity results. To support this task and our pipeline, we introduce three automated data construction pipelines for training different modules. Furthermore, we introduce TableVisBench, a new benchmark with 800 challenging instances across 5 evaluation dimensions, to assess performance on this task.

A key challenge, however, is bridging the gap between computational route design and practical laboratory execution, particularly the accurate prediction of viable experimental procedures for each synthesis step. In this work, we present QFANG, a scientific reasoning language model capable of generating precise, structured experimental procedures directly from reaction equations, with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning. To develop QFANG, we curated a high-quality dataset comprising 905,990 chemical reactions paired with structured action sequences, extracted and processed from patent literature using large language models. We introduce a Chemistry-Guided Reasoning (CGR) framework that produces chain-of-thought data grounded in chemical knowledge at scale. The model subsequently undergoes supervised fine-tuning to elicit complex chemistry reasoning. Finally, we apply Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further enhance procedural accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that QFANG outperforms advanced general-purpose reasoning models and nearest-neighbor retrieval baselines, measured by traditional NLP similarity metrics and a chemically aware evaluator using an LLM-as-a-judge. Moreover, QFANG generalizes to certain out-of-domain reaction classes and adapts to variations in laboratory conditions and user-specific constraints. We believe that QFANG's ability to generate high-quality synthesis procedures represents an important step toward bridging the gap between computational synthesis planning and fully automated laboratory synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86QFANG\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5316\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8854\u63a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\uff08CASP\uff09\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5404\u5408\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e13\u5229\u53cd\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0890.6\u4e07\u6761\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5316\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\uff08CGR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u5316\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLVR\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3QFANG\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "QFANG\u5728NLP\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u611f\u77e5LLM\u88c1\u5224\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u53cd\u5e94\u7c7b\u522b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "QFANG\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u662f\u8fde\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, prior work exhibits limited efficiency in generating long-duration high-resolution videos, suffering from temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following as video length increases. To address these challenges, we propose KlingAvatar 2.0, a spatio-temporal cascade framework that performs upscaling in both spatial resolution and temporal dimension. The framework first generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes that capture global semantics and motion, and then refines them into high-resolution, temporally coherent sub-clips using a first-last frame strategy, while retaining smooth temporal transitions in long-form videos. To enhance cross-modal instruction fusion and alignment in extended videos, we introduce a Co-Reasoning Director composed of three modality-specific large language model (LLM) experts.

We trace these failures to embedding norm inflation: learned tokens drift to out-of-distribution magnitudes, degrading prompt conditioning in pre-norm Transformers. Empirically, we show semantics are primarily encoded by direction in CLIP token space, while inflated norms harm contextualization; theoretically, we analyze how large magnitudes attenuate positional information and hinder residual updates in pre-norm blocks. We propose Directional Textual Inversion (DTI), which fixes the embedding magnitude to an in-distribution scale and optimizes only direction on the unit hypersphere via Riemannian SGD. We cast direction learning as MAP with a von Mises-Fisher prior, yielding a constant-direction prior gradient that is simple and efficient to incorporate. Across personalization tasks, DTI improves text fidelity over TI and TI-variants while maintaining subject similarity. Crucially, DTI's hyperspherical parameterization enables smooth, semantically coherent interpolation between learned concepts (slerp), a capability that is absent in standard TI.

However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach.

However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.\n  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class.

While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been extensively researched for this problem, current methods frequently struggle with generalization, particularly in data-constrained or challenging settings. Moreover, many existing polyp segmentation methods rely on complex, task-specific architectures. To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention \"key\" features for robust segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that extract tokens from the deepest layers of the Vision Transformer (ViT), our approach leverages the key features of the self-attention module with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalizability. We validate our approach using a multi-center dataset under two rigorous protocols: Domain Generalization (DG) and Extreme Single Domain Generalization (ESDG). Our results, supported by a comprehensive statistical analysis, demonstrate that this pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly enhancing generalization, particularly in data-scarce and challenging scenarios. While avoiding a polyp-specific architecture, we surpass well-established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net.

Mitra"], "title": "Beyond the Visible: Disocclusion-Aware Editing via Proxy Dynamic Graphs", "comment": null, "summary": "We address image-to-video generation with explicit user control over the final frame's disoccluded regions. Current image-to-video pipelines produce plausible motion but struggle to generate predictable, articulated motions while enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed areas. Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables.

Fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be directly re-purposed as an effective refinement mechanism, using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $\u03b2_0$ errors by 60% and $\u03b2_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively.

Current systems based on intraoperative radiographic imaging and bone-anchored markers are invasive, radiation-intensive and workflow disruptive. Recent markerless RGB-D registration methods offer a promising alternative, but existing approaches rely on weak segmentation labels to isolate relevant anatomical structures, which can propagate errors throughout registration. Methods: We present End2Reg an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly optimizes segmentation and registration, eliminating the need for weak segmentation labels and manual steps. The network learns segmentation masks specifically optimized for registration, guided solely by the registration objective without direct segmentation supervision. Results: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ex- and in-vivo benchmarks, reducing median Target Registration Error by 32% to 1.83mm and mean Root Mean Square Error by 45% to 3.95mm, respectively. An ablation study confirms that end-to-end optimization significantly improves registration accuracy.

Existing frameworks often rely on CNN-based spatial backbones combined with temporal convolution or recurrent modules. These techniques fail in capturing fine-grained hand and facial cues and modeling long-range temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal Modeling (USTM) framework, a spatio-temporal encoder that effectively models complex patterns using a combination of a Swin Transformer backbone enhanced with lightweight temporal adapter with positional embeddings (TAPE). Our framework captures fine-grained spatial features alongside short and long-term temporal context, enabling robust sign language recognition from RGB videos without relying on multi-stream inputs or auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments on benchmarked datasets including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily demonstrate that USTM achieves state-of-the-art performance against RGB-based as well as multi-modal CSLR approaches, while maintaining competitive performance against multi-stream approaches. These results highlight the strength and efficacy of the USTM framework for CSLR.

The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure. Furthermore, as the latent dimensionality increases, we observe consistent improvements.

When faced with these ambiguities, TTI models have been shown to exhibit biases in their interpretations. These biases can have societal impacts, e.g., when showing only a certain race for a stated occupation. They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt. Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases. This optimization process is driven by a novel bias score, which ranks biases according to their severity, as we validate on a dataset with known biases. For a given prompt, this score is obtained by comparing the distribution of generated images to the distribution of LLM-generated texts that constitute variations on the prompt.

To address these challenges we present a few-shot learning approach within a lightweight yet efficient framework that combines domain-adapted MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models as feature extractors, along with a feature fusion technique to generate robust feature representation. For the classification task, the fused features are passed through a Bi-LSTM classifier enhanced with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and focus on the most relevant features, thereby achieving optimal classification performance even in complex, real-world environments with noisy or cluttered backgrounds. The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly. Under real-world conditions using field images from the Dhan Shomadhan dataset, it maintained robust performance, reaching 69.28+-1.49% at 15-shot and demonstrating strong resilience to complex backgrounds.

IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells.

It enables precise control over subject motion and has important applications in animation. However, current pose-guided video generation methods are limited to accepting only human poses as input, thus generalizing poorly to pose of other subjects. To address this issue, we propose PoseAnything, the first universal pose-guided video generation framework capable of handling both human and non-human characters, supporting arbitrary skeletal inputs. To enhance consistency preservation during motion, we introduce Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module, which divides the subject into different parts, establishes part correspondences, and computes cross-attention between corresponding parts across frames to achieve fine-grained part-level consistency. Additionally, we propose Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG, a novel guidance strategy that, for the first time, enables independent camera movement control in pose-guided video generation, by separately injecting subject and camera motion control information into the positive and negative anchors of CFG. Furthermore, we present XPose, a high-quality public dataset containing 50,000 non-human pose-video pairs, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering.

Specifically, $\\textbf{T3-Video}$ introduces a multi-scale weight-sharing window attention mechanism and, via hierarchical blocking together with an axis-preserving full-attention design, can effect an \"attention pattern\" transformation of a pretrained model using only modest compute and data. Results on 4K-VBench show that $\\textbf{T3-Video}$ substantially outperforms existing approaches: while delivering performance improvements (+4.29$\\uparrow$ VQA and +0.08$\\uparrow$ VTC), it accelerates native 4K video generation by more than 10$\\times$.

The model is built on the Wan2.2-5B backbone, integrating audio-injection layers and multiple training strategies together with threshold-aware codebook replacement to ensure long-term generation consistency. Meanwhile, step/CFG distillation and a lightweight VAE are used to optimize inference efficiency, achieving an 11.4$\\times$ speedup with negligible quality loss. Extensive experiments show that Soul significantly outperforms current leading open-source and commercial models on video quality, video-text alignment, identity preservation, and lip-synchronization accuracy, demonstrating broad applicability in real-world scenarios such as virtual anchors and film production.

Code available at: https://github.com/mariannerakic/Pancakes", "summary": "A single biomedical image can be meaningfully segmented in multiple ways, depending on the desired application. For instance, a brain MRI can be segmented according to tissue types, vascular territories, broad anatomical regions, fine-grained anatomy, or pathology, etc. Existing automatic segmentation models typically either (1) support only a single protocol, the one they were trained on, or (2) require labor-intensive manual prompting to specify the desired segmentation. We introduce Pancakes, a framework that, given a new image from a previously unseen domain, automatically generates multi-label segmentation maps for multiple plausible protocols, while maintaining semantic consistency across related images. Pancakes introduces a new problem formulation that is not currently attainable by existing foundation models. In a series of experiments on seven held-out datasets, we demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform existing foundation models in producing several plausible whole-image segmentations, that are semantically coherent across images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Pancakes\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5272\u56fe\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5355\u4e00\u534f\u8bae\u6216\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u652f\u6301\u5355\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u6307\u5b9a\u6240\u9700\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "Pancakes\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u65b0\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5272\u56fe\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u9884\u7559\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5168\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Pancakes\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u534f\u8bae\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

However, as humans by nature tend to act in a collaborative manner, behavioral anomalies can also arise from human-human interactions. Detecting such anomalies using existing single-person AD models is prone to low accuracy, as these approaches are typically not designed to capture the complex and asymmetric dynamics of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection (H2IAD), which aims to identify anomalous interactive behaviors within collaborative 3D human actions. To address H2IAD, we then propose Interaction Anomaly Detection Network (IADNet), which is formalized with a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM). Specifically, in designing TASM, we share the encoded motion embeddings across both people such that collaborative motion correlations can be effectively synchronized. Moreover, we notice that in addition to temporal dynamics, human interactions are also characterized by spatial configurations between two people. We thus introduce a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to better reflect social cues in H2IAD. The normalizing flow is eventually employed for anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments on human-human motion benchmarks demonstrate that IADNet outperforms existing Human-centric AD baselines in H2IAD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08H2IAD\uff09\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86IADNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u5e8f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5757\uff08TASM\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\uff08DREM\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u53cc\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4eba\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee5\u5355\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u5e38\u6e90\u4e8e\u4eba\u4e0e\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faH2IAD\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u6784\u5efaIADNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u65f6\u5e8f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5757\uff08TASM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4eba\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee5\u540c\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\uff08DREM\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u9645\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u578b\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u793e\u4ea4\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u6253\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cIADNet\u5728H2IAD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4ee5\u5355\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "H2IAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0cIADNet\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach.

LiMo targets both realistic high-frequency detail prediction and accurate illuminance estimation. To account for both, we propose generating a set of mirrored and diffuse spheres at different exposures, based on their 3D positions in the input. Making use of diffusion priors, we fine-tune powerful existing diffusion models on a large-scale customized dataset of indoor and outdoor scenes, paired with spatiotemporal light probes.

However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting. Our results demonstrate that lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision can effectively enhance PFM-based MIL pipelines for clinically challenging histopathology tasks.

However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios.

The agent is equipped with a Perceptive Zoomer (PZ) for localized fine-grained analysis and a Comparative Retriever (CR) for querying normal exemplars when evidence is ambiguous. To teach these inspection behaviors, we construct structured perceptive and comparative trajectories from the MMAD dataset and train the model in two stages: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. A two-part reward design drives this process: a perception reward that supervises classification accuracy, spatial alignment, and type correctness, and a behavior reward that encourages efficient tool use. Together, these components enable the model to refine its judgment through step-wise observation, zooming, and verification.

Despite recent encouraging advances, existing methods face two critical limitations. First, most existing approaches can only generate ambient sounds and lack the capability to produce human speech synchronized with lip movements. Second, recent attempts at unified human video-audio generation typically rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules, which introduce additional architecture design and weaken the model simplicity of the original transformers. To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that JoVA outperforms or is competitive with both unified and audio-driven state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity.

We present a feedforward method, Steer3D, to add text steerability to image-to-3D models, which enables editing of generated 3D assets with language. Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass. We build a scalable data engine for automatic data generation, and develop a two-stage training recipe based on flow-matching training and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Compared to competing methods, Steer3D more faithfully follows the language instruction and maintains better consistency with the original 3D asset, while being 2.4x to 28.5x faster. Steer3D demonstrates that it is possible to add a new modality (text) to steer the generation of pretrained image-to-3D generative models with 100k data.

While existing streaming methods address this through learned memory mechanisms or causal attention, they require extensive retraining and may not fully leverage the strong geometric priors of state-of-the-art offline models. We propose LASER, a training-free framework that converts an offline reconstruction model into a streaming system by aligning predictions across consecutive temporal windows. We observe that simple similarity transformation ($\\mathrm{Sim}(3)$) alignment fails due to layer depth misalignment: monocular scale ambiguity causes relative depth scales of different scene layers to vary inconsistently between windows. To address this, we introduce layer-wise scale alignment, which segments depth predictions into discrete layers, computes per-layer scale factors, and propagates them across both adjacent windows and timestamps. Extensive experiments show that LASER achieves state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and point map reconstruction %quality with offline models while operating at 14 FPS with 6 GB peak memory on a RTX A6000 GPU, enabling practical deployment for kilometer-scale streaming videos.

Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts. We instead reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene level learner, replacing dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures.

However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS.

We analyse the role of different computational blocks in 3D point cloud networks and find an intuitive behaviour: convolution is adequate to extract low-level geometry at high-resolution in early layers, where attention is expensive without bringing any benefits; attention captures high-level semantics and context in low-resolution, deep layers more efficiently. Guided by this design principle, we propose a new, improved 3D point cloud backbone that employs convolutions in early stages and switches to attention for deeper layers. To avoid the loss of spatial layout information when discarding redundant convolution layers, we introduce a novel, training-free 3D positional encoding, PointROPE. The resulting LitePT model has $3.6\\times$ fewer parameters, runs $2\\times$ faster, and uses $2\\times$ less memory than the state-of-the-art Point Transformer V3, but nonetheless matches or even outperforms it on a range of tasks and datasets.
