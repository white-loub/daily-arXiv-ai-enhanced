However,\ntheir static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands\n-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by\nprivacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,\nincluding retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often\ncomputationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or\ncontinuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:\nrethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in\ncapability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies\nknowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than\nencoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics\nto dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by\nremoving the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or\naccess to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves\npredictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten\nones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security\nguarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal\nprevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.\nThis ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against\nunauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for\ndeployment in sensitive and regulated environments.

Our objective is to accurately predict the\nimpact point, defined as the object's landing position. This task poses two key\nchallenges: the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under\nunsteady aerodynamics, which are essential for training reliable predictors;\nand the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when\ntrajectories appear similar across objects. To overcome these issues, we\nconstruct a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects, providing\na foundation for advancing in-flight object catching under complex\naerodynamics. We then propose the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP),\nconsisting of two modules: (i) a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) that\nseparates trajectories by dynamics to enable early-stage discrimination and\ngeneralization, and (ii) an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) that estimates the\nimpact point from these features. Two IPP variants are implemented: an Neural\nAcceleration Estimator (NAE)-based method that predicts trajectories and\nderives the impact point, and a Direct Point Estimator (DPE)-based method that\ndirectly outputs it. Experimental results show that our dataset is more diverse\nand complex than existing dataset, and that our method outperforms baselines on\nboth 15 seen and 5 unseen objects.

This paper\ninvestigates this phenomenon by evaluating LLMs on the task of automated\nprocess modeling, where the goal is to generate a formal business process model\nfrom a given source artifact. The domain of Business Process Management (BPM)\nprovides an ideal context for this study, as many core business processes\nfollow standardized patterns, making it likely that LLMs possess strong\npre-trained schemas for them. We conduct a controlled experiment designed to\ncreate scenarios with deliberate conflict between provided evidence and the\nLLM's background knowledge. We use inputs describing both standard and\ndeliberately atypical process structures to measure the LLM's fidelity to the\nprovided evidence.

It features a lightweight\n3D-printed and laser cut structure weighing 1.75 kg with dimensions of 310 mm x\n200 mm x 120 mm. Its legs have been designed with a simple Single Degree of\nFreedom (DOF) using a link and crank mechanism. It is great for conquering\nchallenging terrains such as grass, rocks, and steep surfaces. Unlike\ntraditional robots using four wheels for motion, its legged design gives\nsuperior adaptability to uneven and rough surfaces. GiAnt's control system is\nbuilt on Arduino, allowing manual operation. An effective way of controlling\nthe legs of GiAnt was achieved by gait analysis.

We further identify key challenges in applying GenAI to\nwireless sensing and outline a future direction toward a wireless foundation\nmodel: a unified, pre-trained design capable of scalable, adaptable, and\nefficient signal understanding across diverse sensing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u4ef6\u6216\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u65e0\u7ebf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0GenAI\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83GAN\u3001VAE\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "GenAI\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u53d1\u5c55\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00\u4fe1\u53f7\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Widely\nadopted tree-search methods often suffer from exponential computational\ncomplexity. In this work, we introduce FragmentRetro, a novel retrosynthetic\nmethod that leverages fragmentation algorithms, specifically BRICS and r-BRICS,\ncombined with stock-aware exploration and pattern fingerprint screening to\nachieve quadratic complexity. FragmentRetro recursively combines molecular\nfragments and verifies their presence in a building block set, providing sets\nof fragment combinations as retrosynthetic solutions. We present the first\nformal computational analysis of retrosynthetic methods, showing that tree\nsearch exhibits exponential complexity $O(b^h)$, DirectMultiStep scales as\n$O(h^6)$, and FragmentRetro achieves $O(h^2)$, where $h$ represents the number\nof heavy atoms in the target molecule and $b$ is the branching factor for tree\nsearch.

Having accurate force feedback is important for enabling\nsonographers to apply the appropriate probe contact force to optimize\nultrasound image quality. However, large time delays in communication make\ndirect force feedback impractical. Prior work investigated using point\ncloud-based model-mediated teleoperation and internal potential field models to\nestimate contact forces and torques. We expand on this by introducing a method\nto update the internal potential field model of the patient with measured\npositions and forces for more transparent model-mediated tele-ultrasound. We\nfirst generate a point cloud model of the patient's surface and transmit this\nto the sonographer in a compact data structure.

These\nvalues determine the forces and torques, which are rendered based on overlap\nbetween the voxelized volume and a point shell model of the ultrasound\ntransducer. We solve for the potential field using a convex quadratic that\ncombines the spatial Laplace operator with measured forces.

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish.

Extensive experiments across five LLMs and six domains demonstrate\nthe benefits of our HERO, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 2.5-3 mAP on\naverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHERO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5668\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u64b0\u5199\u3001\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u3001\u673a\u5668\u6da6\u8272\u548c\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u56db\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u673a\u64b0\u5199\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7528\u9014\u5982\u6da6\u8272\u6216\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6076\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\u6216\u5e7b\u89c9\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u957f\u5ea6\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u6613\u6df7\u6dc6\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHERO\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53472.5-3 mAP\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HERO\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u673a\u5668\u5f71\u54cd\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

For example, image views are filtered\nbased on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract\nnavigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,\nwe focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss.

Current diffusion\nmodels can address the problem of correcting the timing of imprecisely timed\nposes, but we find that no good solution exists for leveraging the diffusion\nprior to enhance a sparse set of blocking poses with additional pose detail. We\novercome this challenge using a simple inference-time trick.

A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with\nweight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting\nhuman-centered optimization.

While originally proposed for the language data,\nthey quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities\nwith various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the\nattention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales\nfrom potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to\nincorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based\non ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar\nproblems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in\nthis paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a\nmathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then\nmathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct\nfrom the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived\nformulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard\nSoftmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the\nhierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an\nefficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived\nattention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the\nproposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train\ntransformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it\ncan also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained\ntransformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in\nzero-shot manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u539f\u7406\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u9002\u914d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e34\u65f6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u793a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c42\u6b21\u5316Transformer\uff0c\u4ea6\u53ef\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6ce8\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001/\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5177\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, recent work\nhas explored augmenting LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) to provide structured,\nup-to-date information. However, many existing approaches assume a static\nsnapshot of the KG and overlook the temporal dynamics and factual\ninconsistencies inherent in real-world data. To address the challenge of\nreasoning over temporally shifting knowledge, we propose EvoReasoner, a\ntemporal-aware multi-hop reasoning algorithm that performs global-local entity\ngrounding, multi-route decomposition, and temporally grounded scoring. To\nensure that the underlying KG remains accurate and up-to-date, we introduce\nEvoKG, a noise-tolerant KG evolution module that incrementally updates the KG\nfrom unstructured documents through confidence-based contradiction resolution\nand temporal trend tracking. We evaluate our approach on temporal QA benchmarks\nand a novel end-to-end setting where the KG is dynamically updated from raw\ndocuments. Our method outperforms both prompting-based and KG-enhanced\nbaselines, effectively narrowing the gap between small and large LLMs on\ndynamic question answering.

While recent\nstudies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the\nstructure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we\nsystematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation\nmodels using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models\nanalyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and\nself-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through\nrepresentational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find\nthat UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,\nwhereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having\nthe same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee\nhigher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a\nhigh slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain\nnormalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%\n(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP).

Many existing unlearning methods aim to\nsuppress undesirable outputs through additional training (e.g., gradient\nascent), which reduces the probability of generating such outputs. While such\nsuppression-based approaches can control model outputs, they may not eliminate\nthe underlying knowledge embedded in the model's internal activations; muting a\nresponse is not the same as forgetting it. Moreover, such suppression-based\nmethods often suffer from model collapse. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel unlearning method that directly intervenes in the model's internal\nactivations. In our formulation, forgetting is defined as a state in which the\nactivation of a forgotten target is indistinguishable from that of ``unknown''\nentities. Our method introduces an unlearning objective that modifies the\nactivation of the target entity away from those of known entities and toward\nthose of unknown entities in a sparse autoencoder latent space. By aligning the\ntarget's internal activation with those of unknown entities, we shift the\nmodel's recognition of the target entity from ``known'' to ``unknown'',\nachieving genuine forgetting while avoiding over-suppression and model\ncollapse. Empirically, we show that our method effectively aligns the internal\nactivations of the forgotten target, a result that the suppression-based\napproaches do not reliably achieve.

In reinforcement\nlearning (RL), they enable return-conditioned control without relying on value\nfunction approximation. Decision Transformers (DTs) exploit this by casting RL\nas supervised sequence modeling, but they are restricted to offline data and\nlack exploration. Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) address this limitation\nthrough entropy-regularized training on on-policy rollouts, offering a stable\nalternative to traditional RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic, which depend on\nbootstrapped targets and reward shaping. Despite these advantages, ODTs use\nstandard attention, which lacks explicit memory of action-specific outcomes.\nThis leads to inefficiencies in learning long-term action effectiveness.\nInspired by cognitive models such as Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA), we\npropose Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization for Online\nDecision Transformers (EWA-VQ-ODT), a lightweight module that maintains\nper-action mental accounts summarizing recent successes and failures.\nContinuous actions are routed via direct grid lookup to a compact\nvector-quantized codebook, where each code stores a scalar attraction updated\nonline through decay and reward-based reinforcement. These attractions modulate\nattention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no\nchange to the backbone or training objective.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \\emph{selection} mechanism\nto identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an\n\\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two\ncomplementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through\nthe inverse mask.

The inner\nproblem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer\nproblem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing\nclean-task accuracy.

Specifically, DAC\nattributes the non-stationary local task dynamics of each agent to switches\nbetween unobserved contexts, each corresponding to a distinct joint policy.\nThen, DAC models the step-wise dynamics distribution using latent variables and\nrefers to them as contexts. For each agent, DAC introduces a context-based\nvalue function to address the non-stationarity issue during value function\nupdate.

Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and\nemotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire\nunderstanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis\npredominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary\nnon-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional\nMultimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,\nwhich enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively\ncapture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,\nlow-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for\ncross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into\nsub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to\ncapture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an\nimage-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal\ninteraction at both local and global representations of image information.\nAdditionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale\nimage strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into\nsub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a\nmultimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as\nemotion and sentiment recognition.

Red teaming\nimproves SID's effectiveness by identifying and exploiting their failure modes\nvia misclassified synthetic images. However, existing red-teaming solutions (i)\nrequire white-box access to SIDs, which is infeasible for proprietary\nstate-of-the-art detectors, and (ii) generate image-specific attacks through\nexpensive online optimization. To address these limitations, we propose\nPolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs,\nbased on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples\ncorrectly and incorrectly classified by the SID. PolyJuice generates attacks by\n(i) identifying the direction of this shift through a lightweight offline\nprocess that only requires black-box access to the SID, and (ii) exploiting\nthis direction by universally steering all generated images towards the SID's\nfailure modes.

Although recent advances in\nvision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning\nand task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability\nto recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored\nchallenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot\nexecutes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given\ninstruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets\ntargeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing\nlanguage-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an\nopen-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for\nfailure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by\ntraining lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to\ndifferent internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using\nan ensembling mechanism.

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified\nprinciple address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and\nfoster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective.

(3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously\n(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,\nLZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA\nclassification accuracy on CIFAR10.

We first present a novel\nperspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD\nmetrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the\nprediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet\npotentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading\nto biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this\nchallenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.\nThe core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then\naggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size\nimbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated\noptimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle\nand significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad\nrange of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly\nintegrated with a wide range of SOD backbones.

Building on this view, we\nintroduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVD), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and\ntheoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and\nextract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\ngradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained\nmodels. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to\nsteer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We\ntheoretically prove that SVD is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of\nfull fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the\nsteering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVD paired with four\nstandard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 points and\nopen-ended truthfulness by 2 points, with similar gains (1-2 points) on\ncommonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT\nadapter.

Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized\nstrategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client\ncommonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)\ncomponent to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled\nglobal-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm\nvia knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model\nand the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach\nsignificantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain\nadaptation, and reduces communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8054\u90a6SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u9700\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u963b\u788d\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u805a\u5408\u4e0eL-MoE\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u5fae\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

On GLUE, AG News, and\nCIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy\nloss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption.\nThese results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network\ndistillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "RMT-KD\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7f51\u7edc\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9010\u5c42\u4fdd\u7559\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b080%\u53c2\u6570\u538b\u7f29\u30012.8\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u4e0e\u8fd1\u534a\u529f\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4ec52%\u3002", "conclusion": "RMT-KD\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u624e\u5b9e\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, training\nlarge-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial\nmemory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,\nwhich can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we\npropose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a\nsubset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this\ndramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and\noptimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's\nlimited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three\nsystem-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters\nfor fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer\nupdates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize\nunnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive\nevaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly\nlowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds\ncomparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian\nSplatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the\nnumber of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,\nleading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)\nimprovement.", "AI": {"tldr": "GS-Scale \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u7684 3D \u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7 GPU \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 3D \u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d GPU \u5185\u5b58\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u5b58\u4e8e\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u6309\u9700\u4f20\u8f93\u81f3 GPU\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9879\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5378\u8f7d\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u524d\u5411\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "GPU \u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u964d\u4f4e 3.3-5.6 \u500d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5168 GPU \u65b9\u6848\uff0cRTX 4070 Mobile \u4e0a\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u4ece 400 \u4e07\u6269\u81f3 1800 \u4e07\uff0cLPIPS \u63d0\u5347 23-35%\u3002", "conclusion": "GS-Scale \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684 3D \u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u95e8\u69db\u3002"}}

Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,\nreconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and\nreconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates\nhigh-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the\nperformances for contactless fingerprint recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u6307\u7eb9\u4e09\u7ef4\u6ce8\u518c\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9690\u5f0f\u4e09\u7ef4\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u54083D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e09\u7ef4\u6ce8\u518c\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7cbe\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u5efa\u4e09\u7ef4\u6307\u7eb9\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u6307\u7eb9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u5c063D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5f15\u5165\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In\nhandwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the\nsample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the\ncalligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word\nspacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in\ninconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes\nmulti-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These\nmulti-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.\nSecondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word\nspacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional\ndiffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly\ngenerated style images.

To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG),\na persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level\nplanning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions\nin one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit\nblueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation.\nBuilding on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository\ngeneration from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning\nand implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by\ngraph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we\nconstruct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks.\nOn RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly\n3.9$\\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\\times$ other\nbaselines.

However, existing COD\nbenchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for\nmultispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address\nthis gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset\nspecifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD\nfeatures three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It\ncaptures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme\nlighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world\nscenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better\nreflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:\nEach image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding\nchallenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on\nMCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.\nNotably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this\ndegradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing\ndetection robustness.

SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%\nDice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms\nexisting methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios\n(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our\nSegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on\nsegmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a\nsegmentation problem.

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research\ndue to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture\nfine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular\nmemory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view\nmethods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic\nsegmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the\nrapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot\nrecognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current\nstate-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for\nLiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view.

To optimize SAM2 for\nrange-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to\nthe encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies\ninherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to\nthe geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism\nin the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial\npatterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images.

In addition, to further enhance the reasoning\ncapability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning\nand goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable\nprojection.

While existing methods\naddress training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination\nmodels, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model\nsubsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified\nmodality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical\nself-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges\nrepresentation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,\nfeature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the\nhybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the\nintrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for\nmissing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant\ncontrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among\nincomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight\nreverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual\nsemantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid\nconsistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality\ncombinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and\nwhistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under\ndiverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D\nsemantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation.
