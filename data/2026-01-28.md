*Zeineb Dridi,Jihen Bennaceur,Amine Ben Hassouna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于动态掩码的新型后门攻击方法，利用SAM模型在目标检测（如YOLOv7）中实现高隐蔽性、高成功率的后门注入，并以蘑菇检测数据集为例揭示外包训练场景下的现实安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在实际部署中面临日益增多的对抗攻击威胁，尤其是外包训练场景下数据投毒引发的后门攻击风险亟待系统评估；现有静态触发器方法隐蔽性差、适应性弱。

Method: 提出基于SAM（Segment Anything Model）生成动态掩码的后门攻击方法，通过数据集投毒嵌入可变位置与形态的触发器，针对对象检测任务（如YOLOv7）实施攻击。

Result: 在蘑菇检测数据集上验证：攻击后模型在干净样本上保持高精度，同时对带触发样本实现高攻击成功率，显著优于传统静态触发方法。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized numerous tasks within the computer vision field, including image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats.

Abstract: Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated considerable success in generating high-fidelity 3D models of talking portraits. Despite significant advancements in the rendering speed and generation quality, challenges persist in accurately and efficiently capturing mouth movements in talking portraits. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic method based on blink embedding and hash grid landmarks encoding in this study, which can substantially enhance the fidelity of talking faces. Specifically, we leverage facial features encoded as conditional features and integrate audio features as residual terms into our model through a Dynamic Landmark Transformer. Furthermore, we employ neural radiance fields to model the entire face, resulting in a lifelike face representation. Experimental evaluations have validated the superiority of our approach to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

Abstract: Head avatar reenactment focuses on creating animatable personal avatars from monocular videos, serving as a foundational element for applications like social signal understanding, gaming, human-machine interaction, and computer vision. Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior head avatar reconstruction with rich and intricate textures compared to existing approaches.

### [4] [Weakly supervised framework for wildlife detection and counting in challenging Arctic environments: a case study on caribou (Rangifer tarandus)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18891)
*Ghazaleh Serati,Samuel Foucher,Jerome Theau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于弱监督斑块级预训练的检测模型HerdNet，用于在复杂背景和小目标条件下更鲁棒地自动检测北极驯鹿，显著提升了多群组航拍图像中的检测精度与计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北极驯鹿数量近年持续下降，亟需可扩展、高精度的监测方法；而人工解译耗时易错，自动检测又面临背景异质性强、类别不平衡、目标小且遮挡、密度与尺度变化大等挑战。

Method: 提出一种基于检测网络架构的弱监督斑块级预训练方法（HerdNet），利用空/非空粗标签在五个阿拉斯加驯鹿群数据集上进行预训练，再迁移至精细检测任务。

Result: 在2017和2019年独立测试集上斑块检测F1达93.7%/92.6%；迁移到检测后，正样本斑块F1为92.6%/93.5%（优于ImageNet初始化的89.3%/88.6%），全图计数F1为95.5%/93.3%（优于91.5%/90.4%）。

Conclusion: 弱监督预训练可在标注数据有限时替代通用预训练权重，显著提升检测鲁棒性与实用性，为野生动物大规模航拍监测提供可靠技术路径。

Abstract: Caribou across the Arctic has declined in recent decades, motivating scalable and accurate monitoring approaches to guide evidence-based conservation actions and policy decisions. Manual interpretation from this imagery is labor-intensive and error-prone, underscoring the need for automatic and reliable detection across varying scenes. Yet, such automatic detection is challenging due to severe background heterogeneity, dominant empty terrain (class imbalance), small or occluded targets, and wide variation in density and scale. To make the detection model (HerdNet) more robust to these challenges, a weakly supervised patch-level pretraining based on a detection network's architecture is proposed. The detection dataset includes five caribou herds distributed across Alaska. By learning from empty vs. non-empty labels in this dataset, the approach produces early weakly supervised knowledge for enhanced detection compared to HerdNet, which is initialized from generic weights. Accordingly, the patch-based pretrain network attained high accuracy on multi-herd imagery (2017) and on an independent year's (2019) test sets (F1: 93.7%/92.6%, respectively), enabling reliable mapping of regions containing animals to facilitate manual counting on large aerial imagery. Transferred to detection, initialization from weakly supervised pretraining yielded consistent gains over ImageNet weights on both positive patches (F1: 92.6%/93.5% vs. 89.3%/88.6%), and full-image counting (F1: 95.5%/93.3% vs. 91.5%/90.4%). Remaining limitations are false positives from animal-like background clutter and false negatives related to low animal density occlusions. Overall, pretraining on coarse labels prior to detection makes it possible to rely on weakly-supervised pretrained weights even when labeled data are limited, achieving results comparable to generic-weight initialization.

### [5] [RealStats: A Rigorous Real-Only Statistical Framework for Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18900)
*Haim Zisman,Uri Shaham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于统计学的、无需训练的通用假图像检测框架，通过多检测器的p值聚合，提供对真实图像分布可解释的概率评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测方法缺乏形式化的可解释性，且依赖于对伪造内容的隐式假设，导致在分布偏移下鲁棒性不足。

Method: 利用多个现有检测器的训练-free统计量，计算一系列检验统计量的p值，并通过经典统计集成方法聚合，以评估图像与统一真实图像分布的一致性。

Result: 该框架具有通用性、灵活性和无需训练的特点，在多样化和动态变化的场景中展现出稳健的假图像检测能力。

Conclusion: 所提统计框架为假图像检测提供了形式化、可解释且鲁棒的解决方案，弥补了现有方法在可解释性和分布外泛化上的不足。

Abstract: As generative models continue to evolve, detecting AI-generated images remains a critical challenge. While effective detection methods exist, they often lack formal interpretability and may rely on implicit assumptions about fake content, potentially limiting robustness to distributional shifts. In this work, we introduce a rigorous, statistically grounded framework for fake image detection that focuses on producing a probability score interpretable with respect to the real-image population. Our method leverages the strengths of multiple existing detectors by combining training-free statistics. We compute p-values over a range of test statistics and aggregate them using classical statistical ensembling to assess alignment with the unified real-image distribution. This framework is generic, flexible, and training-free, making it well-suited for robust fake image detection across diverse and evolving settings.

### [6] [On the Role of Depth in Surgical Vision Foundation Models: An Empirical Study of RGB-D Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18929)
*John J. Han,Adam Schmidt,Muhammad Abdullah Jamal,Chinedu Nwoye,Anita Rau,Jie Ying Wu,Omid Mohareri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模实证研究，比较了八种基于ViT的视觉基础模型在手术场景中的性能，发现结合深度信息（RGB-D）进行几何感知预训练（如MultiMAE）显著提升各类手术视觉任务表现，并大幅提高数据效率，且无需改变推理时的架构或运行开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术视觉基础模型主要依赖单模态RGB预训练，忽视手术环境固有的复杂3D几何结构；而深度信息在手术场景中的潜在价值尚未被充分探索。

Method: 构建包含140万张配对RGB-深度图的手术图像数据集，对比八种ViT-based VFM（在预训练领域、学习目标和输入模态上不同），在冻结主干和端到端微调两种协议下，在八个涵盖检测、分割、深度估计与位姿估计的手术数据集上系统评估。

Result: 显式几何tokenization模型（如MultiMAE）在所有任务上均显著优于单模态基线；仅用25%标注数据微调的几何感知模型，性能即超越使用全部数据训练的RGB-only模型；该增益不增加推理开销，因深度仅用于预训练。

Conclusion: 多模态（RGB-D）预训练是构建更强大手术视觉系统的一条可行且高效路径。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for surgical scene understanding. However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SplitFed学习中通信信道噪声会损害模型训练过程和最终模型质量，需提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一种面向SplitFed学习的智能平均策略，以提升对通信信道噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 在胚胎图像分割模型上实验表明，所提策略可容忍比传统平均方法强两个数量级的信道噪声，同时保持最终模型精度。

Conclusion: 智能平均策略显著提升了SplitFed学习在噪声信道下的稳定性与实用性。

Abstract: Split-Federated (SplitFed) learning is an extension of federated learning that places minimal requirements on the clients computing infrastructure, since only a small portion of the overall model is deployed on the clients hardware. In SplitFed learning, feature values, gradient updates, and model updates are transferred across communication channels. In this paper, we study the effects of noise in the communication channels on the learning process and the quality of the final model. We propose a smart averaging strategy for SplitFed learning with the goal of improving resilience against channel noise. Experiments on a segmentation model for embryo images shows that the proposed smart averaging strategy is able to tolerate two orders of magnitude stronger noise in the communication channels compared to conventional averaging, while still maintaining the accuracy of the final model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种相机加权机制，通过几何或交叉注意力方式动态调整输入视角对目标视角的重要性，从而提升少样本新视角合成（NVS）的质量与真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本新视角合成方法假设所有输入视角对目标视角同等重要，导致合成效果次优。

Result: 实验表明，自适应视角加权显著提升了新视角合成的精度与真实感。

Conclusion: 相机加权机制是一种通用、有效的改进策略，为少样本NVS提供了新方向。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) has advanced with generative modeling, enabling photorealistic image generation. In few-shot NVS, where only a few input views are available, existing methods often assume equal importance for all input views relative to the target, leading to suboptimal results.
  We address this limitation by introducing a camera-weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of source views based on their relevance to the target. We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality. This mechanism is adaptable and can be integrated into various NVS algorithms, improving their ability to synthesize high-quality novel views. Our results demonstrate that adaptive view weighting enhances accuracy and realism, offering a promising direction for improving NVS.

TL;DR: 本文提出FreeOrbit4D，一种无需训练的框架，通过构建几何完备的4D代理（结合静态背景与对象中心多视角扩散重建的前景），为单目视频的大角度相机重定向提供结构支撑，显著提升重定向视频的几何一致性和时序连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大角度相机重定向因单目视频观测信息严重不足，导致几何模糊和时序不一致，现有扩散方法在此场景下性能下降明显。

Method: FreeOrbit4D解耦前景与背景重建：将单目视频反投影至统一全局空间得到静态背景和几何不完备的前景点云；利用对象中心多视角扩散模型合成多视角图像并重建几何完备的前景点云于规范对象空间；通过密集像素同步的3D-3D对应关系对齐前景至全局空间，形成几何完备的4D代理，并以此引导条件视频扩散模型生成重定向视频。

Result: 在大角度轨迹下，FreeOrbit4D生成的重定向视频在几何保真度与时序一致性上优于现有方法；其生成的4D代理还支持编辑传播与4D数据生成等下游应用。

Conclusion: FreeOrbit4D通过引入几何完备的4D代理作为结构先验，有效缓解了单目大角度重定向中的病态性问题，是一种高效、无需训练的新范式。

Abstract: Camera redirection aims to replay a dynamic scene from a single monocular video under a user-specified camera trajectory. However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation. Project page and code will be released soon.

### [10] [Anatomically-aware conformal prediction for medical image segmentation with random walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18997)
*Mélanie Gaillochet,Christian Desrosiers,Hervé Lombaert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Random-Walk Conformal Prediction（RW-CP）的新方法，用于医学图像分割中的不确定性量化。该方法在保持统计有效性的同时，通过图上的随机游走扩散不确定性，增强预测集的空间连贯性和解剖学合理性，显著提升分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的共形预测（CP）在医学图像分割中忽略解剖结构上下文，导致预测结果碎片化、空间不连贯、过度分割，临床实用性受限；亟需一种能兼顾统计保证与解剖意义的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 提出模型无关的RW-CP框架：基于预训练视觉基础模型提取特征构建k近邻图，利用随机游走对非一致性分数进行扩散正则化，从而生成空间连贯、解剖合理的预测集，并保持边际覆盖保证。

Result: 在多模态公开数据集上评估显示，RW-CP相较标准CP基线，在允许错误率α=0.1下分割性能提升最高达35.4%，且预测边界更稳定连续，覆盖保证严格成立。

Conclusion: RW-CP有效弥合了统计严谨性与临床解剖合理性之间的鸿沟，为可信医学AI提供了可即插即用、理论保障强、解剖感知的不确定性量化新范式。

Abstract: The reliable deployment of deep learning in medical imaging requires uncertainty quantification that provides rigorous error guarantees while remaining anatomically meaningful. Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals. However, standard applications in segmentation often ignore anatomical context, resulting in fragmented, spatially incoherent, and over-segmented prediction sets that limit clinical utility. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Random-Walk Conformal Prediction (RW-CP), a model-agnostic framework which can be added on top of any segmentation method. RW-CP enforces spatial coherence to generate anatomically valid sets. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbour graph from pre-trained vision foundation model features and applies a random walk to diffuse uncertainty. The random walk diffusion regularizes the non-conformity scores, making the prediction sets less sensitive to the conformal calibration parameter $λ$, ensuring more stable and continuous anatomical boundaries. RW-CP maintains rigorous marginal coverage while significantly improving segmentation quality. Evaluations on multi-modal public datasets show improvements of up to $35.4\%$ compared to standard CP baselines, given an allowable error rate of $α=0.1$.

Abstract: Chronic wound monitoring and management require accurate and efficient wound measurement methods. This paper presents a fast, non-invasive 3D wound measurement algorithm based on RGB-D imaging. The method combines RGB-D odometry with B-spline surface reconstruction to generate detailed 3D wound meshes, enabling automatic computation of clinically relevant wound measurements such as perimeter, surface area, and dimensions. We evaluated our system on realistic silicone wound phantoms and measured sub-millimetre 3D reconstruction accuracy compared with high-resolution ground-truth scans. The extracted measurements demonstrated low variability across repeated captures and strong agreement with manual assessments. The proposed pipeline also outperformed a state-of-the-art object-centric RGB-D reconstruction method while maintaining runtimes suitable for real-time clinical deployment. Our approach offers a promising tool for automated wound assessment in both clinical and remote healthcare settings.

Abstract: We introduce a novel motion capture system that reconstructs full-body 3D motion using only sparse pairwise distance (PWD) measurements from body-mounted(UWB) sensors. Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild. Our empirical analysis highlights its potential for scalable, low-cost, and general purpose motion capture in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统皮层特征图依赖离散结构（如网格、三角剖分），难以泛化至任意分辨率和尺寸，且球面优化效率低；亟需一种连续、可微、高效率的表示方法以支持鲁棒、快速的皮层表面配准。

Method: 提出神经皮层图——一种参数化在球面上的连续神经隐式函数，可从任意大小网格学习并输出任意位置的特征；在此基础上构建NC-Reg算法：结合神经皮层特征图提取、梯度下降优化与模拟退火策略，实现迭代式刚性配准。

Conclusion: 神经皮层图是一种高效、灵活、可微的皮层特征表示范式；NC-Reg算法展示了其在球面刚性配准任务中的优越性能，为脑影像分析提供了新工具与新思路。

Abstract: We introduce neural cortical maps, a continuous and compact neural representation for cortical feature maps, as an alternative to traditional discrete structures such as grids and meshes. It can learn from meshes of arbitrary size and provide learnt features at any resolution. Neural cortical maps enable efficient optimization on the sphere and achieve runtimes up to 30 times faster than classic barycentric interpolation (for the same number of iterations). As a proof of concept, we investigate rigid registration of cortical surfaces and propose NC-Reg, a novel iterative algorithm that involves the use of neural cortical feature maps, gradient descent optimization and a simulated annealing strategy. Through ablation studies and subject-to-template experiments, our method demonstrates sub-degree accuracy ($<1^\circ$ from the global optimum), and serves as a promising robust pre-alignment strategy, which is critical in clinical settings.

Abstract: World generation is a fundamental capability for applications like video games, simulation, and robotics. However, existing approaches face three main obstacles: controllability, scalability, and efficiency. End-to-end scene generation models have been limited by data scarcity. While object-centric generation approaches rely on fixed resolution representations, degrading fidelity for larger scenes. Training-free approaches, while flexible, are often slow and computationally expensive at inference time. We present NuiWorld, a framework that attempts to address these challenges. To overcome data scarcity, we propose a generative bootstrapping strategy that starts from a few input images. Leveraging recent 3D reconstruction and expandable scene generation techniques, we synthesize scenes of varying sizes and layouts, producing enough data to train an end-to-end model. Furthermore, our framework enables controllability through pseudo sketch labels, and demonstrates a degree of generalization to previously unseen sketches. Our approach represents scenes as a collection of variable scene chunks, which are compressed into a flattened vector-set representation. This significantly reduces the token length for large scenes, enabling consistent geometric fidelity across scenes sizes while improving training and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: PixSearch是一种端到端的多模态检索增强生成模型，通过引入<search>标记、支持多模态查询（文本/图像/区域）及像素级掩码生成，统一区域感知与检索推理，显著提升VQA中的事实一致性与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答（VQA）方法在融合细粒度感知与外部事实知识时存在局限；已有MM-RAG系统缺乏对何时、如何检索的内部策略。

Method: 提出PixSearch：首个端到端分段式大语言多模态模型（LMM），在编码阶段动态生成<search>标记以触发检索，自适应选择查询模态，并输出像素级掩码作为视觉查询；采用两阶段监督微调，结合检索交错监督，兼顾检索时机、查询选择与分割能力。

Result: 在CRAG-MM等基准上相较全图检索提升19.7%相对准确率，在各类VQA和纯文本QA任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PixSearch实现了区域级感知与检索增强推理的统一，摆脱了传统模块化流水线依赖，为多模态问答提供了更鲁棒、可泛化的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) often requires coupling fine-grained perception with factual knowledge beyond the input image. Prior multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) systems improve factual grounding but lack an internal policy for when and how to retrieve. We propose PixSearch, the first end-to-end Segmenting Large Multimodal Model (LMM) that unifies region-level perception and retrieval-augmented reasoning. During encoding, PixSearch emits <search> tokens to trigger retrieval, selects query modalities (text, image, or region), and generates pixel-level masks that directly serve as visual queries, eliminating the reliance on modular pipelines (detectors, segmenters, captioners, etc.). A two-stage supervised fine-tuning regimen with search-interleaved supervision teaches retrieval timing and query selection while preserving segmentation ability. On egocentric and entity-centric VQA benchmarks, PixSearch substantially improves factual consistency and generalization, yielding a 19.7% relative gain in accuracy on CRAG-MM compared to whole image retrieval, while retaining competitive reasoning performance on various VQA and text-only QA tasks.

*Yosub Shin,Michael Buriek,Igor Molybog*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了m2sv基准，用于评估视觉-语言模型在地图到街景空间推理任务中的性能，发现现有模型在此任务上表现远低于人类水平，并揭示了几何对齐、证据聚合和推理一致性等方面的持续缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在多模态基准上表现良好，但在需要将抽象俯视图与自我中心视角对齐的空间推理任务上仍很脆弱。

Method: 构建了可扩展的m2sv基准（含m2sv-20k和m2sv-sft-11k数据集），并评估了多种VLM在该任务上的表现，结合监督微调、强化学习及系统性失败分析。

Result: 最佳VLM在m2sv上准确率仅为65.2%，显著低于人类基线95%；微调与强化学习带来稳定提升，但跨基准迁移能力有限；分析揭示了几何对齐、证据聚合与推理一致性三大瓶颈。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在跨视角空间推理方面存在根本性局限，亟需面向真实世界几何 grounding 的新方法。

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many multimodal benchmarks but remain brittle on spatial reasoning tasks that require aligning abstract overhead representations with egocentric views. We introduce m2sv, a scalable benchmark for map-to-street-view spatial reasoning that asks models to infer camera viewing direction by aligning a north-up overhead map with a Street View image captured at the same real-world intersection. We release m2sv-20k, a geographically diverse benchmark with controlled ambiguity, along with m2sv-sft-11k, a curated set of structured reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning.
  Despite strong performance on existing multimodal benchmarks, the best evaluated VLM achieves only 65.2% accuracy on m2sv, far below the human baseline of 95%. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield consistent gains, cross-benchmark evaluations reveal limited transfer. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we systematically analyze difficulty in map-to-street-view reasoning using both structural signals and human effort, and conduct an extensive failure analysis of adapted open models. Our findings highlight persistent gaps in geometric alignment, evidence aggregation, and reasoning consistency, motivating future work on grounded spatial reasoning across viewpoints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GF-Screen，一种基于“扫视-聚焦”策略的强化学习框架，用于大规模CT影像中的泛癌种筛查，通过Glance模型定位病灶区域、Focus模型精细分割，并利用分割结果反馈奖励Glance模型，结合组内相对学习范式提升效率与精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI方法难以在大尺度CT中准确定位多种微小病灶，且前景-背景极度不平衡导致模型关注健康区域、效率低、假阳性高。受放射科医生‘先扫视后聚焦’诊断策略启发，提出新框架解决该问题。

Method: GF-Screen包含Glance（粗定位，裁剪子体素）和Focus（精细分割）两个模型；Glance的选择操作不可微，故用Focus的分割结果作为RL奖励信号；引入组内相对学习范式，对子体素组内预测进行优势比较，优先优化高优势预测。

Result: 在16个内部+7个外部数据集、共9类病灶上验证有效；在MICCAI FLARE25泛癌挑战赛公开验证榜排名第一，DSC和NSD分别比FLARE24冠军高25.6%和28.2%。

Conclusion: GF-Screen首次成功将前沿强化学习技术适配于泛癌种CT筛查任务，在定位准确性、分割性能和临床实用性上取得显著突破，为大规模医学影像智能筛查提供了新范式。

Abstract: Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).

*Lin Chen,Yue He,Fengting Zhang,Yaonan Wang,Fengming Lin,Xiang Chen,Min Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Reg-TTR，一种测试时精调框架，结合深度学习与传统配准方法优势，在仅增加21%推理时间的前提下显著提升配准精度，达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像配准方法存在速度与鲁棒性难以兼顾的问题：传统方法鲁棒但慢，深度学习方法快但易受域偏移影响，而新兴的配准基础模型虽平衡二者，却难以达到专用模型的峰值精度。

Method: 提出Reg-TTR测试时精调框架，在推理阶段对预训练模型的预测结果进行优化，融合深度学习的高效性与传统方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 在两个不同任务上验证，Reg-TTR达到SOTA性能，推理时间仅增加0.56秒（21%），速度仍接近此前深度学习方法。

Conclusion: Reg-TTR为缩小配准基础模型与专用SOTA模型之间的性能差距提供了一种高效可行的策略。

Abstract: Traditional image registration methods are robust but slow due to their iterative nature. While deep learning has accelerated inference, it often struggles with domain shifts. Emerging registration foundation models offer a balance of speed and robustness, yet typically cannot match the peak accuracy of specialized models trained on specific datasets. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Reg-TTR, a test-time refinement framework that synergizes the complementary strengths of both deep learning and conventional registration techniques. By refining the predictions of pre-trained models at inference, our method delivers significantly improved registration accuracy at a modest computational cost, requiring only 21% additional inference time (0.56s). We evaluate Reg-TTR on two distinct tasks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining inference speeds close to previous deep learning methods. As foundation models continue to emerge, our framework offers an efficient strategy to narrow the performance gap between registration foundation models and SOTA methods trained on specialized datasets. The source code will be publicly available following the acceptance of this work.

*Xiang Gao,Yunpeng Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FBSDiff，一种从频域视角出发、无需训练的即插即用文本驱动图像到图像（I2I）转换框架，通过动态替换扩散模型隐空间特征的低/中/高频段实现外观/布局/轮廓引导的可控翻译；进一步升级为FBSDiff++，显著提升推理速度（8.9×）、支持任意分辨率输入，并拓展至局部编辑与风格化内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在文本到图像生成上已很成熟，但其自然延伸——文本驱动的图像到图像翻译（I2I）仍面临可控性、灵活性与效率不足的问题，尤其缺乏无需微调或重训练的即插即用方案。

Method: 提出基于频域的FBSDiff框架：在预训练T2I扩散模型的隐空间中，对不同频率带（低/中/高）的扩散特征进行动态替换，分别实现外观/布局/轮廓引导的I2I；引入带宽调节机制以连续控制源图相关强度；进一步提出FBSDiff++，优化架构加速推理、支持任意分辨率输入，并扩展至局部编辑和风格化生成。

Result: FBSDiff++在视觉质量、推理效率（8.9×加速）、任务多样性（外观/布局/轮廓引导、局部编辑、风格化）及可控性（带宽连续调节）方面均优于现有先进方法，且无需训练或微调。

Conclusion: 频域视角为即插即用式I2I翻译提供了新范式；FBSDiff及其增强版FBSDiff++在保持T2I模型不变的前提下，实现了高效、灵活、细粒度可控的文本驱动图像编辑，具有强实用性与可扩展性。

Abstract: With large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieving significant advancements in open-domain image creation, increasing attention has been focused on their natural extension to the realm of text-driven image-to-image (I2I) translation, where a source image acts as visual guidance to the generated image in addition to the textual guidance provided by the text prompt. We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of FBSDiff++ in I2I translation visual quality, efficiency, versatility, and controllability compared to related advanced approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GB-DAL方法，通过原型粒球分割（PGBS）和模拟非因果因子（SNF）模块，缓解开放世界目标检测中因稀疏域标签和隐式数据偏差导致的非因果因子问题，提升跨域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界目标检测中，现有基于域对抗学习（DAL）的域泛化方法难以有效处理隐式非因果因子，主要受限于域标签极度稀疏及数据偏差引发的非因果因子过于隐式。

Method: 提出GB-DAL方法：1）使用原型粒球分割（PGBS）模块从有限数据集生成更密集的伪域；2）设计模拟非因果因子（SNF）模块进行对抗式数据增强，降低非因果因子的隐式性。

Result: 在多个基准上验证了GB-DAL相较现有方法具有更优的跨域泛化能力，尤其在新场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: GB-DAL通过细粒度域构造与显式非因果因子建模，有效提升了开放世界目标检测的域不变表征能力，为解决隐式非因果问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open world object detection faces a significant challenge in domain-invariant representation, i.e., implicit non-causal factors. Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL. Comparative experiments on numerous benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better generalization performance in novel circumstances.

*Chao Yin,Qing Han,Zhiwei Hou,Yue Liu,Anjin Dai,Hongda Hu,Ji Yang,Wei Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合空间上下文约束的损失函数改进方法（Boundary-CB和Density-CB），在严重类别不平衡（215:1）与几何歧义（尾部类与头部类共享圆柱体素）并存的工业点云分割任务中，显著提升安全关键部件（如减速器、阀门）的识别精度，且不损害头部类别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业数字孪生构建中，安全关键部件（如减速器、阀门）因数据极度稀少且局部几何与主流结构（如管道）高度相似，导致系统性误分类；现有基于频率的重加权方法无法解决几何歧义问题。

Method: 在Class-Balanced Loss框架基础上，引入两种即插即用的空间上下文约束机制：(1) Boundary-CB——基于熵的边界强调机制，聚焦歧义区域；(2) Density-CB——基于密度的补偿机制，缓解扫描密度差异影响；二者仅需替换损失函数，无需修改网络结构。

Result: 在Industrial3D数据集（6.1亿点）上，mIoU达55.74%，尾部类别相对提升21.7%（29.59% vs. 24.32%）；减速器IoU从0%提升至21.12%，阀门IoU相对提升24.3%；头部类别精度保持88.14%。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解耦统计不平衡与几何歧义双重挑战，在不牺牲头部类别性能前提下显著提升安全关键部件分割精度，为数字孪生中的自动化知识提取提供可靠基础。

Abstract: Industrial point cloud segmentation for Digital Twin construction faces a persistent challenge: safety-critical components such as reducers and valves are systematically misclassified. These failures stem from two compounding factors: such components are rare in training data, yet they share identical local geometry with dominant structures like pipes. This work identifies a dual crisis unique to industrial 3D data extreme class imbalance 215:1 ratio compounded by geometric ambiguity where most tail classes share cylindrical primitives with head classes. Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%). Components with primitive-sharing ambiguity show dramatic gains: reducer improves from 0% to 21.12% IoU; valve improves by 24.3% relative. This resolves geometric ambiguity without the typical head-tail trade-off, enabling reliable identification of safety-critical components for automated knowledge extraction in Digital Twin applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督语义感知的曝光校正网络，通过融合FastSAM语义信息与多尺度残差空间Mamba结构进行细节恢复，并利用CLIP引导生成伪真值及设计语义-提示一致性损失，以解决无真实标签和语义失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 曝光不当导致细节丢失、色彩失真和对比度下降；现有方法忽略物体级语义信息引发色彩偏移，且真实场景缺乏标注数据。

Method: 提出无监督语义感知曝光校正网络：1）自适应语义感知融合模块，将FastSAM提取的语义信息融入共享图像特征空间；2）多尺度残差空间Mamba组用于细节重建与曝光调整；3）CLIP微调生成伪真值；4）基于FastSAM和CLIP先验构建语义-提示一致性损失。

Result: 在真实世界曝光图像校正任务中，该方法在数值指标和视觉质量上均优于当前最优无监督方法。

Conclusion: 融合语义先验与大模型提示对齐的无监督框架可有效提升曝光校正性能，尤其在无标注、需保持语义一致性的场景下具有优势。

Abstract: Improper exposure often leads to severe loss of details, color distortion, and reduced contrast. Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually.

Abstract: Unlike conventional person re-identification (ReID), clothes-changing ReID (CC-ReID) presents severe challenges due to substantial appearance variations introduced by clothing changes. In this work, we propose the Quality-Aware Dual-Branch Matching (QA-ReID), which jointly leverages RGB-based features and parsing-based representations to model both global appearance and clothing-invariant structural cues. These heterogeneous features are adaptively fused through a multi-modal attention module. At the matching stage, we further design the Quality-Aware Query Adaptive Convolution (QAConv-QA), which incorporates pixel-level importance weighting and bidirectional consistency constraints to enhance robustness against clothing variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QA-ReID achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including PRCC, LTCC, and VC-Clothes, and significantly outperforms existing approaches under cross-clothing scenarios.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of retinal arteries and veins carries the diagnosis of systemic cardiovascular conditions. However, standard convolutional architectures often yield topologically disjointed segmentations, characterized by gaps and discontinuities that render reliable graph-based clinical analysis impossible despite high pixel-level accuracy. To address this, we introduce a topology-aware framework engineered to maintain vascular connectivity. Our architecture fuses a Topological Feature Fusion Module (TFFM) that maps local feature representations into a latent graph space, deploying Graph Attention Networks to capture global structural dependencies often missed by fixed receptive fields. Furthermore, we drive the learning process with a hybrid objective function, coupling Tversky loss for class imbalance with soft clDice loss to explicitly penalize topological disconnects. Evaluation on the Fundus-AVSeg dataset reveals state-of-the-art performance, achieving a combined Dice score of 90.97% and a 95% Hausdorff Distance of 3.50 pixels. Notably, our method decreases vessel fragmentation by approximately 38% relative to baselines, yielding topologically coherent vascular trees viable for automated biomarker quantification.

Motivation: 低照度图像超分辨率（LLSR）任务因低分辨率和光照不足的联合退化而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出Guided Texture and Feature Modulation Network（GTFMN），包含专门的Illumination Stream预测空间变化的光照图，并通过Illumination Guided Modulation Block（IGM Block）将该光照图作为显式引导，动态调制Texture Stream中的特征，实现空间自适应恢复。

Conclusion: GTFMN通过解耦与引导调制机制，有效提升了低照度图像超分辨率的性能，验证了其设计的有效性与先进性。

Abstract: Low-light image super-resolution (LLSR) is a challenging task due to the coupled degradation of low resolution and poor illumination. To address this, we propose the Guided Texture and Feature Modulation Network (GTFMN), a novel framework that decouples the LLSR task into two sub-problems: illumination estimation and texture restoration. First, our network employs a dedicated Illumination Stream whose purpose is to predict a spatially varying illumination map that accurately captures lighting distribution. Further, this map is utilized as an explicit guide within our novel Illumination Guided Modulation Block (IGM Block) to dynamically modulate features in the Texture Stream. This mechanism achieves spatially adaptive restoration, enabling the network to intensify enhancement in poorly lit regions while preserving details in well-exposed areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTFMN achieves the best performance among competing methods on the OmniNormal5 and OmniNormal15 datasets, outperforming them in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Abstract: Inversion-free image editing using flow-based generative models challenges the prevailing inversion-based pipelines. However, existing approaches rely on fixed Gaussian noise to construct the source trajectory, leading to biased trajectory dynamics and causing structural degradation or quality loss. To address this, we introduce SNR-Edit, a training-free framework achieving faithful Latent Trajectory Correction via adaptive noise control. Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion. Across SD3 and FLUX, evaluations on PIE-Bench and SNR-Bench show that SNR-Edit delivers performance on pixel-level metrics and VLM-based scoring, while adding only about 1s overhead per image.

### [27] [Contrastive Spectral Rectification: Test-Time Defense towards Zero-shot Adversarial Robustness of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19210)
*Sen Nie,Jie Zhang,Zhuo Wang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR)的测试时防御方法，利用视觉语言模型在频谱上的固有偏差，通过频谱引导的对比目标优化输入校正扰动，显著提升对抗鲁棒性且开销较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs（如CLIP）虽具零样本泛化能力，但易受对抗样本攻击；当前测试时防御方法鲁棒性不足、推理延迟高、任务适配性差。

Method: 基于对抗样本在渐进频率衰减下特征不一致的现象及其与模型谱偏置的关联，提出CSR方法：在测试时自适应地施加频谱引导的对比学习目标，优化输入校正扰动以对齐自然流形。

Result: 在16个分类基准上，CSR在强AutoAttack下平均提升SOTA鲁棒性18.1%，推理开销小，并可泛化至多种视觉任务。

Conclusion: CSR是一种高效、通用、鲁棒的测试时防御方法，揭示并利用了VLMs的谱偏置特性，为提升多模态模型安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, yet remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Summu77/CSR.

*Fuxiang Sun,Xi Jiang,Jiansheng Wu,Haigang Zhang,Feng Zheng,Jinfeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个面向印刷电路板（PCB）质量检测的统一视觉-语言基准UniPCB及专用多模态大模型PCB-GPT，显著提升了细粒度缺陷定位与分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂工业质检（如PCB检测）中表现不足，且缺乏高质量、统一的视觉-语言评测基准，主因是数据稀缺、来源分散与标注标准不一。

Method: 构建了系统化数据整理与标准化流程，整合多源数据形成UniPCB基准；基于该流程生成指令数据，并设计模仿人类专家学习过程的渐进式课程训练PCB-GPT。

Result: 在UniPCB上评估显示，PCB-GPT在细粒度缺陷定位任务上性能较最强基线提升超两倍，在定位与分析能力上具有显著优势。

Conclusion: UniPCB和PCB-GPT填补了PCB质检领域统一评测与专用模型的空白，为工业多模态智能质检提供了新基准与可行路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for general industrial quality inspection, but fall short in complex scenarios, such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) inspection. PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: SimpleSeg提出了一种简单而高效的方法，将分割任务转化为文本坐标序列生成问题，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）原生语言空间直接预测物体边界点，通过SF→RL两阶段训练提升精度，在分割基准上媲美甚至超越复杂专用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常依赖复杂、任务特定的架构或辅助组件来实现像素级感知，而本文旨在探索标准MLLM是否具备被激发的内在低层感知能力，从而实现更统一、简洁的视觉-语言模型设计。

Method: 将分割建模为纯文本序列生成任务，即预测描述物体边界的点坐标序列；提出SF→RL两阶段训练流程：先监督微调（SF），再以IoU为奖励进行强化学习（RL）优化点序列与真实轮廓的一致性；不修改MLLM原始架构。

Result: 在多个分割基准上达到与复杂专用方法相当甚至更优的性能，验证了标准MLLM具备可被解锁的强低层感知能力。

Conclusion: 精确的空间理解可通过简单的点序列预测自然涌现，无需额外模块或架构改动，挑战了当前对辅助组件的依赖，推动VLM向更统一、原生支持像素级任务的方向发展。

Abstract: We present SimpleSeg, a strikingly simple yet highly effective approach to endow Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with native pixel-level perception. Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了视频连接（Video Connecting）这一新任务，旨在生成给定起始与结束视频片段之间的平滑过渡内容，并构建了首个专用基准VC-Bench，包含1579个高质量视频及三类评估指标（VQS、SECS、TSS），揭示现有视频生成模型在一致性与过渡平滑性上的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用（如视频编辑、vlog）需要将分离的视频片段无缝连接，但当前视频生成研究主要聚焦于文本或图像条件，缺乏针对视频连接任务的标准化评估基准。

Method: 提出视频连接新任务；构建首个专用基准VC-Bench，涵盖1579个跨15大类、72子类的高质量视频；设计三维度评估指标：视频质量分数（VQS）、起止一致性分数（SECS）和过渡平滑度分数（TSS）。

Result: 在VC-Bench上评测多个SOTA视频生成模型，发现其在起止一致性和过渡平滑性方面存在显著缺陷，导致整体连贯性与流畅性不足。

Conclusion: VC-Bench是视频连接领域的首个系统性基准，有望推动该方向的方法创新与评估标准化，相关数据与指标已开源。

Abstract: While current video generation focuses on text or image conditions, practical applications like video editing and vlogging often need to seamlessly connect separate clips. In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity. We expect that VC-Bench will serve as a pioneering benchmark to inspire and guide future research in video connecting. The evaluation metrics and dataset are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VC-Bench-1B67/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了TIGaussian框架，利用3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）特性，通过多分支3DGS分词器和模态特定的3D特征对齐策略，提升文本、图像与3D数据之间的跨模态对齐性能，在跨模态检索、零样本分类等任务中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型虽已实现文本与图像的强关联，但引入3D模态（如点云、3D高斯）仍面临3D特征提取困难及跨模态语义鸿沟问题，亟需更有效的3D表征与对齐方法。

Method: 提出TIGaussian框架：1）多分支3DGS分词器，将3DGS内在属性解耦为紧凑潜在表示；2）双向跨模态对齐策略——含基于扩散先验的多视角特征融合机制（解决图像-3D视角歧义），以及文本-3D投影模块（自适应映射3D特征至文本嵌入空间）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的大量实验表明，TIGaussian在跨模态检索、零样本分类和场景识别等任务中均取得当前最优性能（state-of-the-art）。

Conclusion: TIGaussian有效克服了3D模态建模与跨模态对齐的关键挑战，验证了基于3D高斯泼溅的紧凑表征与分层对齐策略在多模态大模型中的可行性与优越性。

Abstract: While visual-language models have profoundly linked features between texts and images, the incorporation of 3D modality data, such as point clouds and 3D Gaussians, further enables pretraining for 3D-related tasks, e.g., cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot classification, and scene recognition. As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TIGaussian in multiple tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型快速发展导致高度逼真的合成图像泛滥，威胁数字媒体的真实性与可信度；亟需可靠检测方法，而手工特征因其可解释性、高效性和泛化性仍具吸引力。

Method: 在CIFAKE数据集上系统评估七种手工特征（像素、颜色直方图、DCT、HOG、LBP、GLCM、小波），并使用七种分类器（从逻辑回归到LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost）进行基准测试，对比三种特征配置（基线、高级、混合）。

Result: LightGBM结合混合特征取得最优性能：PR-AUC 0.9879，ROC-AUC 0.9878，F1 0.9447，Brier分数0.0414；性能随特征组合复杂度提升而单调增强。

Conclusion: 精心设计的手工特征与梯度提升集成方法（尤其是LightGBM）在合成图像检测中仍具强大竞争力，尤其适用于强调可解释性与计算效率的应用场景。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising concerns about authenticity and trust in digital media. Detecting such fake content reliably is an urgent challenge. While deep learning approaches dominate current literature, handcrafted features remain attractive for their interpretability, efficiency, and generalizability. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit. These findings highlight the continued relevance of carefully engineered features and ensemble learning for detecting synthetic images, particularly in contexts where interpretability and computational efficiency are critical.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多视角一致性框架用于半监督域自适应（SSDA），通过去偏策略校正类别预测概率、利用伪负样本标签，以及跨域亲和学习对齐同类特征，显著提升了DomainNet和Office-Home上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标域标注样本有限，易导致模型预测偏差，即使源域数据平衡也无法避免特征空间中类间内在相似性带来的问题。

Method: 提出多视角一致性框架：1）基于模型预测性能的类别级去偏策略；2）利用模型预测生成伪负样本标签；3）跨域亲和学习以对齐同类别在不同域中的特征表示。

Result: 在DomainNet和Office-Home两个标准域自适应数据集上，性能优于现有竞争方法。

Conclusion: 融合无监督域自适应与半监督学习可有效提升模型泛化能力、降低标注成本，在工业应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) leverages knowledge from a fully labeled source domain to classify data in a partially labeled target domain. Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-domain affinity learning aimed at aligning features of the same class across different domains, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods on two standard domain adaptation datasets, DomainNet and Office-Home. Combining unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning offers indispensable contributions to the industrial sector by enhancing model adaptability, reducing annotation costs, and improving performance.

Abstract: Pro-Mist filters are widely used in cinematography for their ability to create soft halation, lower contrast, and produce a distinctive, atmospheric style. These effects are difficult to reproduce digitally due to the complex behavior of light diffusion. We present ProMist-5K, a dataset designed to support cinematic style emulation. It is built using a physically inspired pipeline in a scene-referred linear space and includes 20,000 high-resolution image pairs across four configurations, covering two filter densities (1/2 and 1/8) and two focal lengths (20mm and 50mm). Unlike general style datasets, ProMist-5K focuses on realistic glow and highlight diffusion effects. Multiple blur layers and carefully tuned weighting are used to model the varying intensity and spread of optical diffusion. The dataset provides a consistent and controllable target domain that supports various image translation models and learning paradigms. Experiments show that the dataset works well across different training settings and helps capture both subtle and strong cinematic appearances. ProMist-5K offers a practical and physically grounded resource for film-inspired image transformation, bridging the gap between digital flexibility and traditional lens aesthetics.

ASFW offers photorealistic shadow variations and accurate ground truths, bridging the gap between synthetic and real domains. Deep models trained on ASFW demonstrate improved shadow removal in real-world conditions. We also introduce the Face Shadow Eraser (FSE) method to showcase the effectiveness of the dataset. Experiments demonstrate that ASFW enhances the performance of facial shadow removal models, setting new standards for this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的雷达-相机融合框架，通过InstaRadar增强雷达密度与语义对齐，并将预训练RCDPT模块嵌入BEVDepth中提升单目3D目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D检测存在深度模糊和鲁棒性差的问题；雷达虽具环境鲁棒性但稀疏低分辨率，需更有效的雷达-相机融合与深度估计策略。

Method: 1) InstaRadar：基于实例分割掩码引导的雷达点云扩展方法，提升雷达密度与语义对齐；2) 将预训练RCDPT模型替代BEVDepth中的深度模块，利用InstaRadar增强输入进行端到端训练。

Result: InstaRadar在雷达引导的深度估计任务中达到SOTA；整体框架在BEVDepth基线上实现稳定性能增益；但相比直接提取BEV特征的雷达-相机融合模型仍有差距。

Conclusion: InstaRadar与显式深度监督对单目3D检测有效；当前雷达仅作深度引导而非独立特征流，未来可拓展为类点云表示并引入时序雷达分支以增强BEV融合。

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.

Abstract: We present Innovator-VL, a scientific multimodal large language model designed to advance understanding and reasoning across diverse scientific domains while maintaining excellent performance on general vision tasks. Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling. (iii) Third, Innovator-VL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving competitive performance on general vision, multimodal reasoning, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific alignment can be integrated into a unified model without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Our practices suggest that efficient, reproducible, and high-performing scientific multimodal models can be built even without large-scale data, providing a practical foundation for future research.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了八种立体匹配方法在植被密集环境中的零样本深度估计性能，提出了首个专门针对树木枝条场景的Canterbury Tree Branches数据集，并发现DEFOM模型在跨域一致性上表现最佳，可作为未来基准测试的伪真值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度估计方法的评估主要集中在城市和室内场景，缺乏对植被密集环境（如森林）的鲁棒性和跨域泛化能力验证，制约了自主无人机林业作业的发展。

Method: 对八种代表性立体深度估计方法（包括迭代优化、基础模型、扩散模型和3D CNN）进行零样本迁移评估，全部使用Scene Flow预训练权重，在ETH3D、KITTI 2012/2015、Middlebury及新构建的5313对Canterbury Tree Branches数据集上统一测试。

Result: 发现不同方法性能具有场景依赖性：基础模型（如DEFOM）在结构化场景中表现优异（ETH3D上0.23 px，Middlebury上4.65 px），而迭代方法（如IGEV++）跨基准波动大；DEFOM在Tree Branches数据集上表现最优且跨基准排名最稳定（平均排名1.75），被确立为植被深度估计的新基线。

Conclusion: DEFOM展现出最强的跨域一致性与植被深度估计能力，其预测结果可作为后续研究的伪地面真值；本工作填补了林业场景深度估计评估的空白，并为无人机自主作业提供了可靠基准。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75).

*Jinming Zhang,Xi Yang,Youpeng Yang,Haosen Shi,Yuyao Yan,Qiufeng Wang,Guangliang Cheng,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种区域感知的课程学习策略与Pareto一致损失函数，结合模糊标注机制，以应对医学图像分割中边界区域不确定性高、训练不稳定的问题，显著提升了肿瘤亚区分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中边界区域不确定性远高于内部区域，而传统训练对所有像素一视同仁，导致早期预测不可靠时优化不稳定，阻碍模型收敛至Pareto最优解。

Method: 提出区域-wise课程学习策略，优先学习确定性高的区域；设计Pareto-consistent损失函数，自适应重塑损失曲面并约束内外区域的收敛动态；引入模糊标注机制，在非边界区保持二值置信度，在边界区实现平滑过渡，稳定梯度并扩展损失曲面平坦区域。

Result: 在脑转移瘤与非转移性肿瘤分割任务上，该方法在多个配置下均取得一致提升，且在所有肿瘤亚区上均优于传统明确集（crisp-set）方法。

Conclusion: 区域感知课程学习、Pareto一致损失与模糊标注三者协同，有效缓解了不确定性驱动的训练不稳定性，引导模型更稳健地逼近Pareto最优分割解。

Abstract: Uncertainty in medical image segmentation is inherently non-uniform, with boundary regions exhibiting substantially higher ambiguity than interior areas. Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions.

Abstract: Accessing high-quality, open-access dermatopathology image datasets for learning and cross-referencing is a common challenge for clinicians and dermatopathology trainees. To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6\% for the deep learning approach, 61.0\% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4\% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists. Using our dataset as a challenging task, we found the current image analysis algorithm from OpenAI inadequate for analyzing dermatopathology images. In conclusion, we have developed a large, peer-reviewed, open-access dermatopathology image dataset, DermpathNet, which features a semi-automated curation workflow.

TL;DR: 本文提出X-AIGD细粒度可解释AI生成图像检测基准，提供像素级、分类化的感知伪影标注（低/高/认知层），揭示现有检测器几乎不依赖伪影、仍依赖不可解释特征，并验证对齐模型注意力与伪影区域可提升可解释性与泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AIGI检测方法多为二分类，缺乏可解释证据；现有基准覆盖伪影多样性不足且无细粒度局部标注，难以支撑可解释性评估。

Method: 构建X-AIGD基准，包含像素级、多层级（低层失真、高层语义、认知层反事实）感知伪影标注；基于该基准系统分析现有检测器的行为机制，并探索注意力对齐等可解释性增强策略。

Result: 发现：(1) 现有检测器几乎不依赖各类感知伪影；(2) 即使训练识别特定伪影，仍严重依赖不可解释特征；(3) 显式对齐模型注意力与伪影区域可提升可解释性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: X-AIGD为可解释AIGI检测提供了新基准与分析范式，指出提升可解释性的关键路径在于显式建模与利用感知伪影，而非仅依赖黑箱统计特征。

Abstract: Current AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detection approaches predominantly rely on binary classification to distinguish real from synthetic images, often lacking interpretable or convincing evidence to substantiate their decisions. This limitation stems from existing AIGI detection benchmarks, which, despite featuring a broad collection of synthetic images, remain restricted in their coverage of artifact diversity and lack detailed, localized annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level. (2) While AIGI detectors can be trained to identify specific artifacts, they still substantially base their judgment on uninterpretable features. (3) Explicitly aligning model attention with artifact regions can increase the interpretability and generalization of detectors. The data and code are available at: https://github.com/Coxy7/X-AIGD.

Motivation: 现有文本生成3D场景方法存在空间感知缺失、依赖预设相机路径、无法理解语义布局及处理运动导致的遮挡空洞等问题。

Method: 1）利用视觉语言模型构建场景图以编码物体语义关系，并指导自适应相机漫游轨迹规划；2）提出运动注入式Inpainting模型，在合成全景数据集上微调，适配真实相机运动。

Result: 在多个指标上显著超越SOTA方法，生成更一致、更逼真的3D场景；代码已开源。

Conclusion: RoamScene3D成功融合语义推理与几何约束，有效提升了文本驱动3D场景生成的空间一致性与内容完整性。

Abstract: Generating immersive 3D scenes from texts is a core task in computer vision, crucial for applications in virtual reality and game development. Despite the promise of leveraging 2D diffusion priors, existing methods suffer from spatial blindness and rely on predefined trajectories that fail to exploit the inner relationships among salient objects. Consequently, these approaches are unable to comprehend the semantic layout, preventing them from exploring the scene adaptively to infer occluded content. Moreover, current inpainting models operate in 2D image space, struggling to plausibly fill holes caused by camera motion. To address these limitations, we propose RoamScene3D, a novel framework that bridges the gap between semantic guidance and spatial generation. Our method reasons about the semantic relations among objects and produces consistent and photorealistic scenes. Specifically, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to construct a scene graph that encodes object relations, guiding the camera to perceive salient object boundaries and plan an adaptive roaming trajectory. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitations of static 2D priors, we introduce a Motion-Injected Inpainting model that is fine-tuned on a synthetic panoramic dataset integrating authentic camera trajectories, making it adaptive to camera motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with semantic reasoning and geometric constraints, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in producing consistent and photorealistic scenes.

Abstract: We present VGGT-SLAM 2.0, a real time RGB feed-forward SLAM system which substantially improves upon VGGT-SLAM for incrementally aligning submaps created from VGGT. Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: PSFH分割对产程监测至关重要，但受超声图像类别不平衡、边界模糊、噪声干扰及高质量标注数据稀缺等挑战限制；现有方法多依赖CNN或Transformer，未充分挖掘更强大模型（如SAM）的潜力。

Method: 提出Dual-Student and Teacher框架（DSTCS），融合CNN与Segment Anything Model（SAM）分支，引入二者协同学习机制；设计面向边界的专用数据增强策略和新型损失函数。

Result: 在MICCAI 2023和2024 PSFH分割基准上实验表明，该方法鲁棒性更强，分割精度显著超越现有技术。

Conclusion: DSTCS为临床PSFH分割提供了高精度、高鲁棒性的可靠工具，验证了将SAM融入医学图像分割教师-学生范式的有效性与优势。

Abstract: Segmentation of the pubic symphysis and fetal head (PSFH) is a critical procedure in intrapartum monitoring and is essential for evaluating labor progression and identifying potential delivery complications. However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice.

Motivation: 现实世界中的场景是持续动态变化的，而现有方法将场景视为静态，与实际不符，因此需要能感知并适应动态环境的人-场景交互生成方法。

Abstract: Scenes are continuously undergoing dynamic changes in the real world. However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings.

*Yizhao Han,Tianxing Shi,Zhao Wang,Zifan Xu,Zhiyuan Pu,Mingxiao Li,Qian Zhang,Wei Yin,Xiao-Xiao Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种熵引导的k-Guard（ENkG）采样策略，用于改善视频生成中自回归模型的采样效果，通过根据每个token预测分布的熵自适应调整候选集大小，从而提升长时序视频生成的质量和结构稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在LLM中有效的静态top-k/top-p采样策略在视频生成中表现不佳，因视频token语义密度低、时空冗余高，导致静态策略在低不确定性区域引入噪声，在高不确定性区域易累积错误。

Method: 提出Entropy-Guided k-Guard（ENkG）采样策略：基于每个token预测分布的熵动态调整候选token数量——低熵区域减少候选数以抑制噪声、保持结构；高熵区域增加候选数以缓解误差累积。该方法无需训练、模型无关、开销极小。

Result: 实验表明ENkG在感知质量和结构稳定性上持续优于静态top-k/top-p策略。

Conclusion: ENkG是一种简单、通用且高效的视频自回归生成采样策略，有效缓解了长时序视频生成中的误差累积问题。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved significant successes in LLMs, inspiring explorations for video generation. In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS快速重建挑战中严苛的一分钟时间限制，以及SLAM位姿噪声大、COLMAP位姿精度高但优化特性不同的异构输入问题，需兼顾速度与重建质量。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：第一阶段面向SLAM位姿，引入反向逐高斯并行优化、紧凑前向泼溅、负载均衡分块、锚点式Neural-Gaussian表示、单目深度+前馈3DGS初始化、全局位姿精修；第二阶段面向COLMAP位姿，关闭位姿优化、回归标准3DGS、引入多视角一致性引导的高斯分裂、增加深度估计器监督渲染深度。

Conclusion: 所提两阶段自适应框架能有效平衡效率与精度，验证了针对不同位姿质量定制化优化策略对极限实时3DGS重建的关键作用。

Abstract: We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition.

Motivation: 解决现有生成模型依赖弱条件信号（如标签或文本）、缺乏解剖学基础、易产生生物学上不合理的输出等问题，同时缓解真实神经影像数据中罕见表型稀缺、跨设备域偏移和纵向覆盖不足等瓶颈。

Result: 在图像质量、皮层表面重建和全脑分割质量等多方面验证中，Cor2Vox优于多种基线方法；在解剖一致性合成、进行性灰质萎缩模拟及FTD数据集标准化三个应用中，均实现亚体素级皮层形态保持，并对皮层几何与疾病表型变化表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Cor2Vox是一种 cortex-grounded 的新型MRI合成方法，通过将生成过程与连续皮层结构先验紧密耦合，显著提升了合成图像的解剖合理性、可控性与泛化能力，无需重训练即可适应多种临床与研究场景。

Abstract: Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.

TL;DR: 本文提出Pref-Restore，一种结合离散语义逻辑与连续纹理生成的分层盲脸恢复框架，通过增强输入密度和剪枝输出分布来缓解信息不对称问题，实现确定性、偏好对齐的高质量人脸重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲脸恢复因输入信息严重不足与输出信息高度密集之间的信息不对称（one-to-many映射）而面临不确定性与幻觉伪影问题。

Method: 提出Pref-Restore框架：(1) 使用自回归整合器将文本指令转为稠密潜在查询以增强输入语义约束；(2) 在扩散恢复过程中嵌入on-policy强化学习，将人类偏好转化为可微约束以抑制随机偏差。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上达到SOTA性能；实证表明该方法显著降低解空间熵，提升恢复结果的确定性与可靠性。

Conclusion: Pref-Restore通过语义引导与偏好驱动的联合优化，为盲脸恢复提供了更可靠、确定性的新范式。

Abstract: Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.

Abstract: Predicting the status of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) from objective, non-invasive methods is an active research field. Yet, extracting automatically objective, interpretable features for a detailed analysis of the patient state remains largely unexplored.
  Among MDD's symptoms, Psychomotor retardation (PMR) is a core item, yet its clinical assessment remains largely subjective. While 3D motion capture offers an objective alternative, its reliance on specialized hardware often precludes routine clinical use. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive computational framework that transforms monocular RGB video into clinically relevant 3D gait kinematics. Our pipeline uses Gravity-View Coordinates along with a novel trajectory-correction algorithm that leverages the closed-loop topology of our adapted Timed Up and Go (TUG) protocol to mitigate monocular depth errors. This novel pipeline enables the extraction of 297 explicit gait biomechanical biomarkers from a single camera capture.
  To address the challenges of small clinical datasets, we introduce a stability-based machine learning framework that identifies robust motor signatures while preventing overfitting. Validated on the CALYPSO dataset, our method achieves an 83.3% accuracy in detecting PMR and explains 64% of the variance in overall depression severity (R^2=0.64). Notably, our study reveals a strong link between reduced ankle propulsion and restricted pelvic mobility to the depressive motor phenotype. These results demonstrate that physical movement serves as a robust proxy for the cognitive state, offering a transparent and scalable tool for the objective monitoring of depression in standard clinical environments.

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG) aims to translate written texts into expressive sign motions, bridging communication barriers for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%. Code and models will be released on our project page.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D human motion capture from videos remains a challenge in computer vision. Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST. The code is available at https://github.com/cuongle1206/QuaMo

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于StyleGAN2的局部潜在编辑框架，用于模拟肉毒毒素注射效果并辅助剂量规划，通过区域特异性潜在轴发现方法实现面部局部肌肉放松的精准建模，并结合临床数据构建剂量-响应预测模型，辅以人机协同工作流提升临床实用性。


<details>

Motivation: 肉毒毒素注射虽为面部不对称矫正和美学抗衰的金标准，但剂量选择依赖经验直觉，常导致效果不佳，亟需可解释、可量化的注射规划工具。

Method: 提出区域特异性潜在轴发现方法，在StyleGAN2隐空间中学习面部局部肌肉放松轨迹；将隐轨迹与实际注射单位关联，构建剂量-响应预测模型；对比直接指标回归与图像生成模拟两种范式；引入人机协同交互优化流程。

Abstract: Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections are the gold standard for managing facial asymmetry and aesthetic rejuvenation, yet determining the optimal dosage remains largely intuitive, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. We propose a localized latent editing framework that simulates Botulinum Toxin injection effects for injection planning through dose-response modeling. Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes. While biological variability limits absolute precision, we introduce a hybrid "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow where clinicians interactively refine simulations, bridging the gap between pathological reconstruction and cosmetic planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GMS-CAVP框架，通过多尺度视频-音频对齐与多尺度时空扩散预训练目标，提升视频-音频跨模态建模能力，在生成与检索任务上均优于现有方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CAVP）在建模视频与音频信号间密集、多尺度的语义和时序对应关系方面存在不足，尤其未能充分利用从细粒度到粗粒度的空间-时间结构。

Method: 提出GMS-CAVP框架：1）采用多尺度对比学习策略，建模不同粒度下的语义与时间关系；2）引入基于扩散模型的生成式目标，支持视频与音频之间的跨模态翻译与合成，构建判别-生成统一范式。

Result: 在VGGSound、AudioSet和Panda70M数据集上的大量实验表明，GMS-CAVP在视频-音频生成与跨模态检索任务上均显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 多尺度建模与扩散生成目标的结合能更全面地捕捉视频-音频间的复杂对应关系，推动跨模态理解与高保真生成协同发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了不同初始化策略对差分隐私（DP）下医学影像分析性能的影响，发现域特定监督预训练（如MIMIC-CXR）效果最优，自监督DINOv3初始化优于ImageNet初始化但次之，且初始化显著影响公平性、泛化性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私虽能保护敏感数据，但常导致诊断性能大幅下降；模型初始化被证实是缓解该问题的关键因素，但现代自监督学习在全模型差分隐私下的作用尚不明确。

Method: 在超80万张胸部X光片上，采用DP-SGD训练先进ConvNeXt模型，对比三种初始化：ImageNet监督初始化、DINOv3自监督初始化、MIMIC-CXR域内监督初始化；在五个外部异构数据集上评估诊断性能、公平性、泛化性与鲁棒性。

Result: DINOv3初始化在DP下持续优于ImageNet初始化，但仍不如MIMIC-CXR域内监督初始化（其性能最接近非隐私基线）；初始化选择显著影响人口统计公平性、跨数据集泛化能力及对数据规模和模型容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 初始化策略是决定差分隐私医学影像分析中效用、公平性与泛化能力的核心因素，域内监督预训练仍是当前最优选择。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides formal protection for sensitive data but typically incurs substantial losses in diagnostic performance. Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints. The results establish initialization strategy as a central determinant of utility, fairness, and generalization in differentially private medical imaging.

Conclusion: 本工作为面向管理意识的低空视觉-语言系统研究提供了新视角和基础支撑。

Abstract: Low-altitude vision systems are becoming a critical infrastructure for smart city governance. However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components. We believe our work offers a new perspective and foundation for future studies on management-aware low-altitude vision-language systems.

Result: 理论与实验验证KeepLoRA能有效平衡三项目标，并达到当前最优性能。

Conclusion: KeepLoRA是一种简单而有效的持续学习方法，显著提升了预训练视觉语言模型在多任务序列学习中的稳定性与适应性。

Abstract: Continual learning for pre-trained vision-language models requires balancing three competing objectives: retaining pre-trained knowledge, preserving knowledge from a sequence of learned tasks, and maintaining the plasticity to acquire new knowledge. This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features. Our theoretical and empirical analyses confirm that KeepLoRA balances the three objectives and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MaolinLuo/KeepLoRA.

Motivation: 现有图像相似度指标非感知导向，尤其在存在纹理失真时表现不佳。

Method: 构建双项感知度量：1）用Earth Mover's Distance衡量两图纹理差异；2）在Oklab感知颜色空间中衡量色度差异；并提供可视化解释。

Conclusion: 所提双项感知度量兼具高精度与可解释性，是面向复杂失真的图像相似性评估的有效新方案。

Abstract: In the literature, several studies have shown that state-of-the-art image similarity metrics are not perceptual metrics; moreover, they have difficulty evaluating images, especially when texture distortion is also present. In this work, we propose a new perceptual metric composed of two terms. The first term evaluates the dissimilarity between the textures of two images using Earth Mover's Distance. The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors. We have shown that our metric outperforms the state of the art, especially when images contain shape distortions, confirming also its greater perceptiveness. Furthermore, although deep black-box metrics could be very accurate, they only provide similarity scores between two images, without explaining their main differences and similarities. Our metric, on the other hand, provides visual explanations to support the calculated score, making the similarity assessment transparent and justified.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SharpNet，一种改进的MLP架构，通过引入求解具有跳跃Neumann边界条件的泊松方程的辅助特征函数，实现对具有用户指定C⁰尖锐特征（如边缘、角点）的函数的精确建模，同时保证特征处C⁰连续、其余区域光滑，并支持端到端联合优化特征位置与网络参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP输出全局光滑，难以自然表示具有预设C⁰尖锐特征（如不连续梯度）的连续函数，常需后处理，缺乏对不光滑性的显式建模能力。

Method: 提出SharpNet：在标准MLP基础上引入一个由泊松方程（带跳跃Neumann边界条件）定义的辅助特征函数；该函数通过高效、完全可微的局部积分进行评估，从而支持对特征位置和MLP参数的联合优化；理论保证C⁰连续性在特征处精确可控。

Result: 在2D函数拟合和3D CAD模型重建任务上，SharpNet能准确恢复尖锐边缘与角点，同时保持远离特征区域的光滑性；定量与定性结果均优于现有SOTA方法，后者普遍平滑掉梯度不连续性。

Conclusion: SharpNet为隐式几何表示与函数逼近提供了一种原理清晰、可微、可控的新范式，首次将偏微分方程约束显式嵌入神经网络结构中以实现定制化不光滑性建模。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a standard tool for learning and function approximation, but they inherently yield outputs that are globally smooth. As a result, they struggle to represent functions that are continuous yet deliberately non-differentiable (i.e., with prescribed $C^0$ sharp features) without relying on ad hoc post-processing. We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations highlight the benefits of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频推理方法依赖粗粒度序列级奖励或单因素token选择，忽视视觉输入、时间动态与语言输出之间的细粒度关联，导致准确性和可解释性受限。

Method: 提出Video-KTR框架，基于三种归因信号进行token级强化学习：(1) 通过反事实掩码识别视觉感知型token；(2) 通过帧打乱检测时间敏感型token；(3) 基于高熵识别预测不确定性token；仅对这三类关键token进行策略更新。

Result: 在五个挑战性基准上达到SOTA或极具竞争力的结果，如在Video-Holmes上达42.7%，超越GPT-4o；消融实验验证三类信号的互补性及token级更新的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Video-KTR提升了视频推理的准确性与可解释性，是一种简单、即插即用的RL增强方案，适用于复杂视频推理任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong potential for enhancing reasoning in multimodal large language models, yet existing video reasoning methods often rely on coarse sequence-level rewards or single-factor token selection, neglecting fine-grained links among visual inputs, temporal dynamics, and linguistic outputs, limiting both accuracy and interpretability. We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates. Overall, Video-KTR improves accuracy and interpretability, offering a simple, drop-in extension to RL for complex video reasoning.

Abstract: Vision Mamba models have been extensively researched in various fields, which address the limitations of previous models by effectively managing long-range dependencies with a linear-time overhead. Several prospective studies have further designed Vision Mamba based on UNet(VM-UNet) for medical image segmentation. These approaches primarily focus on optimizing architectural designs by creating more complex structures to enhance the model's ability to perceive semantic features. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the model by Dual Self-distillation for VM-UNet (DSVM-UNet) without any complex architectural designs. To achieve this goal, we develop double self-distillation methods to align the features at both the global and local levels. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISIC2017, ISIC2018, and Synapse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Yucheng Xie,Fu Feng,Ruixiao Shi,Jing Wang,Yong Rui,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SWEET框架，通过基于Tucker分解的约束式自监督预训练，学习共享权重模板与尺寸特定的权重缩放器，实现对不同规模视觉模型的灵活、高效初始化，并引入宽度方向随机缩放以提升跨宽度泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代模型参数规模和复杂度不断增大，但实际部署常需不同尺寸的架构，而传统预训练与微调方法难以有效支持这种可变规模需求。

Method: 提出SWEET自监督框架：1）采用Tucker分解建模，联合学习共享权重模板与尺寸特定的轻量级权重缩放器；2）通过模板与缩放器组合完成目标模型初始化；3）引入宽度方向随机缩放（width-wise stochastic scaling）正则化模板，增强宽度不变表征能力。

Result: 在分类、检测、分割和生成等多类视觉任务上，SWEET在初始化可变尺寸模型时取得当前最优性能。

Conclusion: SWEET提供了一种模块化、可扩展的预训练范式，显著提升了预训练模型对不同深度与宽度架构的适应性与泛化能力。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of modern model parameters underscore the importance of pre-trained models. However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization. Extensive experiments on \textsc{classification}, \textsc{detection}, \textsc{segmentation} and \textsc{generation} tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SWEET for initializing variable-sized vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了DiffStyle3D，一种基于扩散模型的3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）风格迁移新范式，通过在潜在空间中直接优化，并引入注意力感知损失与几何引导的多视角一致性方法，显著提升了风格迁移质量与多视角一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VGG/CLIP的方法难以建模多视角一致性，而扩散方法虽能捕获一致性但依赖去噪方向、训练不稳定。

Method: 提出DiffStyle3D：1）在潜在空间直接优化；2）Attention-Aware Loss，在自注意力空间对齐风格与内容特征；3）Geometry-Guided Multi-View Consistency，将几何信息融入自注意力以建模跨视角对应；4）构建几何感知掩码抑制重叠区域冗余优化。

Result: 在多个指标和视觉效果上超越SOTA方法，显著提升风格化质量与多视角一致性及视觉真实性。

Conclusion: DiffStyle3D通过结合注意力机制与几何先验，在扩散框架下实现了稳定、高质量、多视角一致的3D风格迁移，为3D内容生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D style transfer enables the creation of visually expressive 3D content, enriching the visual appearance of 3D scenes and objects. However, existing VGG- and CLIP-based methods struggle to model multi-view consistency within the model itself, while diffusion-based approaches can capture such consistency but rely on denoising directions, leading to unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle3D, a novel diffusion-based paradigm for 3DGS style transfer that directly optimizes in the latent space. Specifically, we introduce an Attention-Aware Loss that performs style transfer by aligning style features in the self-attention space, while preserving original content through content feature alignment. Inspired by the geometric invariance of 3D stylization, we propose a Geometry-Guided Multi-View Consistency method that integrates geometric information into self-attention to enable cross-view correspondence modeling. Based on geometric information, we additionally construct a geometry-aware mask to prevent redundant optimization in overlapping regions across views, which further improves multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show that DiffStyle3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher stylization quality and visual realism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了WaterClear-GS，首个纯3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）框架，将水下光学特性（如局部衰减与散射）直接嵌入高斯基元中，无需辅助介质网络；通过双分支优化、深度引导几何正则化与多种物理引导损失，实现实时高质量水下新视角合成与外观恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF的方法渲染慢、色彩恢复不佳，而3DGS本身难以建模水下复杂的体散射效应，亟需一种兼顾效率、物理可解释性与视觉保真度的端到端水下重建方法。

Method: 提出WaterClear-GS：将水下局部衰减与散射建模显式编码进3D高斯基元；采用双分支优化策略保障光度一致性并恢复无水外观；引入深度引导几何正则化、感知驱动图像损失、曝光约束、空间自适应正则化和物理引导光谱正则化。

Result: 在标准基准及自建数据集上，WaterClear-GS在新视角合成（NVS）与水下图像恢复（UIR）任务中均达SOTA性能，同时支持实时渲染。

Conclusion: WaterClear-GS首次成功将水下光学先验深度融合进3DGS框架，在保持高效渲染的同时显著提升水下场景的几何与外观重建质量，为真实水下三维理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Underwater 3D reconstruction and appearance restoration are hindered by the complex optical properties of water, such as wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods struggle with slow rendering speeds and suboptimal color restoration, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) inherently lacks the capability to model complex volumetric scattering effects. To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that WaterClear-GS achieves outstanding performance on both novel view synthesis (NVS) and underwater image restoration (UIR) tasks, while maintaining real-time rendering. The code will be available at https://buaaxrzhang.github.io/WaterClear-GS/.

TL;DR: PaW-ViT是一种基于解剖学知识的预处理方法，通过将耳部图像归一化并对齐token边界与耳部特征边界，提升ViT在耳部生物识别中的鲁棒性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决耳部生物特征形态变异与Transformer架构位置敏感性之间的不匹配问题，克服矩形token引入无关区域信息导致的性能下降。

Method: 提出Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer（PaW-ViT），利用解剖学先验对耳部图像进行归一化，并将token边界精准对齐到检测出的耳部特征边界及自然曲率上。

Result: 在多种ViT模型（ViT-T/S/B/L）上验证有效，显著提升对耳部形状、尺寸和姿态变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PaW-ViT弥合了生物形态多样性与Transformer结构限制之间的鸿沟，为耳部身份认证提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rectangular tokens common to vision transformer methods for visual recognition can strongly affect performance of these methods due to incorporation of information outside the objects to be recognized. This paper introduces PaW-ViT, Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer, a preprocessing approach rooted in anatomical knowledge that normalizes ear images to enhance the efficacy of ViT. By accurately aligning token boundaries to detected ear feature boundaries, PaW-ViT obtains greater robustness to shape, size, and pose variation. By aligning feature boundaries to natural ear curvature, it produces more consistent token representations for various morphologies. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PaW-ViT on various ViT models (ViT-T, ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) and yield reasonable alignment robustness to variation in shape, size, and pose. Our work aims to solve the disconnect between ear biometric morphological variation and transformer architecture positional sensitivity, presenting a possible avenue for authentication schemes.

Motivation: 现有3D场景生成方法受限于结构建模能力弱、严重依赖大规模真值监督，导致结构伪影、几何不一致及高频细节退化，难以满足快速迭代、高保真与易用性需求。

Method: 提出GeoDiff3D框架：1）以粗略几何作为结构锚点；2）采用几何约束的2D扩散模型生成纹理丰富的参考图像（容忍多视角不一致）；3）引入体素对齐的3D特征聚合；4）设计双重自监督机制。

Conclusion: GeoDiff3D提供了一种实用、高效且低依赖标注数据的3D场景生成新范式，适用于游戏、影视/VFX和VR/AR等实际应用场景。

Abstract: 3D scene generation is a core technology for gaming, film/VFX, and VR/AR. Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction.

Method: 采用基于扩散模型的耳部图像修复技术，输入耳部图像及自动生成的附件掩码，重建解剖结构合理、几何一致的耳部区域（包括耳轮、对耳轮、耳甲腔和耳垂）。

Result: 在多个Vision Transformer模型、不同patch尺寸及多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该扩散修复预处理能有效缓解耳饰遮挡，提升整体识别性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型驱动的耳部图像修复是一种有效的预处理手段，可显著改善耳部生物识别系统在存在附件遮挡场景下的鲁棒性与准确率。

Abstract: Ear occlusions (arising from the presence of ear accessories such as earrings and earphones) can negatively impact performance in ear-based biometric recognition systems, especially in unconstrained imaging circumstances. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Youtu-VL框架，通过Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision（VLUAS）范式，将视觉信号从“输入”转变为“目标”，实现对视觉细节和语言内容的统一自回归监督，从而提升多模态理解的细粒度能力，并支持通用视觉中心任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在保留细粒度视觉信息方面存在不足，主要源于训练范式中以文本为主导的优化偏差，即仅将视觉信号视为被动条件输入而非监督目标。

Method: 提出Youtu-VL框架，采用Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision（VLUAS）范式，将视觉token直接纳入预测流，对视觉细节和语言内容施加统一的自回归监督；并扩展该范式以支持视觉中心任务，无需任务特定修改。

Result: 在广泛实验中，Youtu-VL在通用多模态任务和视觉中心任务上均达到具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Youtu-VL为构建全面的通用视觉智能体提供了坚实基础，有效缓解了VLMs中视觉信息粗粒化的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements represented by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current architectures often exhibit limitations in retaining fine-grained visual information, leading to coarse-grained multimodal comprehension. We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的Query-guided Spatial-Temporal-Frequency (QSTar)交互方法和Query Context Reasoning (QCR)模块，以增强音频-视觉问答（AVQA）任务中的多模态理解能力，显著提升了在多个基准上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AVQA方法过度依赖视觉信息，音频仅作为补充，且问题文本对音视频理解贡献有限，主要在推理后期才被整合。

Method: 提出QSTar方法，融合问题引导线索与音频的频域特性及音视频的时空感知；并设计QCR模块，受提示学习启发，引导模型聚焦语义相关的音视频特征。

Result: 在多个AVQA基准上实验表明，所提方法显著优于现有Audio QA、Visual QA、Video QA和AVQA方法。

Conclusion: 通过问题引导的时空频联合建模与上下文感知推理，可有效提升AVQA任务中音视频与文本的协同理解能力。

Abstract: Audio--Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires jointly reasoning over audio, visual, and textual information in a given video to answer natural language questions. Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication.

TL;DR: 本文提出HexFormer，一种基于双曲几何的视觉Transformer，通过指数映射聚合改进注意力机制，提升图像分类性能与梯度稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态数据（如图像、文本、图）常具有层次化和关系结构，在欧氏几何中难以有效建模；而双曲几何天然适合表示此类结构。

Method: 提出HexFormer（纯双曲ViT）和HexFormer-Hybrid（双曲编码器+欧氏分类头），核心是基于指数映射聚合的新注意力机制，替代传统质心平均，并分析其梯度稳定性。

Result: 在多个数据集上一致优于欧氏基线及以往双曲ViT；Hybrid变体效果最佳；双曲模型梯度更稳定、对warmup策略更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 双曲几何可有效增强ViT架构，提升分类精度与训练鲁棒性；简单机制（如指数映射聚合）已具显著实用价值。

Abstract: Data across modalities such as images, text, and graphs often contains hierarchical and relational structures, which are challenging to model within Euclidean geometry. Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.

Abstract: Robust 3D hand reconstruction in egocentric vision is challenging due to depth ambiguity, self-occlusion, and complex hand-object interactions. Prior methods mitigate these issues by scaling training data or adding auxiliary cues, but they often struggle in unseen contexts. We present EgoHandICL, the first in-context learning (ICL) framework for 3D hand reconstruction that improves semantic alignment, visual consistency, and robustness under challenging egocentric conditions. EgoHandICL introduces complementary exemplar retrieval guided by vision-language models (VLMs), an ICL-tailored tokenizer for multimodal context, and a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based architecture trained with hand-guided geometric and perceptual objectives. Experiments on ARCTIC and EgoExo4D show consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出SONIC，一种基于连续谱参数化的神经网络架构，通过共享的方向选择性组件建模卷积算子，在保持结构化表示的同时实现全局感受野和跨分辨率自适应，显著提升对几何变换、噪声和分辨率变化的鲁棒性，并以更少参数达到或超越现有模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs受限于固定尺寸卷积核，难以捕捉全局上下文；ViTs虽具全局连接但缺乏空间归纳偏置且依赖位置编码；需一种兼具结构化与全局性的新表征方式。

Method: 提出SONIC（Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions），采用连续谱参数化方法，用少量共享、方向选择性组件定义覆盖全频域的平滑响应，从而生成具有全局感受野和天然多尺度适应能力的卷积算子。

Result: 在合成基准、大规模图像分类及3D医学数据集上，SONIC展现出对几何变换、噪声和分辨率变化更强的鲁棒性，且参数量减少一个数量级的同时，性能匹配或超越传统CNN、ViT及先前谱方法。

Conclusion: 连续、方向感知的谱参数化是一种原理清晰、可扩展性强的新范式，可作为传统空间与谱域算子的有效替代。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型对标准阿拉伯文本识别效果较好，但对具有复杂笔画、密集连字和高度风格化的阿拉伯书法处理能力不足，缺乏专门针对该任务的基准数据集。

Method: 构建DuwatBench数据集（1272个样本，覆盖6种古典与现代阿拉伯书法风格，含句子级检测标注），并系统评测13个阿拉伯语/多语言多模态模型在该数据集上的视觉-文本对齐性能。

Result: 所有被测模型在干净文本上表现良好，但在书法变体、艺术形变和精确图文对齐任务上普遍表现较差，凸显当前模型对阿拉伯视觉文化理解的局限性。

Conclusion: DuwatBench填补了阿拉伯书法多模态理解的评估空白，推动以文化为本的AI研究，促进阿拉伯语言与视觉遗产在AI系统中的公平包容与技术演进。

Abstract: Arabic calligraphy represents one of the richest visual traditions of the Arabic language, blending linguistic meaning with artistic form. Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area. Our dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/DuwatBench) and evaluation suit (https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/DuwatBench) are publicly available.

Conclusion: 基于语言家族的连接器共享是一种高效、可扩展的多语言ASR部署方案，兼顾性能、参数效率与泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems achieve strong performance with limited resources by linking a frozen speech encoder to a pretrained LLM via a lightweight connector. Prior work trains a separate connector per language, overlooking linguistic relatedness. We propose an efficient and novel connector-sharing strategy based on linguistic family membership, enabling one connector per family, and empirically validate its effectiveness across two multilingual LLMs and two real-world corpora spanning curated and crowd-sourced speech. Our results show that family-based connectors reduce parameter count while improving generalization across domains, offering a practical and scalable strategy for multilingual ASR deployment.

### [78] [Self-Aware Knowledge Probing: Evaluating Language Models' Relational Knowledge through Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18901)
*Christopher Kissling,Elena Merdjanovska,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的关系知识校准探测框架，涵盖内在置信度、结构一致性和语义基础三种模型置信度模态，发现多数语言模型（尤其是掩码预训练模型）存在过度自信问题，且大模型仍难以准确编码语言置信表达的语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识探测方法仅关注预测准确率等指标，忽略了模型置信度的校准性（即可靠性），无法全面评估语言模型所学关系知识的质量。

Method: 提出一种新型校准探测框架，从内在置信度、结构一致性（如陈述重述引发的不一致）、语义基础三方面量化模型对关系知识的置信校准程度，并在十种因果型和六种掩码型语言模型上进行系统分析。

Result: 大多数模型（尤其掩码预训练模型）显著过自信；考虑重述导致不一致的置信估计效果最佳；即使最大规模预训练模型也无法准确建模语言中置信表达的语义。

Conclusion: 校准性是评估语言模型关系知识的重要维度，仅靠准确率不足；未来模型需在训练和评估中显式建模置信校准，尤其提升对语言置信表达的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Knowledge probing quantifies how much relational knowledge a language model (LM) has acquired during pre-training. Existing knowledge probes evaluate model capabilities through metrics like prediction accuracy and precision. Such evaluations fail to account for the model's reliability, reflected in the calibration of its confidence scores. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration probing framework for relational knowledge, covering three modalities of model confidence: (1) intrinsic confidence, (2) structural consistency and (3) semantic grounding. Our extensive analysis of ten causal and six masked language models reveals that most models, especially those pre-trained with the masking objective, are overconfident. The best-calibrated scores come from confidence estimates that account for inconsistencies due to statement rephrasing. Moreover, even the largest pre-trained models fail to encode the semantics of linguistic confidence expressions accurately.

### [79] [Flatter Tokens are More Valuable for Speculative Draft Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18902)
*Jiaming Fan,Daming Cao,Xiangzhong Luo,Jiale Fu,Chonghan Liu,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于样本预测分布平坦度的数据蒸馏方法（SFDD），用于提升Speculative Decoding中draft模型的训练效率，在仅用50%数据的情况下实现2倍训练加速，且推理加速性能损失仅4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative Decoding通常需在大量数据上训练draft模型，但并非所有训练样本对提升接受率（acceptance rate）同等重要。

Method: 通过理论分析与实验验证发现：目标模型预测分布越平坦的token，对提升SD接受率越有价值；据此定义‘flatness’指标，并提出基于该指标的样本级数据蒸馏方法SFDD，筛选高价值样本进行训练。

Result: 在EAGLE框架上实验表明，SFDD仅用50%数据即可实现超2倍训练加速，最终模型推理加速效果相比全量数据基线仅下降4%。

Conclusion: SFDD是一种高效的数据中心化方法，显著提升了Speculative Decoding中draft模型的训练效率，为LLM推理加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a key technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference, but it typically requires training a draft model on a large dataset. We approach this problem from a data-centric perspective, finding that not all training samples contribute equally to the SD acceptance rate. Specifically, our theoretical analysis and empirical validation reveals that tokens inducing flatter predictive distributions from the target model are more valuable than those yielding sharply peaked distributions. Based on this insight, we propose flatness, a new metric to quantify this property, and develop the Sample-level-flatness-based Dataset Distillation (SFDD) approach, which filters the training data to retain only the most valuable samples. Experiments on the EAGLE framework demonstrate that SFDD can achieve over 2$\times$ training speedup using only 50% of the data, while keeping the final model's inference speedup within 4% of the full-dataset baseline. This work introduces an effective, data-centric approach that substantially improves the training efficiency for Speculative Decoding.

*Kaustubh D. Dhole*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了BabyReasoningBench，一个基于发展心理学经典范式的19项推理任务基准，用于评估在儿童导向语言数据上训练的“婴儿语言模型”的推理能力；结果显示，尽管规模扩大提升了部分因果和物理推理表现，但心理理论（如信念归因）和语用敏感任务仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理评测基准以成人中心、预设广泛常识与成熟语用能力，不适用于在儿童语言数据上训练的“婴儿语言模型”，因而无法揭示其真实推理能力的发展轨迹。

Method: 构建BabyReasoningBench——一个由GPT-5.2生成、涵盖心理理论、类比与关系推理、因果推断与干预选择、基础推理原语等五大类共19项任务的发展心理学驱动基准；并在两个基于GPT-2、分别在10M和100M儿童导向语音文本上预训练的“婴儿语言模型”上进行评测。

Result: 两个婴儿语言模型整体表现偏低但存在任务间分离：模型规模增大提升了部分因果与物理推理任务表现，而信念归因与语用敏感任务仍显著困难。

Conclusion: BabyReasoningBench为在类儿童训练分布下推理能力的涌现机制提供了发展心理学视角的评估框架，并支持对相关认知能力形成机制的可检验假设。

Abstract: Traditional evaluations of reasoning capabilities of language models are dominated by adult-centric benchmarks that presuppose broad world knowledge, complex instruction following, and mature pragmatic competence. These assumptions are mismatched to baby language models trained on developmentally plausible input such as child-directed speech and early-childhood narratives, and they obscure which reasoning abilities (if any) emerge under such constraints. We introduce BabyReasoningBench, a GPT-5.2 generated benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks grounded in classic paradigms from developmental psychology, spanning theory of mind, analogical and relational reasoning, causal inference and intervention selection, and core reasoning primitives that are known to be confounded by memory and pragmatics. We find that two GPT-2 based baby language models (pretrained on 10M and 100M of child-directed speech text) show overall low but uneven performance, with dissociations across task families: scaling improves several causal and physical reasoning tasks, while belief attribution and pragmatics-sensitive tasks remain challenging. BabyReasoningBench provides a developmentally grounded lens for analyzing what kinds of reasoning are supported by child-like training distributions, and for testing mechanistic hypotheses about how such abilities emerge.

*Oren Sultan,Jordi Armengol-Estape,Pascal Kesseli,Julien Vanegue,Dafna Shahaf,Yossi Adi,Peter O'Hearn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在预测C程序终止性方面的性能，发现GPT-5和Claude Sonnet-4.5等模型在SV-Comp 2025终止性基准上表现优异，接近顶尖专用工具，但缺乏可验证的终止证明，且性能随程序长度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受LLM在各类任务中取得进展的启发，探究其是否能可靠解决经典的不可判定问题——程序终止性判定。

Method: 在SV-Comp 2025终止性类别提供的多样化C程序集上，评测多个主流LLM（如GPT-5、Claude Sonnet-4.5、Code World Model）的终止预测准确率，并分析其提供证明能力与程序长度敏感性。

Result: LLM在终止预测任务上表现突出，GPT-5和Claude Sonnet-4.5排名接近SV-Comp 2025中最佳专用工具；但多数情况下无法生成有效终止性证明（witness），且性能随程序长度增长明显下降。

Conclusion: LLM展现出对不可判定问题（如终止性）进行实用级预测的潜力，但尚不能替代形式化验证工具；其局限性（如缺乏可验证证明、规模敏感）指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.

*Zahra Hashemi,Zhiqiang Zhong,Jun Pang,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端管道，利用说服式越狱绕过LLM安全机制，从NLP论文中识别并恶意重用开放科学成果（如数据集、方法、工具），并通过多维评估框架分析其危害性、滥用可行性与技术合理性；结果表明LLM可生成有害提案，但作为评估者时各模型间评分分歧显著，难以替代人工进行可信的双重用途风险评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究关注LLM在科学发现中的积极作用，却忽视其可能被滥用于基于开放科学成果生成有害研究的风险。

Method: 构建端到端管道：1）说服式 jailbreaking 绕过LLM安全防护；2）重新解读NLP论文以识别并恶意重用其开放成果（数据集、方法、工具）；3）设计三维度评估框架（危害性、滥用可行性、技术严谨性）对生成提案进行安全评估。

Result: LLM能成功生成由伦理设计的开放成果衍生出的有害研究提案；但不同LLM评估器（GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5-pro、Grok-3）在评估结果上存在显著分歧，显示其尚不具备可靠判别能力。

Conclusion: 当前LLM不适合作为恶意用途风险评估的独立判断主体，人类专家评估仍不可或缺。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has fuelled enthusiasm about their role in advancing scientific discovery, with studies exploring LLMs that autonomously generate and evaluate novel research ideas. However, little attention has been given to the possibility that such models could be exploited to produce harmful research by repurposing open science artefacts for malicious ends. We fill the gap by introducing an end-to-end pipeline that first bypasses LLM safeguards through persuasion-based jailbreaking, then reinterprets NLP papers to identify and repurpose their artefacts (datasets, methods, and tools) by exploiting their vulnerabilities, and finally assesses the safety of these proposals using our evaluation framework across three dimensions: harmfulness, feasibility of misuse, and soundness of technicality. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate harmful proposals by repurposing ethically designed open artefacts; however, we find that LLMs acting as evaluators strongly disagree with one another on evaluation outcomes: GPT-4.1 assigns higher scores (indicating greater potential harms, higher soundness and feasibility of misuse), Gemini-2.5-pro is markedly stricter, and Grok-3 falls between these extremes. This indicates that LLMs cannot yet serve as reliable judges in a malicious evaluation setup, making human evaluation essential for credible dual-use risk assessment.

*Haozheng Luo,Zhuolin Jiang,Md Zahid Hasan,Yan Chen,Soumalya Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FROST是一种注意力感知的高效推理方法，通过利用注意力权重剪枝不重要的推理路径，显著减少token使用并提升推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理方法存在冗余推理路径，导致计算开销大、可靠性低，亟需一种能动态识别并剔除无效推理步骤的机制。

Method: 提出‘推理异常值’概念，设计基于注意力机制的句子级异常值识别与剪枝方法，在保持甚至增强模型推理能力的同时压缩推理轨迹。

Result: 在四个基准上超越TALE、ThinkLess等SOTA方法；平均降低69.68% token用量，准确率提升26.70%；注意力异常指标（无穷范数、峰度）显著下降。

Conclusion: FROST通过注意力驱动的异常值剔除，在效率与性能间实现更好权衡，为高效可靠推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: We propose FROST, an attention-aware method for efficient reasoning. Unlike traditional approaches, FROST leverages attention weights to prune uncritical reasoning paths, yielding shorter and more reliable reasoning trajectories. Methodologically, we introduce the concept of reasoning outliers and design an attention-based mechanism to remove them. Theoretically, FROST preserves and enhances the model's reasoning capacity while eliminating outliers at the sentence level. Empirically, we validate FROST on four benchmarks using two strong reasoning models (Phi-4-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B), outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as TALE and ThinkLess. Notably, FROST achieves an average 69.68% reduction in token usage and a 26.70% improvement in accuracy over the base model. Furthermore, in evaluations of attention outlier metrics, FROST reduces the maximum infinity norm by 15.97% and the average kurtosis by 91.09% compared to the base model.

*Siddhant Arora,Jinchuan Tian,Jiatong Shi,Hayato Futami,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Emiru Tsunoo,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个面向语音对话系统的多奖励RLAIF框架，结合语义、音频质量和情感一致性奖励，并通过轮次级偏好采样与块级DPO优化，系统研究了其在多轮和块式双工模型中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF/RLAIF方法在语音对话系统中仅使用单一语义奖励，忽视了对话质量的多维多模态特性（如语义连贯性、音频自然度、说话人一致性、情感对齐、轮转行为），且与增量式双工语音生成机制不匹配。

Method: 提出首个面向语音对话系统的多奖励RLAIF框架，融合语义、音频质量与情感一致性三类奖励；为适配块式增量解码，采用轮次级偏好采样，并将每块对数概率聚合进单一DPO目标函数中。

Result: 实验表明：单奖励RLAIF仅提升对应指标，而联合多奖励训练能一致提升语义质量和音频自然度；首次构建并开源了多奖励DPO数据集。

Conclusion: 语音对话系统的实际部署需采用兼顾多维度质量的全息式多奖励对齐策略，而非单一指标优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) for speech-in/speech-out dialogue systems (SDS) remains underexplored, with prior work largely limited to single semantic rewards applied at the utterance level. Such setups overlook the multi-dimensional and multi-modal nature of conversational quality, which encompasses semantic coherence, audio naturalness, speaker consistency, emotion alignment, and turn-taking behavior. Moreover, they are fundamentally mismatched with duplex spoken dialogue systems that generate responses incrementally, where agents must make decisions based on partial utterances. We address these limitations with the first multi-reward RLAIF framework for SDS, combining semantic, audio-quality, and emotion-consistency rewards. To align utterance-level preferences with incremental, blockwise decoding in duplex models, we apply turn-level preference sampling and aggregate per-block log-probabilities within a single DPO objective. We present the first systematic study of preference learning for improving SDS quality in both multi-turn Chain-of-Thought and blockwise duplex models, and release a multi-reward DPO dataset to support reproducible research. Experiments show that single-reward RLAIF selectively improves its targeted metric, while joint multi-reward training yields consistent gains across semantic quality and audio naturalness. These results highlight the importance of holistic, multi-reward alignment for practical conversational SDS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PsyProbe，一种基于PPPPPI框架和认知错误检测的心理健康对话系统，用于咨询探索阶段，通过状态构建、记忆构建、策略规划和响应生成模块实现主动提问，并在真实韩语咨询场景中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康对话系统多为被动式，缺乏对用户心理状态的系统建模，难以支持主动治疗性探索。

Method: 提出PsyProbe系统，整合PPPPPI心理评估框架与认知错误检测；包含State Builder（结构化心理档案抽取）、Memory Construction（信息缺口追踪）、Strategy Planner（动机访谈行为编码）和Response Generator（含提问创意与批评修订模块）；在27名参与者的真实韩语咨询场景中进行自动评估、用户评估与专业咨询师评估。

Result: PsyProbe在自动评估中全面优于基线与消融模型；用户评估显示参与意愿与自然度显著提升；专家评估表明其核心问题理解能力大幅增强，提问质量接近专业咨询师。

Conclusion: 系统化的用户心理状态建模与主动提问机制可有效提升心理健康对话系统在治疗探索阶段的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled mental health dialogue systems, yet existing approaches remain predominantly reactive, lacking systematic user state modeling for proactive therapeutic exploration. We introduce PsyProbe, a dialogue system designed for the exploration phase of counseling that systematically tracks user psychological states through the PPPPPI framework (Presenting, Predisposing, Precipitating, Perpetuating, Protective, Impact) augmented with cognitive error detection. PsyProbe combines State Builder for extracting structured psychological profiles, Memory Construction for tracking information gaps, Strategy Planner for Motivational Interviewing behavioral codes, and Response Generator with Question Ideation and Critic/Revision modules to generate contextually appropriate, proactive questions. We evaluate PsyProbe with 27 participants in real-world Korean counseling scenarios, including automatic evaluation across ablation modes, user evaluation, and expert evaluation by a certified counselor. The full PsyProbe model consistently outperforms baseline and ablation modes in automatic evaluation. User evaluation demonstrates significantly increased engagement intention and improved naturalness compared to baseline. Expert evaluation shows that PsyProbe substantially improves core issue understanding and achieves question rates comparable to professional counselors, validating the effectiveness of systematic state modeling and proactive questioning for therapeutic exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巴纳语作为越南少数民族语言面临资源匮乏问题，亟需高效、低成本的机器翻译方案以支持语言保护与代际传播。

Method: 采用前沿神经机器翻译框架，并设计两种灵活、低开销的领域特定数据增强策略，兼容多种NMT模型且不依赖额外训练系统或数据。

Result: 所提方法在越南语-巴纳语翻译任务上有效提升了翻译质量，验证了其在低资源场景下的实用性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为濒危少数民族语言的机器翻译提供了可扩展、易部署的技术路径，助力语言数字化保存与教育应用。

Abstract: The Bahnar people, an ethnic minority in Vietnam with a rich ancestral heritage, possess a language of immense cultural and historical significance. The government places a strong emphasis on preserving and promoting the Bahnaric language by making it accessible online and encouraging communication across generations. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), have brought about a transformation in translation by improving accuracy and fluency. This, in turn, contributes to the revival of the language through educational efforts, communication, and documentation. Specifically, NMT is pivotal in enhancing accessibility for Bahnaric speakers, making information and content more readily available. Nevertheless, the translation of Vietnamese into Bahnaric faces practical challenges due to resource constraints, especially given the limited resources available for the Bahnaric language. To address this, we employ state-of-the-art techniques in NMT along with two augmentation strategies for domain-specific Vietnamese-Bahnaric translation task. Importantly, both approaches are flexible and can be used with various neural machine translation models. Additionally, they do not require complex data preprocessing steps, the training of additional systems, or the acquisition of extra data beyond the existing training parallel corpora.

TL;DR: TeMLM is a transparency-first framework for clinical language models, providing standardized artifacts (TeMLM-Card, TeMLM-Datasheet, TeMLM-Provenance) and a conformance checklist to improve reproducibility and auditability; it is demonstrated on the synthetic Technetium-I dataset and ProtactiniumBERT model for PHI de-identification and ICD-9 code extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address lack of transparency, reproducibility, and auditability in clinical language models, especially regarding data provenance, modeling choices, and governance.

Method: Design and standardization of transparency artifacts (TeMLM-Card, TeMLM-Datasheet, TeMLM-Provenance) and a lightweight conformance checklist; instantiation on synthetic dataset Technetium-I and evaluation of ProtactiniumBERT on two clinical NLP tasks.

Result: Successful instantiation of TeMLM artifacts on Technetium-I; reference performance reported for ProtactiniumBERT on PHI de-identification and ICD-9 code extraction; emphasis placed on synthetic data’s role for tooling validation—not deployment.

Conclusion: TeMLM provides a practical, machine-checkable framework to enhance transparency and accountability in clinical NLP; synthetic benchmarks are useful for development and auditing but cannot replace real-data validation before deployment.

Abstract: We introduce TeMLM, a set of transparency-first release artifacts for clinical language models. TeMLM unifies provenance, data transparency, modeling transparency, and governance into a single, machine-checkable release bundle. We define an artifact suite (TeMLM-Card, TeMLM-Datasheet, TeMLM-Provenance) and a lightweight conformance checklist for repeatable auditing. We instantiate the artifacts on Technetium-I, a large-scale synthetic clinical NLP dataset with 498,000 notes, 7.74M PHI entity annotations across 10 types, and ICD-9-CM diagnosis labels, and report reference results for ProtactiniumBERT (about 100 million parameters) on PHI de-identification (token classification) and top-50 ICD-9 code extraction (multi-label classification). We emphasize that synthetic benchmarks are valuable for tooling and process validation, but models should be validated on real clinical data prior to deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注纯文本领域中的信息误导问题，而视觉-语言模型（VLMs）如何协调模态间矛盾信息（尤其是文本误导干扰视觉证据）尚不明确，亟需系统性评估。

Method: 构建CONTEXT-VQA数据集（含图像-问题对及系统生成的、与视觉内容冲突的说服性文本提示），设计全面评估框架，对11种前沿VLM进行鲁棒性测试。

Result: 实验表明，所有被测VLM均易受误导性文本影响，常忽略清晰视觉证据而采信矛盾文本，单轮说服性对话即导致平均性能下降超48.2%。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在跨模态冲突情境下鲁棒性严重不足，亟需提升其抵抗文本操纵的能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on Visual-Question-Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, their robustness against textual misinformation remains under-explored. While existing research has studied the effect of misinformation in text-only domains, it is not clear how VLMs arbitrate between contradictory information from different modalities. To bridge the gap, we first propose the CONTEXT-VQA (i.e., Conflicting Text) dataset, consisting of image-question pairs together with systematically generated persuasive prompts that deliberately conflict with visual evidence. Then, a thorough evaluation framework is designed and executed to benchmark the susceptibility of various models to these conflicting multimodal inputs. Comprehensive experiments over 11 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that these models are indeed vulnerable to misleading textual prompts, often overriding clear visual evidence in favor of the conflicting text, and show an average performance drop of over 48.2% after only one round of persuasive conversation. Our findings highlight a critical limitation in current VLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against textual manipulation.

TL;DR: 本文通过训练动力学视角，分析了基于注意力机制的语言模型如何从自然语言数据中学习语义关联，并推导出早期训练阶段权重的闭式表达，揭示了Transformer各层权重可分解为三种基础函数（二元组、词元可交换性、上下文映射）的组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语义关联在语言模型中如何被学习和表征，有助于连接深度学习与语言学理论，并为大语言模型建立机制性基础。

Method: 利用梯度的首项近似，推导出训练初期权重的闭式表达；将Transformer各组权重表示为三种基础函数（bigram、token-interchangeability、context mappings）的简单组合；结合真实LLM实验验证理论结果。

Result: 发现Transformer各组权重具有由文本语料统计决定的闭式表达，且该理论刻画与实际训练得到的权重高度吻合；定理有助于解释模型中习得的语义关联。

Conclusion: 语义关联的形成可被精确建模为基本统计模式的组合，为理解Transformer内部工作机制提供了可解释的理论框架。

Abstract: Semantic associations such as the link between "bird" and "flew" are foundational for language modeling as they enable models to go beyond memorization and instead generalize and generate coherent text. Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions. Experiments on real-world LLMs demonstrate that our theoretical weight characterizations closely match the learned weights, and qualitative analyses further show how our theorem shines light on interpreting the learned associations in transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在混杂意图的非结构化文本中精准提取企业真正需要的具体改进指令，缺乏细粒度、高精度的可操作建议挖掘能力。

Method: 构建混合流水线：先用高召回率RoBERTa分类器（采用精确率-召回率代理损失）筛选含建议句子，再由可控的指令微调LLM完成建议抽取、分类、聚类与摘要。

Result: 在真实酒店与餐饮数据集上，该系统在提取准确率与聚类一致性上均优于纯提示、规则和仅分类器等基线；人工评估证实其输出清晰、忠实且可解释。

Conclusion: 混合推理架构能显著提升细粒度可操作建议挖掘效果，但也揭示了领域适配与高效本地部署等挑战。

Abstract: Extracting actionable suggestions from customer reviews is essential for operational decision-making, yet these directives are often embedded within mixed-intent, unstructured text. Existing approaches either classify suggestion-bearing sentences or generate high-level summaries, but rarely isolate the precise improvement instructions businesses need. We evaluate a hybrid pipeline combining a high-recall RoBERTa classifier trained with a precision-recall surrogate to reduce unrecoverable false negatives with a controlled, instruction-tuned LLM for suggestion extraction, categorization, clustering, and summarization. Across real-world hospitality and food datasets, the hybrid system outperforms prompt-only, rule-based, and classifier-only baselines in extraction accuracy and cluster coherence. Human evaluations further confirm that the resulting suggestions and summaries are clear, faithful, and interpretable. Overall, our results show that hybrid reasoning architectures achieve meaningful improvements fine-grained actionable suggestion mining while highlighting challenges in domain adaptation and efficient local deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DREAMSTATE框架，利用条件扩散Transformer建模RWKV模型的内部状态，揭示其作为可编辑知识表示的潜力，并设计一种结合RNN局部优势与全局上下文自适应能力的新型混合架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代RNN（如RWKV）虽具备高效短程建模和固定大小状态的优势，但其内部状态作为可编辑知识表示的研究严重不足。

Method: 提出DREAMSTATE框架，使用条件Diffusion Transformer（DiT）直接建模RWKV状态的概率流形；进一步设计并行DiT模块，动态生成和调整RWKV核心模块的WKV参数，构建RNN与全局上下文感知融合的混合架构。

Result: 通过t-SNE可视化和可控生成实验验证了状态表征的结构性；混合模型在多目标损失下训练稳定，展现出可行性；代码已开源。

Conclusion: 本工作开辟了RNN状态表征研究的新方向，并为未来模型设计提供了具体可行的架构参考。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as RWKV, are distinguished by their powerful short-range modeling capabilities and efficient fixed-size states, which constitute a core advantage over standard Transformers. However, there is a significant lack of research into their internal state as an editable knowledge representation. To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility. Our work not only opens a new research direction for RNN state representation but also provides a concrete architectural reference for future model design.

### [92] [RPO-RAG: Aligning Small LLMs with Relation-aware Preference Optimization for Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19225)
*Kaehyun Um,KyuHwan Yeom,Haerim Yang,Minyoung Choi,Hyeongjun Yang,Kyong-Ho Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了RPO-RAG，一种专为小型语言模型（<8B参数）设计的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成框架，通过语义感知路径采样、关系感知偏好优化和答案中心化提示设计，显著提升小模型在知识图谱问答任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法存在路径采样缺乏语义感知、与知识图谱推理目标对齐弱、未组织为答案中心推理路径等问题，且多依赖大模型，忽视了小模型（<7B）的潜力。

Method: 提出RPO-RAG框架，包含三项创新：(1) 查询-路径语义采样策略；(2) 关系感知偏好优化，利用中间推理信号（如关系）进行对齐训练；(3) 答案中心化提示设计，以可解释格式组织实体与推理路径。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ两个KGQA基准数据集上取得显著效果：WebQSP上F1提升最高达8.8%；CWQ上在<8B参数模型中达到Hit和F1新SOTA；甚至在<3B参数模型上也展现出强推理能力。

Conclusion: RPO-RAG首次系统性地提升了小参数语言模型在知识图谱问答中的推理能力，验证了其在资源受限和端侧部署场景下的实用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出DiaDem模型，通过合成高质量数据集和两阶段GRPO策略提升音频视频字幕中对话描述的准确性，并引入DiaDemBench基准测试其在多种对话场景下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频视频字幕模型难以生成忠实准确的对话描述，影响下游理解和生成任务。

Method: 提出DiaDem模型，构建高质量监督微调（SFT）数据集，并采用难度划分的两阶段GRPO策略优化对话描述；同时设计DiaDemBench基准，评估说话人归属准确性和话语转录保真度。

Result: DiaDem在DiaDemBench上显著优于Gemini系列模型，在对话描述准确率上表现突出，且在通用音频视频字幕基准上也具竞争力。

Conclusion: DiaDem有效提升了音频视频字幕中对话描述的准确性与整体性能，DiaDemBench揭示当前主流模型（包括商用模型）在此任务上仍有较大改进空间。

Abstract: Accurate dialogue description in audiovisual video captioning is crucial for downstream understanding and generation tasks. However, existing models generally struggle to produce faithful dialogue descriptions within audiovisual captions. To mitigate this limitation, we propose DiaDem, a powerful audiovisual video captioning model capable of generating captions with more precise dialogue descriptions while maintaining strong overall performance. We first synthesize a high-quality dataset for SFT, then employ a difficulty-partitioned two-stage GRPO strategy to further enhance dialogue descriptions. To enable systematic evaluation of dialogue description capabilities, we introduce DiaDemBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate models across diverse dialogue scenarios, emphasizing both speaker attribution accuracy and utterance transcription fidelity in audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments on DiaDemBench reveal even commercial models still exhibit substantial room for improvement in dialogue-aware captioning. Notably, DiaDem not only outperforms the Gemini series in dialogue description accuracy but also achieves competitive performance on general audiovisual captioning benchmarks, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynCABEL是一种利用大语言模型生成上下文丰富的合成训练数据，以缓解生物医学实体链接中专家标注数据稀缺问题的新框架，在多个多语言基准上达到新SOTA，并提升临床有效预测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督式生物医学实体链接（BEL）中专家标注训练数据稀缺这一核心瓶颈。

Method: 提出SynCABEL框架，利用大语言模型为知识库中所有候选概念生成上下文丰富的合成训练样本；结合解码器-only模型与引导式推理；引入LLM-as-a-judge协议评估临床有效性。

Result: 在MedMentions（英文）、QUAERO（法文）、SPACCC（西班牙文）三个多语言基准上达到新SOTA；仅用最多40%的人工标注数据即可达到全监督性能；显著提升临床有效预测率。

Conclusion: SynCABEL有效缓解标注数据依赖，提升模型性能与临床实用性，所释放的数据、模型与代码支持可复现性与后续研究。

Abstract: We present SynCABEL (Synthetic Contextualized Augmentation for Biomedical Entity Linking), a framework that addresses a central bottleneck in supervised biomedical entity linking (BEL): the scarcity of expert-annotated training data. SynCABEL leverages large language models to generate context-rich synthetic training examples for all candidate concepts in a target knowledge base, providing broad supervision without manual annotation. We demonstrate that SynCABEL, when combined with decoder-only models and guided inference establish new state-of-the-art results across three widely used multilingual benchmarks: MedMentions for English, QUAERO for French, and SPACCC for Spanish. Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling. Finally, acknowledging that standard evaluation based on exact code matching often underestimates clinically valid predictions due to ontology redundancy, we introduce an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. This analysis reveals that SynCABEL significantly improves the rate of clinically valid predictions. Our synthetic datasets, models, and code are released to support reproducibility and future research.

### [95] [Riddle Quest : The Enigma of Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19273)
*Niharika Sri Parasa,Chaitali Diwan,Srinath Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于类比的谜语生成与评估流程，通过构建概念三元组、语义映射、风格化生成和答案验证四个模块，考察大语言模型对谜语多义答案的覆盖能力，发现模型常漏掉非主答案，揭示其推理完整性与歧义处理的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在推理覆盖度和歧义处理方面的能力，利用谜语这一轻量级工具检验模型是否能识别多种合理答案而非仅主答案。

Method: 构建四步管道：1）三元组生成器提取概念结构化事实；2）语义映射器筛选适合类比的属性；3）风格化生成器将属性转化为谜语线索；4）验证器枚举所有可能答案以评估模型表现。

Result: 实验表明，大语言模型虽常能猜中谜语的主答案，但频繁遗漏其他语义上合理的答案，说明其推理覆盖不全、歧义解析能力有限。

Conclusion: 基于类比的谜语可作为有效且轻量的评估工具，用于诊断语言模型在复杂推理与多义理解方面的薄弱环节。

Abstract: Riddles are concise linguistic puzzles that describe an object or idea through indirect, figurative, or playful clues. They are a longstanding form of creative expression, requiring the solver to interpret hints, recognize patterns, and draw inferences to identify the answers. In this work, we introduce a simple pipeline for creating and evaluating analogy-based riddles. The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types. Our case study shows that while models often guess the main intended answer, they frequently miss other valid interpretations. This highlights the value of riddles as a lightweight tool for examining reasoning coverage and ambiguity handling in language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DART方法，利用并行生成减少草稿阶段延迟，通过单次前向传播预测多个未来位置的logits，并结合N元语法约束的树剪枝算法构建高质量草稿树，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升端到端解码速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模型的草稿机制（如EAGLE3）虽提升准确性，但因多步自回归推理导致草稿延迟高，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: DART借鉴扩散式大语言模型思想，基于目标模型隐藏状态单次前向传播并行预测多个掩码位置的logits；并设计高效树剪枝算法，构建满足N-gram语义连续性的高质量草稿token树。

Result: DART在多个数据集上实现2.03x–3.44x实测时间加速，平均比EAGLE3快30%，显著降低草稿阶段开销且保持高草稿准确率。

Conclusion: DART是一种轻量、高效、实用的推测性解码框架，有效解决了草稿阶段延迟问题，为LLM推理加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless approach for accelerating LLM inference. However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework.

*Jesus Lovon-Melgarejo,Jose G. Moreno,Christine Damase-Michel,Lynda Tamine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Rewrite-To-Predict（ReToP）的新框架，通过端到端训练EHR重写器和临床预测器，利用临床驱动的特征选择生成伪标签，并引入Classifier Supervised Contribution（CSC）分数对齐重写与预测目标，显著提升MIMIC-IV上多个临床预测任务性能，且具备跨数据集与任务的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的EHR建模方法多为任务无关，仅将LLM用作编码器或补全模块，未能充分融合预测任务信号，限制了预测精度。

Method: 提出ReToP框架，包含EHR重写器和临床预测器的端到端联合训练；采用临床驱动的特征选择生成多样化患者重写的合成伪标签用于重写器微调；设计Classifier Supervised Contribution（CSC）分数引导重写器生成更契合预测任务的临床相关重写。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV三个临床任务上显著超越强基线模型；验证了其对未见数据集和任务的泛化能力，仅需少量微调；重写结果保持忠实性，并突出任务相关预测特征。

Conclusion: ReToP通过任务感知的EHR重写机制，有效弥合了LLM通用知识与特定临床预测需求之间的鸿沟，为可解释、高效且泛化的EHR建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide crucial information for clinical decision-making. However, their high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity make clinical prediction challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction. Our ReToP framework surpasses strong baseline models across three clinical tasks on MIMIC-IV. Moreover, the analysis of ReToP shows its generalizability to unseen datasets and tasks with minimal fine-tuning while preserving faithful rewrites and emphasizing task-relevant predictive features.

*Mahdi Astaraki,Mohammad Arshi Saloot,Ali Shiraee Kasmaee,Hamidreza Mahyar,Soheila Samiee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过控制实验首次系统评估了迭代式检索-推理（Iterative RAG）是否能超越理想静态RAG（Gold Context），发现在化学多跳问答任务中，Iterative RAG显著优于Gold Context，尤其对未微调模型提升达25.6个百分点；其优势源于分阶段检索缓解晚期失败、上下文过载与假设漂移，但仍有覆盖不全、干扰项锁定、早停误判和组合失败等瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG在科学领域（如多跳推理、稀疏知识、异构证据）中，尚不清楚迭代式检索-推理是否真正优于静态RAG；缺乏机制层面的诊断分析。

Method: 构建三类基准设置（无上下文、Gold Context、Iterative RAG），在ChemKGMultiHopQA数据集上评测11个SOTA LLM，并设计多项诊断指标（检索覆盖率、锚点丢失、查询质量、组合保真度、控制校准等）进行机制分析。

Result: Iterative RAG在所有模型上持续超越Gold Context，最高提升25.6个百分点；分阶段检索可降低晚期失败、缓解上下文过载、动态修正早期假设漂移；但仍存在hop覆盖不全、干扰项锁定、早停误判及高组合失败率等问题。

Conclusion:  staged retrieval（分阶段检索）本身的影响常超过单纯提供理想证据；该研究为科学领域RAG部署与诊断提供实践指南，并为构建更可靠可控的迭代式检索-推理框架奠定基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.

TL;DR: 本文提出MetaGen框架，无需训练即可在推理时动态调整角色空间和协作拓扑，提升多智能体系统在复杂任务中的准确率与成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统依赖固定角色库和静态交互结构，导致任务不匹配、难以适应新证据、推理开销大。

Method: MetaGen通过生成和重写查询条件的角色定义来构建动态角色池，并围绕最小主干构建受限执行图；执行中利用轻量反馈信号迭代更新角色提示和结构调整。

Result: 在代码生成和多步推理基准上，MetaGen相比强多智能体基线提升了准确率与成本的权衡表现。

Conclusion: MetaGen是一种训练无关、推理时自适应的多智能体协作框架，有效缓解了角色与拓扑僵化问题，兼顾性能与效率。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed as multi-agent systems, where specialized roles communicate and collaborate through structured interactions to solve complex tasks that often exceed the capacity of a single agent. However, most existing systems still rely on a fixed role library and an execution-frozen interaction topology, a rigid design choice that frequently leads to task mismatch, prevents timely adaptation when new evidence emerges during reasoning, and further inflates inference cost. We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights. MetaGen generates and rewrites query-conditioned role specifications to maintain a controllable dynamic role pool, then instantiates a constrained execution graph around a minimal backbone. During execution, it iteratively updates role prompts and adjusts structural decisions using lightweight feedback signals. Experiments on code generation and multi-step reasoning benchmarks show that MetaGen improves the accuracy and cost tradeoff over strong multi-agent baselines.

*Natapong Nitarach,Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Formula-One Prompting（F-1），一种两阶段提示方法：先从问题中提取控制方程，再根据方程自适应选择CoT、PoT或直接计算策略；在多个模型和基准上显著提升应用数学（如金融、物理）的推理性能，优于CoT和PoT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链（CoT）和程序链（PoT）方法未显式利用应用数学问题中关键的控制方程推导或回忆步骤，限制了其在金融、物理、密码学等领域的推理能力。

Method: 提出Formula-One Prompting（F-1）：第一阶段从问题描述中生成数学控制方程；第二阶段基于生成的方程，在单次LLM调用内自适应选择CoT、PoT或直接计算作为求解策略。

Result: 在五个模型和四个基准上的实验表明，F-1平均比CoT高+5.76%，比PoT高+8.42%；在FinanceMath上比CoT高+13.30%，在OlympiadBench中对物理题提升（+2.55%）明显高于纯数学题（+0.44%）。

Conclusion: F-1通过显式建模和利用控制方程，显著增强了大语言模型在应用数学问题上的推理能力，尤其在需物理建模或领域知识的场景中效果更优。

Abstract: Prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-of-Thought (PoT) improve LLM mathematical reasoning by structuring intermediate steps in natural language or code. However, applied mathematics problems in domains like finance, physics, and cryptography often require recalling or deriving governing equations, a step that current approaches do not explicitly leverage. We propose Formula-One Prompting (F-1), a two-phase approach that uses mathematical equations as an intermediate representation before adaptive solving. F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average. Crucially, gains are largest in applied domains: +13.30% on FinanceMath over CoT, and within OlympiadBench, larger gains on physics (+2.55%) than pure math (+0.44%). This demonstrates that F-1 is more effective than CoT in applied mathematics problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DeconIEP框架，在评估阶段通过在输入嵌入空间施加小而有界的扰动来缓解测试集污染问题，利用参考模型指导生成实例自适应扰动，有效抑制记忆驱动的捷径行为，同时保持对干净样本的良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试已成为大语言模型（LLM）评测的主流方式，但测试集污染（即测试样本或其变体泄露进训练数据）严重威胁其可靠性，导致性能虚高。

Method: 提出DeconIEP去污染框架：在评估阶段不修改测试集、也不干预模型内部结构，而是基于一个污染较轻的参考模型，学习一个实例自适应的输入嵌入扰动生成器，在嵌入空间施加小且有界的扰动，引导被评估模型避开记忆驱动的捷径路径。

Result: 在多个开源权重LLM和基准上验证，DeconIEP在显著提升去污染效果的同时，仅带来极小的正常性能下降。

Conclusion: DeconIEP提供了一种高效、低侵入的评估期去污染新范式，兼顾去污染能力与模型良性效用，优于现有移除污染项或运行时干预的方法。

Abstract: Benchmark-based evaluation is the de facto standard for comparing large language models (LLMs). However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需参考文本的多维评估框架CEF，通过将源文本和候选文本视为独立知识库，生成可验证问题并进行交叉检验，输出Coverage、Conformity、Consistency三个可解释分数，在翻译、摘要和临床文本生成任务中验证了其识别语义错误（如遗漏、事实矛盾）的能力，并通过鲁棒性分析与人工验证证明其可靠性与有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标（如BLEU、BERTScore）无法有效衡量生成式文本到文本任务中的语义保真度。

Method: 改进Cross-Examination Framework（CEF），采用无参考、多维度评估范式：将源文本和候选文本分别视为独立知识库，从中生成可验证问题，并通过交叉检验计算Coverage、Conformity、Consistency三个分数；同时开展系统性鲁棒性分析以选择稳定判别模型。

Result: 在翻译、摘要和临床笔记生成任务上验证有效；能识别BLEU等指标遗漏的关键语义错误（如内容遗漏、事实矛盾）；无参考模式与有参考模式高度相关；人工专家验证表明CEF错配问题更常对应语义层面（尤其是实体与关系层面）的含义改变错误。

Conclusion: CEF是一种可靠、可解释、无需参考文本的语义保真度评估框架，在识别深层语义错误方面显著优于传统指标。

Abstract: Traditional metrics like BLEU and BERTScore fail to capture semantic fidelity in generative text-to-text tasks. We adapt the Cross-Examination Framework (CEF) for a reference-free, multi-dimensional evaluation by treating the source and candidate as independent knowledge bases. CEF generates verifiable questions from each text and performs a cross-examination to derive three interpretable scores: Coverage, Conformity, and Consistency. Validated across translation, summarization and clinical note-generation, our framework identifies critical errors, such as content omissions and factual contradictions, missed by standard metrics. A key contribution is a systematic robustness analysis to select a stable judge model. Crucially, the strong correlation between our reference-free and with-reference modes validates CEF's reliability without gold references. Furthermore, human expert validation demonstrates that CEF mismatching questions align with meaning-altering semantic errors higher than with non-semantic errors, particularly excelling at identifying entity-based and relational distortions.

Our DeBERTa-v3-large model achieves 69.8% F1 on the CoAM dataset, surpassing the best results (Qwen-72B, 57.8% F1) on this dataset by 12 points while using 165x fewer parameters. We achieve this performance by (1) reformulating detection as binary token-level START/END/INSIDE classification rather than span-based prediction, (2) incorporating NP chunking and dependency features that help discontinuous and NOUN-type MWEs identification, and (3) applying oversampling that addresses severe class imbalance in the training data. We confirm the generalization of our method on the STREUSLE dataset, achieving 78.9% F1. These results demonstrate that carefully designed smaller models can substantially outperform LLMs on structured NLP tasks, with important implications for resource-constrained deployments.

### [104] [Do LLMs Truly Benefit from Longer Context in Automatic Post-Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19410)
*Ahrii Kim,Seong-heum Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了专有和开源大语言模型在文档级自动后编辑（APE）任务中的表现，发现专有模型虽能达到近似人类水平的修正质量且鲁棒性更强，但难以有效利用文档上下文进行纠错，且成本与延迟过高，不适用于实际部署；自动指标无法可靠反映其质量提升，仍需人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）翻译能力强，但其在文档级自动后编辑（APE）中的有效性尚不明确，尤其在上下文利用、鲁棒性与实用性方面缺乏系统评估。

Method: 对专有和开源大语言模型在简单文档级提示（one-shot prompting）下进行系统对比实验，评估APE质量、上下文行为、抗数据污染攻击能力及推理效率。

Result: 专有LLMs在简单提示下即达近人类APE质量，鲁棒性优于开源模型，但几乎不利用文档上下文；自动指标与实际质量提升不一致；其高成本与高延迟阻碍实际部署。

Conclusion: LLM-based文档级APE潜力巨大但当前受限于上下文建模低效、评估不可靠及部署成本高，亟需更高效的长上下文建模方法。

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to refine machine translations by correcting residual errors. Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.
  Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement.

TL;DR: KG-CRAFT是一种结合知识图谱与对比问题的LLM增强方法，用于提升自动声明验证性能，在LIAR-RAW和RAWFC数据集上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自动声明验证的准确性，克服现有LLM在事实核查中缺乏结构化推理支持的问题。

Method: 构建声明与报告的知识图谱，基于图结构生成上下文相关的对比问题，引导证据提取与摘要生成，最终交由LLM进行真实性判断。

Result: 在LIAR-RAW和RAWFC两个真实数据集上取得新的最优预测性能，并通过详尽分析验证了知识图谱驱动的对比推理机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 知识图谱与对比问题的协同可显著增强LLM的事实核查能力，为自动化事实核查提供了新范式。

Abstract: Claim verification is a core component of automated fact-checking systems, aimed at determining the truthfulness of a statement by assessing it against reliable evidence sources such as documents or knowledge bases. This work presents KG-CRAFT, a method that improves automatic claim verification by leveraging large language models (LLMs) augmented with contrastive questions grounded in a knowledge graph. KG-CRAFT first constructs a knowledge graph from claims and associated reports, then formulates contextually relevant contrastive questions based on the knowledge graph structure. These questions guide the distillation of evidence-based reports, which are synthesised into a concise summary that is used for veracity assessment by LLMs. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets (LIAR-RAW and RAWFC) demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in predictive performance. Comprehensive analyses validate in detail the effectiveness of our knowledge graph-based contrastive reasoning approach in improving LLMs' fact-checking capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一投影器难以有效建模多语言场景下多样化的声学到语义映射关系，导致多语言ASR性能受限。

Method: 提出SMEAR-MoE——一种确保所有专家均获得稠密梯度、防止专家坍缩并支持跨语言共享的稳定混合专家投影器，并在四种印度语言上系统比较了单体、静态多投影器和动态MoE设计。

Result: SMEAR-MoE在四种Indic语言上相较单投影器基线取得最高7.6%的相对WER下降，运行效率相当；专家路由分析显示语言相关的专家专业化与共享模式。

Conclusion: 稳定的多专家投影器是实现可扩展、鲁棒多语言ASR的关键。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based ASR connect frozen speech encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) via lightweight projectors. While effective in monolingual settings, a single projector struggles to capture the diverse acoustic-to-semantic mappings required for multilingual ASR. To address this, we propose SMEAR-MoE, a stabilized Mixture-of-Experts projector that ensures dense gradient flow to all experts, preventing expert collapse while enabling cross-lingual sharing. We systematically compare monolithic, static multi-projector, and dynamic MoE designs across four Indic languages (Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu). Our SMEAR-MoE achieves strong performance, delivering upto a 7.6% relative WER reduction over the single-projector baseline, while maintaining comparable runtime efficiency. Analysis of expert routing further shows linguistically meaningful specialization, with related languages sharing experts. These results demonstrate that stable multi-expert projectors are key to scalable and robust multilingual ASR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 英语以外的语言（如葡萄牙语）缺乏可用、授权的标注数据集，限制了事实核查相关研究和NLP发展。

Method: 与葡萄牙通讯社LUSA合作收集新闻文章，由两名训练有素的标注员进行标注，并由一名审核员依据新提出的标注方案统一验证；同时提供基线模型用于声明检测任务。

Result: 构建了首个面向欧洲葡萄牙语新闻媒体的公开、授权的事实性声明标注数据集ClaimPT，含1308篇文章和6875个标注，并提供了初步的基线模型性能基准。

Conclusion: ClaimPT填补了葡萄牙语事实核查数据资源的空白，有助于促进低资源语言下的NLP研究及新闻中虚假信息的理解与应对。

Abstract: Fact-checking remains a demanding and time-consuming task, still largely dependent on manual verification and unable to match the rapid spread of misinformation online. This is particularly important because debunking false information typically takes longer to reach consumers than the misinformation itself; accelerating corrections through automation can therefore help counter it more effectively. Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content. These limitations have motivated interest in automating fact-checking, where identifying claims is a crucial first step. However, progress has been uneven across languages, with English dominating due to abundant annotated data. Portuguese, like other languages, still lacks accessible, licensed datasets, limiting research, NLP developments and applications. In this paper, we introduce ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, comprising 1,308 articles and 6,875 individual annotations. Unlike most existing resources based on social media or parliamentary transcripts, ClaimPT focuses on journalistic content, collected through a partnership with LUSA, the Portuguese News Agency. To ensure annotation quality, two trained annotators labeled each article, with a curator validating all annotations according to a newly proposed scheme. We also provide baseline models for claim detection, establishing initial benchmarks and enabling future NLP and IR applications. By releasing ClaimPT, we aim to advance research on low-resource fact-checking and enhance understanding of misinformation in news media.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出GradPruner方法，在LLM下游任务微调初期基于梯度信息（IGIA-Matrix）指导层剪枝，实现训练与推理双重高效；在8个数据集上达到40%参数压缩、仅0.99%精度下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM微调耗时昂贵，结构剪枝虽提升推理效率，但常需额外训练、知识蒸馏或结构搜索，难以兼顾训练与推理效率。

Method: 提出GradPruner：利用微调初期各参数累积梯度构建初始梯度信息累积矩阵（IGIA-Matrix）评估层重要性，据此剪枝并稀疏化剪枝层；仅合并同号元素以减少符号变化干扰，并与剩余层融合。

Result: 在两个LLM和八个下游数据集（含医疗、金融及通用基准）上实验表明，参数减少40%，准确率仅下降0.99%。

Conclusion: GradPruner能有效兼顾微调阶段的训练与推理效率，在保持高精度前提下显著压缩模型规模，是一种轻量、即插即用的高效微调策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with downstream data is often considered time-consuming and expensive. Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available.

Conclusion: VLSafetyBencher显著提升LVLM安全评估基准的构建效率与有效性，为动态、可扩展的安全评测提供新范式。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in cross-modal tasks but face significant safety challenges, which undermine their reliability in real-world applications. Efforts have been made to build LVLM safety evaluation benchmarks to uncover their vulnerability. However, existing benchmarks are hindered by their labor-intensive construction process, static complexity, and limited discriminative power. Thus, they may fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving models and emerging risks. To address these limitations, we propose VLSafetyBencher, the first automated system for LVLM safety benchmarking. VLSafetyBencher introduces four collaborative agents: Data Preprocessing, Generation, Augmentation, and Selection agents to construct and select high-quality samples. Experiments validates that VLSafetyBencher can construct high-quality safety benchmarks within one week at a minimal cost. The generated benchmark effectively distinguish safety, with a safety rate disparity of 70% between the most and least safe models.

Abstract: Deep research has emerged as a transformative capability for autonomous agents, empowering Large Language Models to navigate complex, open-ended tasks. However, realizing its full potential is hindered by critical limitations, including escalating contextual noise in long-horizon tasks, fragility leading to cascading errors, and a lack of modular extensibility. To address these challenges, we introduce Yunque DeepResearch, a hierarchical, modular, and robust framework. The architecture is characterized by three key components: (1) a centralized Multi-Agent Orchestration System that routes subtasks to an Atomic Capability Pool of tools and specialized sub-agents; (2) a Dynamic Context Management mechanism that structures completed sub-goals into semantic summaries to mitigate information overload; and (3) a proactive Supervisor Module that ensures resilience through active anomaly detection and context pruning. Yunque DeepResearch achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of agentic deep research benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp, BrowseComp-ZH, and Humanity's Last Exam. We open-source the framework, reproducible implementations, and application cases to empower the community.

*Xin Quan,Marco Valentino,Louise A. Dennis,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分解-形式化框架，用于提升自然语言推理（NLI）中大语言模型与定理证明器联合推理的准确性与效率，通过构建蕴含树、自底向上验证及局部诊断引导的精细化修正，显著提升解释验证率并减少迭代与运行开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号方法在处理自然化NLI时面临两大挑战：一是长而复杂的输入和多步推理易导致自动形式化错误；二是失败定位困难，常需代价高昂的全局重生成。

Method: 提出分解-形式化框架：(i) 将前提-假设对分解为蕴含树（含原子推理步骤）；(ii) 自底向上验证以精确定位失败节点；(iii) 基于定理证明器诊断进行局部精细化修正；并引入基于事件逻辑形式的θ-替换机制，确保论元角色绑定一致性。

Result: 在五种LLM主干模型上，该方法在多个推理任务中取得最高解释验证率，较SOTA分别提升26.2%、21.7%、21.6%和48.9%，同时降低细化迭代次数与运行时间，并保持强NLI准确率。

Conclusion: 分解-形式化与局部诊断引导的精细化策略可有效缓解自动形式化误差与失败定位难题，显著提升神经符号推理在自然化NLI中的可靠性与效率。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that integrating large language models (LLMs) with theorem provers (TPs) in neuro-symbolic pipelines helps with entailment verification and proof-guided refinement of explanations for natural language inference (NLI). However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $θ$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于视觉丰富文档关键信息抽取（KIE）的并行推理范式（PIP），通过[mask]标记实现多字段同时生成，显著提升推理速度（5-36倍），且精度几乎无损。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLMs）和多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的KIE方法依赖自回归推理，效率低，难以满足多字段独立抽取的实际需求。

Method: 提出并行推理范式PIP：用[mask]标记统一占位所有待抽取字段，实现单次前向传播同步生成；辅以定制化掩码预训练策略和大规模监督数据集构建。

Result: PIP模型在保持高准确率的同时，推理速度提升5–36倍，显著优于传统自回归基线模型。

Conclusion: PIP为KIE任务提供了高效、可扩展、实用的解决方案，推动其在真实场景中的落地应用。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) from visually-rich documents (VrDs) is a critical task, for which recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong potential. However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using "[mask]" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM时代下主题快速演变导致旧有基准过时，且代理信号难以真实反映评审人熟悉度，亟需更可靠、更新的评审人分配评估方法。

Method: 构建了基于2024–2025年AI/NLP手稿与专家自评熟悉度（五级）的LR-bench基准；提出RATE框架，通过抽取评审人近期论文生成关键词画像，并利用启发式检索信号构造弱偏好监督微调嵌入模型，实现稿件与评审人画像的直接匹配。

Result: 在LR-bench和CMU黄金标准数据集上，RATE持续达到SOTA性能，显著超越强嵌入基线。

Conclusion: LR-bench和RATE共同为评审人分配提供了高保真、时效性强的新范式，开源数据与代码促进该方向进一步发展。

Abstract: Reviewer assignment is increasingly critical yet challenging in the LLM era, where rapid topic shifts render many pre-2023 benchmarks outdated and where proxy signals poorly reflect true reviewer familiarity. We address this evaluation bottleneck by introducing LR-bench, a high-fidelity, up-to-date benchmark curated from 2024-2025 AI/NLP manuscripts with five-level self-assessed familiarity ratings collected via a large-scale email survey, yielding 1055 expert-annotated paper-reviewer-score annotations. We further propose RATE, a reviewer-centric ranking framework that distills each reviewer's recent publications into compact keyword-based profiles and fine-tunes an embedding model with weak preference supervision constructed from heuristic retrieval signals, enabling matching each manuscript against a reviewer profile directly. Across LR-bench and the CMU gold-standard dataset, our approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong embedding baselines by a clear margin. We release LR-bench at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gnociew/LR-bench, and a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Gnociew/RATE-Reviewer-Assign.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过添加一个特殊自注意的额外'sink' token来稳定扩散语言模型（DLMs）中‘移动sink’现象的方法，显著提升了模型推理鲁棒性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）存在‘移动sink’现象，即低范数的sink token在不同扩散步中位置不可预测，损害推理鲁棒性；尽管该现象具有一定保护作用（防止信息过度混合），但其不稳定性亟需解决。

Method: 引入一个额外的sink token，通过修改注意力掩码使其仅自注意、但对所有其他token全局可见，从而提供稳定、语义中性的结构化sink。

Result: 仅添加一个额外sink token即可显著稳定attention sink位置，提升DLM整体性能；实验证明该token效果与其位置无关，且几乎无语义内容，确证其作为结构性sink的有效性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该简单而有效的结构化sink机制为DLMs提供了关键稳定性保障，揭示了显式建模注意力sink对扩散文本生成的重要性，为后续DLM架构设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive approaches, enabling parallel text generation with competitive performance. Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型能否作为语言认知的计算模拟器，特别是能否被系统操控以复现局灶性脑损伤所致的失语症语言产出障碍，从而为康复假说检验和语言功能组织研究提供可扩展、受控的建模平台。

Method: 构建一个临床 grounded 的组件级失语模拟框架：（i）识别与布洛卡/韦尼克失语相关的模型内部功能组件；（ii）用语言探针任务解释这些组件；（iii）通过逐步扰动 top-k 相关组件诱导梯度损伤，并使用西方失语症量表（WAB）子测验及失语商（AQ）评估效果；在 MoE 和 dense Transformer 上统一实施。

Result: 靶向失语亚型相关组件的扰动比同等规模的随机扰动产生更系统、更类失语的语言退化；MoE 架构因其模块性展现出更强的定位性与组件-表型映射可解释性。

Conclusion: 模块化大语言模型结合临床指导的组件扰动，是模拟失语症语言产出障碍及研究语言功能在靶向破坏下退化机制的有力计算平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit human-like linguistic behaviors and internal representations that they could serve as computational simulators of language cognition. We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions.

TL;DR: 本文提出TokenSeek，一种针对Transformer模型的实例感知型token筛选与丢弃方法，显著降低大语言模型微调时的内存消耗（如在Llama3.2 1B上仅需14.8%内存），同时保持甚至提升性能，并提供可解释的token效率分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活优化方法多为数据无关，导致微调效率低且不稳定；而激活内存占用是LLM微调中内存瓶颈的主要来源。

Method: 提出TokenSeek，通过实例感知的token seeking（筛选重要token）和ditching（丢弃冗余token），作为即插即用模块适配各类Transformer模型。

Result: 在Llama3.2 1B等模型上实现仅14.8%内存占用的高效微调，性能持平或更优；并揭示了token层面的可解释性规律。

Conclusion: TokenSeek是一种通用、高效、可解释的内存优化方案，为大模型轻量微调和token效率研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine tuning has been regarded as a de facto approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but the high training memory consumption inherited from LLMs makes this process inefficient. Among existing memory efficient approaches, activation-related optimization has proven particularly effective, as activations consistently dominate overall memory consumption. Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向交互式医疗咨询的评估框架，引入信息覆盖率（ICR）指标，并构建了基于证据的基准数据集EviMed；发现诊断推理强不等于信息收集能力强，进而提出REFINE策略以诊断验证引导不确定性消除，显著提升交互性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗咨询评估多为静态或结果导向，忽视证据采集过程，难以反映真实交互中主动获取临床证据的能力。

Method: 构建基于原子证据的模拟患者与模拟报告者；提出信息覆盖率（ICR）量化证据采集完整性；建立覆盖常见与罕见疾病的证据型基准EviMed；提出REFINE策略，利用诊断验证反馈指导不确定性消除。

Result: 实验表明强诊断推理模型在信息收集上表现不足，是交互性能瓶颈；REFINE策略在多个数据集上持续优于基线，并支持小模型在强推理监督下实现更优性能。

Conclusion: 证据采集能力是交互式医疗咨询的关键短板，需独立建模与优化；REFINE策略有效弥合诊断推理与信息收集之间的鸿沟，为构建实用化医疗对话代理提供新路径。

Abstract: Interactive medical consultation requires an agent to proactively elicit missing clinical evidence under uncertainty. Yet existing evaluations largely remain static or outcome-centric, neglecting the evidence-gathering process. In this work, we propose an interactive evaluation framework that explicitly models the consultation process using a simulated patient and a \rev{simulated reporter} grounded in atomic evidences. Based on this representation, we introduce Information Coverage Rate (ICR) to quantify how completely an agent uncovers necessary evidence during interaction. To support systematic study, we build EviMed, an evidence-based benchmark spanning diverse conditions from common complaints to rare diseases, and evaluate 10 models with varying reasoning abilities. We find that strong diagnostic reasoning does not guarantee effective information collection, and this insufficiency acts as a primary bottleneck limiting performance in interactive settings. To address this, we propose REFINE, a strategy that leverages diagnostic verification to guide the agent in proactively resolving uncertainties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms baselines across diverse datasets and facilitates effective model collaboration, enabling smaller agents to achieve superior performance under strong reasoning supervision.

TL;DR: 本文通过指称通信实验，揭示了多模态大模型（LVLMs）在交互式解决指称表达任务中的局限性，强调其缺乏对共同知识（common ground）建模的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI代理需准确预测人类意图以实现有效人机协作，但当前受限于无法建模共同知识（common ground）。

Method: 设计了包含四类配对（人-人、人-AI、AI-人、AI-AI）的指称通信实验，采用多轮重复交互方式，要求参与者匹配无明确词汇标签的图片；并发布了数据采集流程、分析工具及含356段对话的语料库。

Result: 发现LVLMs在交互式指称表达消解任务中表现明显弱于人类，尤其在准确性、效率和词汇重叠度方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LVLMs缺乏对共同知识的动态建模能力，是其难以实现真正人机协作的关键瓶颈，需在后续研究中重点突破。

Abstract: For generative AI agents to partner effectively with human users, the ability to accurately predict human intent is critical. But this ability to collaborate remains limited by a critical deficit: an inability to model common ground. Here, we present a referential communication experiment with a factorial design involving director-matcher pairs (human-human, human-AI, AI-human, and AI-AI) that interact with multiple turns in repeated rounds to match pictures of objects not associated with any obvious lexicalized labels. We release the online pipeline for data collection, the tools and analyses for accuracy, efficiency, and lexical overlap, and a corpus of 356 dialogues (89 pairs over 4 rounds each) that unmasks LVLMs' limitations in interactively resolving referring expressions, a crucial skill that underlies human language use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场检测方法依赖于预定义、静态的目标，难以应对真实社交媒体中目标复杂动态的特点。

Method: 提出DGTA新任务（动态目标生成与多目标适配），构建中文社交立场检测数据集，设计多维评估指标，并探索大语言模型的集成微调与两阶段微调策略。

Result: 两阶段微调Qwen2.5-7B在目标识别综合得分达66.99%；集成微调DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B在立场检测F1达79.26%。

Conclusion: 微调大语言模型能有效解决零样本、多目标、动态目标的立场检测问题，DGTA任务更具现实意义和挑战性。

Abstract: Current stance detection research typically relies on predicting stance based on given targets and text. However, in real-world social media scenarios, targets are neither predefined nor static but rather complex and dynamic. To address this challenge, we propose a novel task: zero-shot stance detection in the wild with Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation (DGTA), which aims to automatically identify multiple target-stance pairs from text without prior target knowledge. We construct a Chinese social media stance detection dataset and design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. We explore both integrated and two-stage fine-tuning strategies for large language models (LLMs) and evaluate various baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance on this task: the two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B attains the highest comprehensive target recognition score of 66.99%, while the integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a stance detection F1 score of 79.26%.

TL;DR: 本文提出AdaRAS，一种轻量级测试时干预框架，通过识别并自适应调控与推理正确性高度相关的少数关键神经元（RCNs），显著提升大语言模型在数学与编程任务上的推理可靠性，无需额外训练或采样开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型虽具强推理能力，但常需后训练或高成本采样策略才能获得可靠性能，限制了实际效率。

Method: 基于发现少量神经元与推理正确性存在强预测相关性，提出AdaRAS：利用极性感知的均值差异准则识别Reasoning-Critical Neurons（RCNs），并在推理时选择性地干预其激活，增强错误推理路径而不损害已正确的结果。

Result: 在10个数学与编程基准上持续提升性能，AIME-24和AIME-25上提升超13%；具备跨数据集迁移性和对更强模型的可扩展性，优于各类后训练方法，且无额外训练或采样成本。

Conclusion: AdaRAS验证了通过精细、自适应的测试时神经元干预可高效提升LLM推理可靠性，为轻量、免训练的推理优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on challenging tasks often requires post-training or computationally expensive sampling strategies, limiting their practical efficiency. In this work, we first show that a small subset of neurons in LLMs exhibits strong predictive correlations with reasoning correctness. Based on this observation, we propose AdaRAS (Adaptive Reasoning Activation Steering), a lightweight test-time framework that improves reasoning reliability by selectively intervening on neuron activations. AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25. Moreover, AdaRAS exhibits strong transferability across datasets and scalability to stronger models, outperforming post-training methods without additional training or sampling cost.

*Nicholas Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“反思式翻译（Reflective Translation）”的提示框架，通过让大语言模型自动生成初始翻译、结构化自我批评，并据此修正翻译，在英语-祖鲁语和英语-科萨语低资源翻译任务中显著提升了BLEU和COMET得分，且无需微调、模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言（如isiZulu和isiXhosa）因平行语料和语言资源匮乏，机器翻译性能长期受限；而大模型的自反思能力已被证明可提升推理质量与事实一致性，值得迁移至翻译任务。

Method: 提出Reflective Translation框架：模型先生成初始翻译，再生成结构化自我批评（含错误类型、位置、修正建议），最后基于该反思生成优化后的翻译；在OPUS-100和NTREX-African数据集上测试多种提示策略与置信度阈值。

Result: 在英语-isiZulu和英语-isiXhosa翻译任务中，二遍翻译相比一遍翻译平均提升+0.22 BLEU和+0.18 COMET，配对非参数检验表明结果具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 结构化自反思是一种实用且有效的机制，可在不依赖微调和特定模型的前提下，显著提升低资源语言翻译质量；所构建的反思增强型数据集亦可支撑后续监督学习或分析研究。

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDTBs在肿瘤决策中至关重要，但人工处理大量异构临床信息导致繁重的文档负担。

Method: 构建模块化、安全的ONCOTIMIA系统，整合生成式AI，采用多层数据湖、混合关系/向量存储、检索增强生成（RAG）和规则驱动的自适应表单模型，将非结构化临床文档转为标准化结构化记录；在AWS Bedrock上评估6个LLM在10例肺癌病例中的表单自动填充准确率与端到端延迟。

Result: 最佳配置实现80%字段正确填充，多数LLM响应时间符合临床可接受水平；更大、更新的模型精度更高且延迟未达不可接受程度。

Conclusion: LLM辅助表单自动填充在肺癌多学科工作流中具备技术可行性与操作可行性，有望显著减轻文档负担并维持数据质量。

Abstract: Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTBs) play a central role in oncology decision-making but require manual processes and structuring large volumes of heterogeneous clinical information, resulting in a substantial documentation burden. In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 三轴磁力计分量随传感器姿态变化，但IGRF总强度保持不变；需设计对姿态变化鲁棒的预测方法。

Method: 利用旋转不变标量特征，并设计Canonical SPD模块：基于每窗口Gram矩阵构建规范坐标系，在原始坐标系中进行状态依赖的谱缩放，以稳定窗口级二阶矩谱并避免符号不连续。

Result: 在五次飞行实验中，NavFormer在标准训练、少样本训练和零样本迁移任务上均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: NavFormer通过规范SPD模块实现了对传感器姿态变化的鲁棒性，在IGRF总强度预测任务中展现出优异泛化能力。

Abstract: Triad magnetometer components change with sensor attitude even when the IGRF total intensity target stays invariant. NavFormer forecasts this invariant target with rotation invariant scalar features and a Canonical SPD module that stabilizes the spectrum of window level second moments of the triads without sign discontinuities. The module builds a canonical frame from a Gram matrix per window and applies state dependent spectral scaling in the original coordinates. Experiments across five flights show lower error than strong baselines in standard training, few shot training, and zero shot transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在无需预设统计假设（如线性、平稳性）或特定下游目标，从多变量时间序列中自动发现可解释的潜在关系结构。

Method: 使用无监督序列到序列自编码器学习窗口级表示，聚合为实体级嵌入，并通过潜空间相似度阈值化构建稀疏相似性网络。

Result: 在小时级加密货币收益真实数据集上验证了该方法能生成具有凝聚结构的网络，并通过经典计量关系作为外部诊断工具解释所发现边的合理性。

Conclusion: 该发现层提供了一种可分析、可压缩的关系抽象，聚焦于探索性关系发现而非预测或决策优化。

Abstract: This paper proposes a task-agnostic discovery layer for multivariate time series that constructs a relational hypothesis graph over entities without assuming linearity, stationarity, or a downstream objective. The method learns window-level sequence representations using an unsupervised sequence-to-sequence autoencoder, aggregates these representations into entity-level embeddings, and induces a sparse similarity network by thresholding a latent-space similarity measure. This network is intended as an analyzable abstraction that compresses the pairwise search space and exposes candidate relationships for further investigation, rather than as a model optimized for prediction, trading, or any decision rule. The framework is demonstrated on a challenging real-world dataset of hourly cryptocurrency returns, illustrating how latent similarity induces coherent network structure; a classical econometric relation is also reported as an external diagnostic lens to contextualize discovered edges.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于变分量子电路的量子强化学习（QRL）方法，用于动态投资组合优化，并在真实金融数据上验证其风险调整后表现可媲美甚至超越参数量大几个数量级的经典深度强化学习模型；虽当前受限于云量子硬件的延迟，但QRL展现出更高的参数效率与跨市场环境的鲁棒性，具有理论竞争力和未来应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态投资组合优化这一高维、非平稳环境下的复杂决策问题，探索量子强化学习相较于经典方法的潜在优势，特别是在参数效率和鲁棒性方面。

Method: 设计并实现了基于变分量子电路的量子强化学习算法，作为经典深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）和深度Q网络（DQN）的量子类比，应用于动态投资组合优化任务。

Result: 量子智能体在真实金融数据上实现了与经典深度RL模型相当甚至更优的风险调整后收益，参数量少几个数量级，且在不同市场环境下表现更稳定；但受限于当前云量子平台的高延迟，端到端运行时间仍不具实用优势。

Conclusion: QRL在理论上已具备与前沿经典强化学习相竞争的能力，尤其适合复杂、高维、非平稳环境（如金融市场）；其实用价值将随量子硬件部署开销降低而提升。

Abstract: This paper presents a Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) solution to the dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on Variational Quantum Circuits. The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于超球面坐标的变分自编码器（VAE）潜变量建模方法，以解决高维潜空间中异常检测困难的问题，显著提升了无监督和分布外（OOD）异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准VAE在高维潜空间中存在潜向量分布在超球面‘赤道’区域的问题，导致异常检测能力下降；同时高维超体积指数增长也削弱了生成能力。

Method: 将VAE的潜变量用超球面坐标表示，使潜向量能压缩到超球面上的特定方向，从而构建更具表达力的近似后验分布。

Result: 在火星探测车图像、地面天文图像等复杂真实数据集上实现了最优的无监督异常检测效果；在CIFAR-10和ImageNet子集等标准OOD基准上也超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 超球面坐标建模有效缓解了高维潜空间带来的异常检测难题，提升了VAE在无监督与OOD两种场景下的鲁棒性与实用性。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为交互式投影聚类（IPBC）的新框架，将聚类重构为一种人机协同的可视化分析过程，通过用户反馈动态优化非线性投影，并提升低维聚类效果与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据聚类困难，传统降维方法生成静态嵌入、缺乏可解释性，且无法融合人类直觉进行探索。

Method: 提出IPBC框架，结合非线性投影模块与用户反馈回路（如调整视角、添加must-link/cannot-link约束），动态优化嵌入；在优化后的2D布局上运行常规聚类算法，并通过可解释组件将聚类结果映射回原始特征空间生成规则或特征排序。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，仅需少量交互步骤即可显著提升聚类质量。

Conclusion: IPBC实现了机器表征能力与人类洞察力的协同增强，使聚类成为一种协作式发现过程。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.

*Yaohua Zha,Chunlin Fan,Peiyuan Liu,Yong Jiang,Tao Dai,Hai Wu,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向多通道时间序列预测的通道感知损失函数（CP Loss），通过为每个通道学习适配其特性的感知空间，并在该空间内计算损失，以提升对通道特有动态（如剧烈波动、趋势变化）的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型使用通道无关的损失函数（如MSE），难以捕捉多通道时间序列中各通道特有的动态特性（如尖锐波动或趋势突变）。

Method: 提出通道感知损失（CP Loss）：设计可学习的通道专用滤波器，将原始信号分解为解耦的多尺度表征，构建通道专属感知空间；该滤波器与主预测模型联合优化，确保感知空间服务于预测任务；最终在各通道感知空间内计算损失。

Result: CP Loss能更有效地捕捉通道特有动态，在多通道时间序列预测任务上提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 通道感知损失是一种有效提升多通道时间序列预测精度的新范式，强调损失函数应适配数据的通道异质性。

Abstract: Multi-channel time-series data, prevalent across diverse applications, is characterized by significant heterogeneity in its different channels. However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model. Code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CP_Loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了CNN与多种RNN结构（LSTM、GRU、BiLSTM及其堆叠变体）在PTB-XL数据集上用于多标签心电图分类的性能，发现CNN+单层BiLSTM在性能与复杂度间取得最佳平衡，更深的RNN结构收益递减且易过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多采用深层/堆叠循环网络，但其必要性与临床合理性缺乏严格检验；ECG多标签分类面临多病共存、类别不平衡和长程时序依赖等挑战。

Method: 在PTB-XL数据集（23类诊断）上，以CNN为形态学基线，逐步引入不同RNN结构（LSTM、GRU、BiLSTM及堆叠版本）进行系统对比实验，评估其对时序建模与泛化能力的贡献。

Result: CNN+单层BiLSTM取得最优综合指标：Hamming损失0.0338、macro-AUPRC 0.4715、micro-F1 0.6979、子集准确率0.5723；堆叠RNN仅在个别稀有类别上提升召回，但整体精度下降、泛化减弱。

Conclusion: ECG分类性能的关键在于模型架构与信号内在时序结构的匹配，而非单纯增加RNN深度；CNN+单层BiLSTM更适于临床部署。

Abstract: Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展测试时计算资源以提升长链式推理能力时，面临高训练成本或生成冗余推理路径的权衡问题。

Method: TGR采用无训练框架，在每个分块边界处利用轻量级前视估计结合软几何正则项对候选潜在锚点打分，鼓励平滑且多样化的推理路径；并通过分块式KV缓存重置确保内存消耗与分块长度呈线性关系。

Result: 在数学与代码基准测试中，TGR将Pass@$k$曲线下的面积（AUC）最高提升13个点（Qwen3-8B模型），额外开销仅约1.1–1.3倍。

Conclusion: TGR在不增加训练负担的前提下，实现了高效、鲁棒且内存友好的长链式推理增强，为测试时计算缩放提供了新范式。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.

*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了HaKAN模型，一种基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KAN）并采用Hahn多项式可学习激活函数的轻量级、可解释的多变量时间序列预测方法，通过通道独立性、分块策略、残差连接的Hahn-KAN模块及瓶颈结构，在多个基准上超越现有SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在长时序预测中因二次复杂度和置换等变注意力导致的效率与建模局限，以及MLP存在的谱偏差问题。

Method: 提出HaKAN模型：基于KAN架构，引入Hahn多项式作为可学习激活函数；结合通道独立、时间序列分块、堆叠的Hahn-KAN块（含组内/组间KAN层）、残差连接与双层全连接瓶颈结构。

Result: 在多个长期时间序列预测基准上持续优于近期SOTA方法；消融实验验证了Hahn激活函数、KAN结构、分块与瓶颈设计等核心组件的有效性。

Conclusion: HaKAN为时间序列预测提供了一种兼具高性能、低复杂度与强可解释性的新范式，凸显了基于正交多项式激活的KAN架构在时序建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Transformer- and MLP-based models have demonstrated strong performance in long-term time series forecasting, yet Transformers remain limited by their quadratic complexity and permutation-equivariant attention, while MLPs exhibit spectral bias. We propose HaKAN, a versatile model based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), leveraging Hahn polynomial-based learnable activation functions and providing a lightweight and interpretable alternative for multivariate time series forecasting. Our model integrates channel independence, patching, a stack of Hahn-KAN blocks with residual connections, and a bottleneck structure comprised of two fully connected layers. The Hahn-KAN block consists of inter- and intra-patch KAN layers to effectively capture both global and local temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on various forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its core components.

TL;DR: 本文建立了控制贝尔曼残差最小化（control Bellman residual minimization）用于策略优化的基础理论结果，弥补了该方法在控制任务中研究不足的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝尔曼残差最小化虽在策略评估中被广泛研究，但在策略优化（即控制任务）中却鲜有探索；同时，其在函数逼近下具有更稳定的收敛性等优势，值得深入研究。

Method: 建立控制贝尔曼残差最小化的理论基础，聚焦于策略优化任务。

Result: 为控制任务中的贝尔曼残差最小化方法提供了 foundational results（基础性成果）。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了贝尔曼残差方法在控制领域理论研究的空白，为后续模型无关的强化学习扩展提供了潜在基础。

Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.

### [133] [Representational Homomorphism Predicts and Improves Compositional Generalization In Transformer Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18858)
*Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为同态误差（Homomorphism Error, HE）的结构性度量，用于量化神经网络在组合泛化任务中隐藏表征空间与表达代数之间近似同态关系的偏差；HE能有效预测模型在分布外（OOD）组合泛化上的性能，并可作为正则化信号提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在组合泛化上表现不佳，行为评估只能揭示失败现象，难以解释表征层面的根本原因；需一种能刻画表征结构缺陷的可解释、可计算的度量。

Method: 定义并实例化两种HE：修饰符HE（对应一元组合）和序列HE（对应二元组合），通过学习表征级算子来预测组合后的隐状态；在SCAN风格任务上对小型decoder-only Transformer开展控制实验，并引入HE正则化训练。

Result: HE与OOD准确率高度相关（R²=0.73）；数据覆盖不足会显著增大HE并损害OOD性能；噪声token系统性增加HE；HE正则化训练显著降低两类HE并提升OOD准确率（p<0.05）。

Conclusion: HE是一种兼具诊断价值与优化指导意义的结构性指标，有望成为提升组合泛化的关键工具。

Abstract: Compositional generalization-the ability to interpret novel combinations of familiar components-remains a persistent challenge for neural networks. Behavioral evaluations reveal when models fail but offer limited insight into why failures arise at the representational level. We introduce Homomorphism Error (HE), a structural metric that quantifies deviations from approximate homomorphisms between the expression algebra and a model's hidden-state space. We instantiate HE for two compositional operators in SCAN-style tasks: modifier HE for unary composition and sequence HE for binary composition, measured by learning representation-level operators that predict composed representations from their parts. Across controlled experiments with small decoder-only Transformers, HE predicts out-of-distribution (OOD) compositional generalization under noise injection, achieving R^2 = 0.73 correlation between modifier HE and OOD accuracy. Ablations show that model depth has minimal effect on either HE or OOD accuracy, training data coverage exhibits threshold effects (insufficient coverage sharply increases HE and degrades OOD performance), and randomly inserted noise tokens systematically increase HE. Finally, we test if HE-regularized training improves OOD accuracy. Experiment shows that explicitly enforcing low modifier HE during training significantly reduces modifier HE (p = 1.1x10-4) and sequence HE (p = 0.001) and yields a statistically significant improvement in OOD accuracy (p = 0.023). Together, these results indicate the potential of HE to be both a diagnostic and an actionable training signal for improving compositional generalization. Code to reproduce our experiments is open-sourced.

### [134] [How Is Uncertainty Propagated in Knowledge Distillation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18909)
*Ziyao Cui,Jian Pei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了知识蒸馏中不确定性传播问题，区分了学生间和学生内不确定性，并提出了两种方差感知策略（教师响应平均和方差加权）以提升蒸馏稳定性与保真度，涵盖线性回归、神经网络和大语言模型三类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏过程具有内在随机性（教师输出、学生训练与推理均可能随机），而传统方法将多重不确定性压缩为单一确定性估计，易导致学习失真。

Method: 区分inter-student与intra-student不确定性；提出两种方差感知策略：(1) 多次采样教师响应并平均，降噪速率为O(1/k)；(2) 基于逆方差加权融合师生预测，构造最小方差估计；在三类模型上进行理论分析与实验验证。

Result: 在线性回归中给出形式化保证；在神经网络和LLM上验证有效性；显著降低LLM蒸馏中的系统性噪声与幻觉，提升学生模型稳定性与对教师不确定性的建模能力。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏应被重新理解为一种不确定性变换过程；引入方差感知机制可使学生模型更鲁棒、更忠实地继承教师的不确定性结构。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation transfers behavior from a teacher to a student model, but the process is inherently stochastic: teacher outputs, student training, and student inference can all be random. Collapsing these uncertainties to a single point estimate can distort what is learned. We systematically study how uncertainty propagates through knowledge distillation across three representative model classes--linear regression, feed-forward neural networks, and large language models (LLMs)--and propose simple corrections. We distinguish inter-student uncertainty (variance across independently distilled students) from intra-student uncertainty (variance of a single student's predictive distribution), showing that standard single-response knowledge distillation suppresses intra-student variance while leaving substantial inter-student variability. To address these mismatches, we introduce two variance-aware strategies: averaging multiple teacher responses, which reduces noise at rate $O(1/k)$, and variance-weighting, which combines teacher and student estimates via inverse-variance weighting to yield a minimum-variance estimator. We provide formal guarantees in linear regression, validate the methods in neural networks, and demonstrate empirical gains in LLM distillation, including reduced systematic noise and hallucination. These results reframe knowledge distillation as an uncertainty transformation and show that variance-aware distillation produces more stable students that better reflect teacher uncertainty.

### [135] [ASEHybrid: When Geometry Matters Beyond Homophily in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18912)
*Shalima Binta Manir,Tim Oates*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于标签信息量（Label Informativeness, LI）的统一理论框架，解释了图结构何时真正有助于节点分类，并设计了几何感知架构ASEHybrid；理论证明了图结构提升性能的充要条件是其携带了超越节点特征的标签相关信息，实验验证其在标签信息丰富但异质性强的图上有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准GNN在低同质性图上表现差，但同质性本身不足以解释性能差异；部分异质图仍易处理，说明需更本质的判据——标签信息量（LI）被提出作为更准确刻画图结构有用性的指标。

Method: 构建以标签信息量为核心的统一理论框架，关联曲率引导重连与位置几何；设计几何感知GNN架构ASEHybrid，结合Forman曲率与拉普拉斯位置编码；理论分析涵盖谱行为、表达能力限制、重连收敛性与Lipschitz稳定性。

Result: 理论证明：几何感知GNN优于纯特征基线的充要条件是图结构提供超出节点特征的标签相关信息；实验证明ASEHybrid在Chameleon、Squirrel等标签信息丰富但异质的图上显著提升性能，在高基线场景无明显增益。

Conclusion: 标签信息量（LI）是比同质性更根本的图结构有效性判据；几何感知建模（如曲率+位置编码）仅在LI较高时带来增益，验证了‘结构有用性’的本质在于其是否承载额外标签信息。

Abstract: Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.

*Semih Cantürk,Andrei Manolache,Arman Mielke,Chendi Qian,Antoine Siraudin,Christopher Morris,Mathias Niepert,Guy Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了神经图逆问题（GraIP）概念框架，将多种图学习任务统一建模为逆问题，旨在从观测数据中反演底层图结构，而非在给定图上做预测；该框架涵盖重连、因果发现、神经关系推理等任务，并提供了基准数据集、评估指标及基线方法分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图学习方法（如结构发现、时序图分析、组合优化）多为任务特定设计，缺乏统一理论基础，难以促进方法间迁移与协同。

Method: 提出神经图逆问题（GraIP）框架，将图结构推断形式化为逆问题：基于观测输出（如节点状态），通过逆转前向过程（如消息传递或网络动力学）来恢复未知图结构；并构建对应任务的基准数据集与评估指标。

Result: 验证了GraIP在图重连、因果发现、神经关系推理等任务上的通用性；系统梳理并实证评估了现有基线方法；建立了可复现的基准体系。

Conclusion: GraIP为图结构学习提供了统一、原理性的理论视角，弥合了不同应用间的隔阂，推动了约束性与组合性场景下结构学习的方法融合与进一步发展。

Abstract: A wide range of graph learning tasks, such as structure discovery, temporal graph analysis, and combinatorial optimization, focus on inferring graph structures from data, rather than making predictions on given graphs. However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them. Overall, our unifying perspective bridges seemingly disparate applications and provides a principled approach to structural learning in constrained and combinatorial settings while encouraging cross-pollination of existing methods across graph inverse problems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于零售链库存规划的两阶段预测-优化方法，在VN2挑战赛中获得第一名。该方法结合全局多步长预测模型（基于CatBoost的梯度提升树）与成本感知订货策略，通过缺货感知特征工程、逐序列缩放和时间加权训练，提升预测准确性，并在决策阶段显式权衡缺货与持有成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零售链库存规划需将需求预测转化为订货决策，且需处理不对称的缺货与持有成本；VN2挑战赛为此设定了具有两周交货期的周级决策场景。

Method: 采用两阶段predict-then-optimize流程：第一阶段使用全局多步长CatBoost模型进行需求预测，引入缺货感知特征、逐序列缩放和时间加权；第二阶段基于预测结果投影库存并计算兼顾短缺与持有成本的目标库存水平。

Result: 在VN2官方六轮仿真评测中获得第一名，验证了强全局预测模型与轻量成本感知策略组合的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于VN2设定，还可扩展至真实世界应用及更多运营约束场景。

Abstract: Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints.

### [138] [Toward Learning POMDPs Beyond Full-Rank Actions and State Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18930)
*Seiji Shaw,Travis Manderson,Chad Kessens,Nicholas Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）中学习隐藏状态、转移和观测模型的新方法，通过扩展预测状态表示（PSR）并结合张量分解，在不假设完全状态可观测或满秩转移矩阵的前提下，估计出可被下游规划器直接使用的观测与转移概率矩阵（至状态划分等价）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么能估计隐藏状态数但无法获得转移/观测概率（如PSR），要么需强假设（如全状态可观测、所有动作的转移矩阵满秩）才能估计概率；而实际场景（如带隐藏锁具的家具）要求在弱假设下同时学习结构与概率以支持下游推理与规划。

Method: 基于PSR框架，分析其对转移和观测矩阵的相似变换不变性，利用张量分解估计这些矩阵至状态划分等价类；即同一划分内状态具有相同动作下的观测分布，且仅对具有满秩转移矩阵的动作有效。

Result: 实验表明，在数据充分时，所学的划分级转移模型性能媲美标准PSR，且显式输出的观测与转移概率可直接用于采样式POMDP求解器，并支持规划行为定制。

Conclusion: 该方法在放宽关键假设的同时，兼顾了隐藏状态识别与可解释的概率建模，为自主智能体在真实部分可观测系统中的学习与推理提供了更实用的建模途径。

Abstract: We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯Copula和边缘嵌入的可扩展图神经网络方法（CopulaGNN扩展），用于有符号图中的链接符号预测，通过Gramian表示相关矩阵和重定义条件概率分布，显著降低计算开销并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络依赖同质性假设，难以直接处理含负边的有符号图；需建模边之间的潜在统计依赖关系，但朴素建模计算不可行。

Method: 1）用边缘嵌入的Gramian矩阵近似高斯Copula的相关矩阵，减少参数量；2）重构条件概率分布以降低推理成本；理论证明线性收敛性。

Result: 实验表明该方法比基线模型收敛更快，同时在预测性能上与当前最优模型具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提方法在保证预测精度的同时显著提升训练效率，为有符号图上的链接符号预测提供了高效、可扩展的新范式。

Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个受网络资源分配启发的双层在线配置与调度问题，通过上层在线凸优化（OCO）与下层约束马尔可夫决策过程（CMDP）建模，并提出一种新算法解决切换成本与跨层约束下的联合学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCO忽略系统状态动态（如队列演化），而CMDP通常假设固定约束阈值，无法适应预算在线变化；实际网络资源配置需协同慢速配置与快速调度，且存在预算重配成本和预算-调度耦合约束。

Method: 提出双层OCO-CMDP联合学习框架：上层采用带对偶反馈（返回预算乘子作为敏感度信息）的OCO更新；下层通过扩展的占用测度线性规划实现预算自适应的安全探索。

Result: 理论证明所提算法具有近似最优遗憾界，并以高概率满足跨层约束。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了状态感知OCO与动态约束CMDP之间的理论空白，为两时间尺度网络资源管理提供了可证明性能保障的新方法。

Abstract: We study a bi-level online provisioning and scheduling problem motivated by network resource allocation, where provisioning decisions are made at a slow time scale while queue-/state-dependent scheduling is performed at a fast time scale. We model this two-time-scale interaction using an upper-level online convex optimization (OCO) problem and a lower-level constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Existing OCO typically assumes stateless decisions and thus cannot capture MDP network dynamics such as queue evolution. Meanwhile, CMDP algorithms typically assume a fixed constraint threshold, whereas in provisioning-and-scheduling systems, the threshold varies with online budget decisions. To address these gaps, we study bi-level OCO-CMDP learning under switching costs (budget reprovisioning/system reconfiguration) and cross-level constraints that couple budgets to scheduling decisions. Our new algorithm solves this learning problem via several non-trivial developments, including a carefully designed dual feedback that returns the budget multiplier as sensitivity information for the upper-level update and a lower level that solves a budget-adaptive safe exploration problem via an extended occupancy-measure linear program. We establish near-optimal regret and high-probability satisfaction of the cross-level constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出FSD-CAP，一种两阶段图节点特征缺失填补框架，在极高缺失率（99.5%）下仍能实现接近全特征输入的节点分类与链路预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于潜在表示或全局扩散的方法在高缺失率下可靠性差，易在图中传播误差。

Method: 第一阶段：图距离引导的子图扩展 + 分数阶扩散算子（自适应调整传播锐度）；第二阶段：类感知传播（融合伪标签和邻域熵以提升一致性）。

Result: 在99.5%特征缺失下，节点分类准确率达80.06%–81.01%，接近全特征GCN的81.31%；链路预测AUC达91.65%–92.41%，接近全观测的95.06%；在大规模及异质性图上也优于其他模型。

Conclusion: FSD-CAP通过局部化、自适应扩散与类感知精调，显著提升了极端稀疏场景下的节点特征插补质量与下游任务性能。

Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.

Motivation: 传统大语言模型行为对齐依赖全模型微调，易引发分布偏移和可解释性差等问题，亟需更精准、高效、低数据依赖的对齐方法。

Method: 结合稀疏自编码器（SAEs）与线性探针定位对目标行为最具预测性的前3% MLP神经元，将其解码至残差空间，并通过梯度掩码仅更新这些神经元。

Result: 在Gemmma-2-2B/9B模型上针对减少谄媚行为任务，在Syco-Bench、NLP、POLI、PHIL四个基准上达到或超越SOTA性能，且仅需少量数据。

Conclusion: 稀疏、神经元级别的微调是一种可扩展、高精度、低数据依赖的替代方案，优于传统全模型微调。

Abstract: Behavioral alignment in large language models (LLMs) is often achieved through broad fine-tuning, which can result in undesired side effects like distributional shift and low interpretability. We propose a method for alignment that identifies and updates only the neurons most responsible for a given behavior, a targeted approach that allows for fine-tuning with significantly less data. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models. Our results show that sparse, neuron-level updates offer a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even in situations when little data is available

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于希尔伯特空间映射的离线多维分布强化学习框架（KE-DRL），通过核均值嵌入估计多维价值分布，避免了计算困难的Wasserstein距离，理论上有收敛保证，实验表明其在离线策略评估中表现稳健。

Abstract: We propose an (offline) multi-dimensional distributional reinforcement learning framework (KE-DRL) that leverages Hilbert space mappings to estimate the kernel mean embedding of the multi-dimensional value distribution under a proposed target policy. In our setting, the state-action variables are multi-dimensional and continuous. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees. Simulations and empirical results demonstrate robust off-policy evaluation and recovery of the kernel mean embedding under mild assumptions, namely, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the kernels, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches in complex real-world decision-making scenarios and risk evaluation.

*Utkarsh Pratiush,Austin Houston,Richard Liu,Gerd Duscher,Sergei Kalinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多目标贝叶斯优化（MOBO）框架，用于高效、数据驱动地校正扫描透射电子显微镜（STEM）中的像差，兼顾多种物理指标与实验权衡，实现动态自优化成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高通量像差校正需快速调谐多极探针校正器并补偿光学柱漂移，但传统串行无梯度搜索效率低、灵活性差，而深度学习方法缺乏适应不同样品条件的泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于高斯过程回归的多目标贝叶斯优化（MOBO）框架，支持用户定义物理驱动的奖励函数（如对称性指标），利用Pareto前沿揭示多目标权衡，并通过主动学习选择最具信息量的透镜参数组合进行评估。

Result: 该方法在聚焦、像散及高阶像差校正中比传统算法更鲁棒，显著提升数据效率与适应性，实现实验过程中性能的动态维持与自优化。

Conclusion: MOBO框架为像差校正提供了灵活、高效、可解释的替代方案，推动STEM向智能化、自动化高通量原子尺度表征迈进。

Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.

*Nima Leclerc,Chris Miller,Nicholas Brawand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个元学习的缩放定律下界，用于量化自适应控制中任务特异性梯度更新带来的性能增益，并验证其在量子门校准和经典线性二次控制中的普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子硬件存在固有的设备异质性和环境漂移问题，导致非自适应控制器性能次优，而逐设备重校准成本高昂，亟需一种可量化的自适应决策准则。

Method: 推导元学习的缩放律下界，刻画适应增益（即任务特定梯度步带来的期望保真度提升）与梯度步数及任务方差的关系；并在量子门校准与经典线性二次控制任务上进行实验验证。

Result: 适应增益随梯度步数呈指数饱和，且与任务方差呈线性关系；在高方差、分布外条件下（噪声达训练时10倍），两比特量子门校准实现>40%保真度提升；该规律在经典控制中亦成立，表明源于通用优化几何而非量子物理特有机制。

Conclusion: 所提出的缩放律为自适应控制提供了可迁移的决策框架，可用于权衡适应开销与收益，显著降低云量子处理器的逐设备校准时间。

Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合ARMA图卷积滤波器与Encoder-Only Transformer的联合虚假数据注入攻击（FDIA）检测与定位框架，以提升电网中对FDIA的检测精度与定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备在现代电力系统中的广泛应用扩大了网络攻击面，尤其是虚假数据注入攻击（FDIA）威胁测量完整性与系统可靠运行；现有基于图学习的检测方法难以兼顾局部结构依赖与全局上下文关系，且纯Transformer易忽略局部动态特性。

Method: 提出融合ARMA图卷积滤波器与Encoder-Only Transformer的联合检测与定位框架：ARMA滤波器实现拓扑感知、鲁棒的特征提取并适应频谱突变；Transformer编码器通过自注意力机制建模电网元件间的长程依赖，同时保留关键局部信息。

Result: 在NYISO真实负荷数据驱动的IEEE 14节点和300节点系统上验证，该方法能有效融合电网状态与拓扑信息，在FDIA检测与被攻击节点定位任务中均取得高精度。

Conclusion: 所提框架在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了FDIA检测与定位性能，为智能电网网络安全提供了兼具局部敏感性与全局建模能力的新范式。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled measurement devices in modern power systems has expanded the cyberattack surface of the grid. As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively exploits both the state and topology of the power grid, achieving high accuracy in detecting FDIA events and localizing compromised nodes.

*Haolin Liu,Dian Yu,Sidi Lu,Yujun Zhou,Rui Liu,Zhenwen Liang,Haitao Mi,Chen-Yu Wei,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO)方法，利用过程奖励模型（PRM）仅定位推理路径中的首个错误，将轨迹划分为已验证的正确前缀和错误后缀，并分别给予奖励与惩罚，从而改善信用分配并提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稀疏结果奖励的强化学习方法无法奖励部分成功的中间步骤；而过程奖励模型（PRM）虽提供细粒度监督，但其评分噪声大、难评估，且当前PRM评测目标（检测首个错误）与RL中将其分数直接用作奖励的做法存在错位。

Method: 提出VPPO方法：在RL训练中，仅用PRM定位推理路径中第一个错误位置，将轨迹划分为‘已验证正确前缀’和‘错误后缀’，对前缀给予正向奖励，仅在错误位置之后施加针对性惩罚，避免直接使用噪声PRM分值作为逐步奖励。

Result: VPPO在多个推理基准上一致优于稀疏奖励RL及先前PRM引导基线，在Pass@1和Pass@K指标上均有提升，同时带来更稳定、可解释的学习信号。

Conclusion: VPPO通过解耦PRM的诊断功能与奖励功能，有效弥合了PRM评测目标与RL实际应用之间的鸿沟，显著提升了LLM推理训练的信用分配效率与性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.

*Fangzhou Wu,Sandeep Silwal,Qiuyi,Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的数学模型，联合优化KV缓存驱逐与查询路由，在多LLM服务场景下兼顾负载均衡与缓存命中率，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存驱逐策略（如LRU）在动态在线查询和多LLM协同服务中表现不佳，负载均衡与高缓存命中率存在本质冲突。

Method: 构建联合建模KV缓存驱逐与查询路由的统一数学框架；提出兼具理论保证的随机化驱逐策略与基于学习的自适应查询路由方法。

Result: 在4个基准和3种前缀共享设置下，相比SOTA方法：缓存命中率最高提升6.92×，延迟降低11.96×，首token时延降低14.06×，吞吐量提升77.4%。

Conclusion: 联合优化驱逐与路由是提升多LLM服务系统性能的关键路径，所提方法兼具理论严谨性与实践有效性。

Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于带状矩阵近似的高效高斯过程（GP）训练方法，通过去除平方指数（SE）协方差矩阵中接近零的非对角元，降低逆矩阵与行列式计算复杂度，并在1D SE核下进行了理论分析和实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程训练因协方差矩阵求逆与行列式计算导致计算开销大，而SE协方差矩阵存在大量接近零的非对角元，可被安全截断以提升效率。

Method: 构造一种有原则的截断策略，将SE协方差矩阵近似为带状矩阵，利用其稀疏结构加速逆与行列式计算；并在1D SE核设定下进行理论分析以保证近似后协方差结构不失真。

Result: 所提带状近似方法显著降低了GP训练的计算成本，在实验中展现出优于变分自由能稀疏GP方法的计算效率。

Conclusion: 带状矩阵近似是一种理论上合理、计算上高效的GP训练加速策略，尤其适用于1D且使用SE核的场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero. We construct a principled procedure to eliminate those entries to produce a \emph{banded}-matrix approximation to the original covariance, whose inverse and determinant can be computed at a reduced computational cost, thus contributing to an efficient approximation to the likelihood function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.

TL;DR: EVEREST是一个基于Transformer的轻量级概率预测模型，专为多变量时间序列中的罕见事件预测设计，具备不确定性量化、尾部风险建模和可解释性，在空间天气数据上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多变量时间序列中罕见事件预测面临的严重类别不平衡、长程依赖和分布不确定性等挑战。

Method: 提出EVEREST架构，包含可学习注意力瓶颈、证据推理头（Normal-Inverse-Gamma分布）、极值头（广义帕累托分布）和前兆检测头，并采用复合损失函数联合优化；部署时仅用单一分类头，无推理开销。

Result: 在十年空间天气数据上，24/48/72小时预报的True Skill Statistic分别达0.973/0.970/0.966，参数量约0.81M，训练高效且适用于高风险领域。

Conclusion: EVEREST实现了高精度、校准良好、风险感知且可解释的罕见事件预测，具备实际部署价值，但受限于固定长度输入和缺乏图像模态支持。

Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了微缩放量化中块大小减小反而导致模型性能下降的反直觉现象，并从实验和理论两方面分析其成因，指出窄张量分布与量化尺度动态范围受限之间的相互作用是主因；进而提出采用FP8 UE5M3格式作为FP4微缩放中尺度的新硬件友好表示，无需全局缩放操作即可达到与传统E4M3相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微缩放数据格式虽能实现高效模型压缩，但其在训练与推理中的硬件友好实现仍面临挑战，尤其当块尺寸减小时出现性能异常下降，违背常规认知，亟需深入理解并解决该问题。

Method: 通过实验分析多个大语言模型权重分布，识别异常行为的触发条件；同时构建理论框架，解耦量化误差来源，并验证其与实际预训练模型分布的一致性；最后提出FP8 UE5M3作为尺度表示的新格式并评估其效果。

Result: 发现微缩放中性能异常下降源于窄张量分布与量化尺度有限动态范围的相互作用；UE5M3格式在不引入全局缩放操作的前提下，实现了与E4M3相当的模型精度。

Conclusion: 微缩放并非越细粒度越好，块大小存在下限；UE5M3是一种更优、更硬件友好的尺度表示方案，可简化硬件设计并保持性能。

Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.

*Philip Amortila,Audrey Huang,Akshay Krishnamurthy,Nan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对线性可实现设定下离策略评估（OPE）的新有限样本分析方法，聚焦于LSTDQ算法，并引入了新的覆盖度量——特征动力学覆盖，以统一理解不同假设下的覆盖参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性OPE理论在仅假设目标值函数线性可实现的最小设定下，对覆盖参数的理解不清晰、不统一，且已有定义存在缺陷并脱离标准定义。

Method: 基于工具变量视角，对经典LSTDQ算法进行新型有限样本分析，提出‘特征-动力学覆盖’这一新覆盖参数，刻画特征演化所诱导的动力系统中的线性覆盖程度。

Result: 建立了依赖于特征-动力学覆盖的新误差界；在附加假设（如Bellman完备性）下，该定义能自然退化为对应设定下的经典覆盖参数，实现了覆盖概念的统一。

Conclusion: 特征-动力学覆盖为线性OPE提供了更本质、更普适的覆盖刻画，推动了在最小建模假设下对统计速率的紧致刻画与理论统一。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了统计公平性度量中统计均等（Statistical-Parity）与机会均等（Equalized-Odds）之间的关系，指出二者在敏感群体基率不平衡时存在内在不兼容性，并强调实践中需预先评估基率差异及其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统计均等适用于无真实标签的场景，被广泛用于法律与行业框架；而机会均等依赖可靠真实标签，在某些情形下更必要。二者适用条件不同，但其关系尚不清晰，尤其在基率失衡时可能冲突，亟需理论厘清。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究统计均等与机会均等在不同敏感群体基率条件下的数学关系，揭示基率不平衡如何导致二者不可同时满足，并提出实践中的权衡建议。

Result: 证明了当敏感群体基率不同时，统计均等与机会均等在一般情况下无法共存；明确了二者兼容的充要条件；指出在基率失衡场景下强行要求统计均等可能导致违背公平目标。

Conclusion: 应优先评估数据中敏感群体的基率平衡性，并在设计公平性策略前判断统计均等与机会均等是否兼容；该发现对算法实践、政策制定及法律框架优化具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: A key challenge in employing data, algorithms and data-driven systems is to adhere to the principle of fairness and justice. Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在数据稀缺场景下表现不佳，且难以超越传统指纹方法，亟需引入化学先验知识以提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出跨图交互消息传递（XIMP），支持在任意数量的分子图抽象（如分子图、 scaffold-aware junction trees、 pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs）之间进行直接与间接的迭代消息传递。

Result: 在十个不同的分子性质预测任务上，XIMP在大多数情况下优于当前最优基线方法，尤其在低数据场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: XIMP通过融合多种可解释的化学图抽象作为归纳偏置，有效引导模型学习符合化学规律的表征，从而提升小样本下的预测准确率与可解释性。

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is central to drug discovery, yet graph neural networks often underperform in data-scarce regimes and fail to surpass traditional fingerprints. We introduce cross-graph inter-message passing (XIMP), which performs message passing both within and across multiple related graph representations. For small molecules, we combine the molecular graph with scaffold-aware junction trees and pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs, integrating complementary abstractions. While prior work is either limited to a single abstraction or non-iterative communication across graphs, XIMP supports an arbitrary number of abstractions and both direct and indirect communication between them in each layer. Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, leveraging interpretable abstractions as an inductive bias that guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization in low-data settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列数据增强方法多依赖启发式和静态范式，而动态数据优化表明样本贡献随训练阶段变化，因此需要一种能适配不同训练步骤的动态增强策略。

Method: 提出OATS框架：以高价值训练样本为引导信号，结合扩散模型生成逼真时间序列，并引入探索-利用机制平衡效率与效果。

Result: 在六个验证数据集和两种TSFM架构上，OATS持续优于常规训练及静态数据增强基线，带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: OATS是一种原理清晰、动态适应的在线数据增强方法，有效提升了TSFMs的训练质量与泛化能力。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are a powerful paradigm for time series analysis and are often enhanced by synthetic data augmentation to improve the training data quality. Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何利用用户编辑部署数据（包括上下文、模型响应和用户编辑）对大语言模型进行微调，提出了一种能统一处理偏好、监督标签和成本等多种反馈类型的集成学习方法，并在多个实验中验证了其优越性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户编辑数据天然来源于实际应用（如写作助手、编程助手），具有真实性和个性化潜力，但现有研究通常将偏好、监督标签、成本等反馈类型分开处理，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 首先为各类反馈（偏好、监督标签、成本）分别推导学习算法的理论界，分析其权衡；然后提出一种简单而有效的集成学习方法，联合利用多种反馈类型。

Result: 在两个基于Gao et al. 2024构建的领域上，所提集成方法优于单一反馈类型的学习方法；且在测试时面对不同用户编辑分布时表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 用户编辑是一种有价值且可统一建模的反馈信号；集成多种反馈类型的学习策略不仅理论上合理，在实践中也更有效和鲁棒。

Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文严格研究了深度神经网络（DNNs）和循环神经网络（RNNs）在sigmoid激活函数下的热力学极限，将其建模为连续神经网络，并利用p-adic整数刻画其层次结构；揭示了参数空间中从唯一稳态到无限多稳态的临界分岔现象，并将临界组织描述为奇异吸引子；还分析了随机DNNs/RNNs在无限宽度极限下的输出分布，发现其具有以高斯分布为常数项的幂级数展开形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度与循环神经网络在大规模（如无限宽度）下的宏观行为及其相变机制，特别是如何用数学上严格的框架（如热力学极限、p-adic分析）刻画其层次性与临界性。

Method: 采用热力学极限理论建模连续神经网络；引入p-adic整数编码层次结构，并构造p-adic树状拓扑；分析临界分岔与状态多重性；对随机网络设定参数为函数空间中的广义高斯随机变量，推导无限宽度下输出的概率分布。

Result: 证明了在特定参数区域内存在唯一连续稳态，该区域外发生分岔导致无限多稳态；建立了层次结构与临界组织的数学联系；将toy模型（p-adic细胞神经网络图像边缘检测器）的临界组织表征为奇异吸引子；推得随机DNN/RNN输出分布具有以高斯分布为首项的幂级数展开。

Conclusion: DNNs和RNNs在热力学极限下展现出类似物理系统的相变行为，p-adic分析为理解其内在层次与临界动力学提供了有力工具；随机网络在无限宽度极限下输出服从可展开的非高斯分布，但主导项仍为高斯分布。

Abstract: We rigorously study the thermodynamic limit of deep neural networks (DNNS) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), assuming that the activation functions are sigmoids. A thermodynamic limit is a continuous neural network, where the neurons form a continuous space with infinitely many points. We show that such a network admits a unique state in a certain region of the parameter space, which depends continuously on the parameters. This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states. We use p-adic integers to codify hierarchical structures. Indeed, we present an algorithm that recasts the hierarchical topologies used in DNNs and RNNs as p-adic tree-like structures. In this framework, the hierarchical and the critical organizations are connected. We study rigorously the critical organization of a toy model, a hierarchical edge detector for grayscale images based on p-adic cellular neural networks. The critical organization of such a network can be described as a strange attractor. In the second part, we study random versions of DNNs and RNNs. In this case, the network parameters are generalized Gaussian random variables in a space of quadratic integrable functions. We compute the probability distribution of the output given the input, in the infinite-width case. We show that it admits a power-type expansion, where the constant term is a Gaussian distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOOPER is a safe reinforcement learning method that uses conservative policy priors and probabilistic dynamics models to enable optimistic exploration while ensuring safety through pessimistic fallbacks, with theoretical guarantees on safety and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe exploration is essential for RL agents to learn and adapt online in real-world environments beyond controlled simulations.

Method: SOOPER utilizes suboptimal yet conservative policies as priors and employs probabilistic dynamics models to enable optimistic exploration while falling back pessimistically to the conservative prior when necessary.

Result: SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, converges to an optimal policy with bounded cumulative regret, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware.

Conclusion: SOOPER provides a scalable, theoretically grounded framework for safe online RL, validated both empirically and theoretically.

Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.

### [159] [Speed is Confidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19085)
*Joshua V. Dillon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种受生物神经启发的高效推理机制——'先到先得'（first-to-halt）策略，应用于Tiny Recursive Models（TRM）求解数独难题，在显著降低计算开销的同时达到与测试时增强（TTA）相当的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物神经系统快速响应且能量受限的启发，作者希望借鉴‘首个触发信号即代表最高置信度’的原理，设计更高效的模型推理与训练机制。

Method: 在推理阶段，仅采用ensemble中首个停止（halt）的模型输出作为最终预测；在训练阶段，维护K个并行隐状态，但仅对损失最低的‘胜者’进行反向传播（winner-take-all training）。同时引入改进版SwiGLU以支持资源受限下的高效训练（Muon架构）。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme任务上，单次前向推理达到96.9%±0.6%准确率（媲美TTA的97.3%），计算量仅为TTA的1/10；使用K=1训练可在40分钟内超越基线，K=4训练6小时达最优性能。

Conclusion: ‘时间即置信度’可被建模为推理与训练双重机制，无需测试时增强即可实现高精度与高效率统一，验证了生物启发式稀疏激活策略在小型递归模型中的有效性。

Abstract: Biological neural systems must be fast but are energy-constrained. Evolution's solution: act on the first signal. Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss "winner," a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min). Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4.

TL;DR: 本文提出Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex)，一种在高维动作空间中直接进行探索的强化学习方法，利用学习到的价值函数引导概率流进行任务相关探索，显著提升高维连续控制任务的性能和样本效率。


<details>

Motivation: 高维系统（如生物与机器人系统）的控制面临状态-动作空间庞大、传统探索策略效果随动作维度增加而急剧下降的挑战；现有降维方法限制策略表达能力并牺牲系统灵活性。

Method: Qflex通过可学习的源分布，在原生高维动作空间中沿由学习到的价值函数诱导的概率流进行动作采样，使探索方向对齐任务相关的梯度而非各向同性噪声。

Result: Qflex在多个高维连续控制基准测试中显著优于主流在线强化学习基线，并成功控制全身体人肌肉骨骼模型完成敏捷复杂的运动，展现出优异的可扩展性和样本效率。

Conclusion: 基于价值函数引导的概率流为大规模高维探索提供了原理清晰且实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional systems in biological and robotic applications is challenging due to expansive state-action spaces, where effective exploration is critical. Commonly used exploration strategies in reinforcement learning are largely undirected with sharp degradation as action dimensionality grows. Many existing methods resort to dimensionality reduction, which constrains policy expressiveness and forfeits system flexibility. We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise. Our proposed method substantially outperforms representative online reinforcement learning baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks. Qflex also successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model to perform agile, complex movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency in very high-dimensional settings. Our results indicate that value-guided flows offer a principled and practical route to exploration at scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为EPAS的高效训练方法，通过在Transformer深层逐步共享QK/KV激活来提升训练和推理吞吐量，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer深层存在冗余QK/KV激活的问题，结合渐进式训练范式以提升训练与推理效率。

Method: EPAS在训练过程中逐步扩展激活共享区域，从模型深层开始向浅层生长；支持在推理时根据计算预算灵活调整共享区域长度。

Result: 在125M至7B参数的LLaMA模型上，训练吞吐量最高提升11.1%，推理吞吐量最高提升29%；在TinyLLaMA持续预训练中，平均准确率较SOTA提升10%。

Conclusion: EPAS验证了渐进式训练对跨层激活共享模型的有效性，兼顾效率与性能。

Abstract: We present a novel method for Efficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS). This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.

Conclusion: ULEE是一种有效的无监督元学习范式，能提升智能体在未知多样化任务中的快速适应能力，验证了以能力前沿为导向的对抗性课程设计的有效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需原始数据的隐私保护模型转录方法——差分隐私合成蒸馏，通过生成器、教师模型和学生模型三者协同竞争学习，在不访问私有数据的情况下将预训练模型转换为隐私保护版本，并理论证明其满足差分隐私与收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在私有数据上训练后部署可能引发隐私泄露风险（如数据或标签知识被恢复），亟需一种无需访问原始私有数据的隐私保护模型转换方案。

Method: 提出差分隐私合成蒸馏（DP Synthetic Distillation），构建生成器、教师模型、学生模型三方协同竞争框架：生成器合成数据；教师与学生基于合成数据计算差分隐私标签（通过数据或标签加噪）；学生用噪声标签更新，生成器则以学生为判别器进行对抗训练；交替优化三者。

Result: 所转录的学生模型兼具高精度与强隐私保护能力；生成器可产出可用于下游任务的隐私合成数据；实验表明该方法显著优于26种SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 该数据无关的模型转录方法在保证差分隐私理论保障的同时，实现了高性能与实用性统一，为隐私敏感场景下的模型部署提供了新范式。

Abstract: While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.

Motivation: 现有神经物理求解器泛化能力差，难以应对参数、几何结构和初始条件的分布偏移，限制了新设计探索与长时预测。

Method: NOVA通过从稀疏初始场景中学习物理对齐表征，实现对偏微分方程参数、几何与初始条件变化的强泛化能力。

Result: 在热传导、扩散-反应与流体流动等非线性问题上，NOVA比数据驱动基线模型在分布外误差上低1–2个数量级；并成功应用于非线性Turing系统模拟与流体芯片优化。

Conclusion: NOVA突破了传统神经物理求解器局限于检索或先验空间仿真的限制，实现了可靠外推，为科学发现中的新假设空间探索提供了关键能力。

Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery

TL;DR: 本文提出FloydNet，一种基于动态规划思想的新型图神经网络架构，通过维护全局全对关系张量并学习广义DP算子进行迭代优化，突破了传统GNN消息传递的局部性瓶颈，在算法推理、TSP求解和图表达能力测试中均达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络（GNN）受限于消息传递机制的局部性，难以支持复杂、多步、全局性的图推理；而动态规划（DP）通过迭代更新全局状态，更适合作为高阶图推理的学习范式。

Method: 提出FloydNet架构：摒弃局部消息传递，转而维护一个全局的全对关系张量，并设计可学习的广义动态规划算子，迭代精化该张量，从而构建任务特定的关系演算；理论分析其表达能力达3-WL（2-FWL）级别，并可推广至k-FWL层次。

Result: 在CLRS-30算法基准上准确率近100%；在通用TSP问题上找到精确最优解的比例显著超越强启发式方法；在BREC基准上经验性匹配3-WL测试能力。

Conclusion: FloydNet验证了基于动态规划的全局状态精化是一种比传统消息传递更强大且实用的高阶图推理范式，为复杂推理建模提供了新路径。

Abstract: Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.

Conclusion: OWLEYE为可扩展、标签高效的图异常检测奠定了坚实基础，推动了图基础模型在零样本与持续学习方向的发展。

Abstract: Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习教育割裂了算法与系统（如不结合内存/计算开销讲梯度下降或注意力机制），导致毕业生难以调试生产问题，加剧研究与可靠部署之间的鸿沟。

Method: 设计并实施TinyTorch课程：用纯Python实现PyTorch核心组件（张量、自动微分、优化器、神经网络）；遵循三大教学原则——渐进式披露、系统优先（从始即关注内存与性能）、历史里程碑验证（复现从1958年感知机到现代Transformer的关键突破）。

Result: 构建了一个仅需4GB RAM笔记本即可运行、无需GPU、开源可及的轻量级教学系统，已发布于mlsysbook.ai/tinytorch。

Conclusion: TinyTorch通过动手实现底层系统，培养既懂‘做什么’更懂‘为何有效’和‘如何扩展’的新一代AI工程师，推动机器学习教育向系统化、可实践、普适化转型。

Abstract: Machine learning systems engineering requires a deep understanding of framework internals. Yet most current education separates algorithms from systems. Students learn gradient descent without measuring memory usage, and attention mechanisms without profiling computational cost. This split leaves graduates unprepared to debug real production failures and widens the gap between machine learning research and reliable deployment. We present TinyTorch, a 20 module curriculum in which students implement the core components of PyTorch, including tensors, autograd, optimizers, and neural networks, entirely in pure Python. The curriculum is built around three pedagogical principles. Progressive disclosure gradually introduces complexity as students build confidence. Systems first integration embeds memory and performance awareness from the very beginning. Historical milestone validation guides students to recreate key breakthroughs, from the Perceptron in 1958 to modern Transformers, using only code they have written themselves. TinyTorch requires only a laptop with 4GB of RAM and no GPU, making machine learning systems education accessible worldwide. Its goal is to prepare the next generation of AI engineers, practitioners who understand not only what machine learning systems do, but why they work and how to make them scale. The curriculum is available as open source at mlsysbook.ai slash tinytorch.

Result: 在Apple M4 Max上，文本模型吞吐达525 tokens/s；多模态场景下重复图像查询延迟从21.7秒降至1秒内（28倍加速）；64帧视频分析获24.7倍缓存加速；文本模型吞吐比llama.cpp高21%–87%，16并发请求下聚合吞吐提升4.3倍。

Conclusion: vllm-mlx填补了Apple Silicon上高效多模态推理的空白，通过硬件感知设计与创新缓存机制，显著提升性能并开源以推动消费级苹果设备上的AI部署。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.

Yet discovering GPCR modulators remains challenging because receptor activation often arises from complex allosteric effects rather than direct binding affinity, and conventional assays are slow, costly, and not optimized for capturing these dynamics. Here we present GPCR-Filter, a deep learning framework specifically developed for GPCR modulator discovery. We assembled a high-quality dataset of over 90,000 experimentally validated GPCR-ligand pairs, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluation. GPCR-Filter integrates the ESM-3 protein language model for high-fidelity GPCR sequence representations with graph neural networks that encode ligand structures, coupled through an attention-based fusion mechanism that learns receptor-ligand functional relationships. Across multiple evaluation settings, GPCR-Filter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compound-protein interaction models and exhibits strong generalization to unseen receptors and ligands. Notably, the model successfully identified micromolar-level agonists of the 5-HT\textsubscript{1A} receptor with distinct chemical frameworks. These results establish GPCR-Filter as a scalable and effective computational approach for GPCR modulator discovery, advancing AI-assisted drug development for complex signaling systems.

*Qipeng Zhan,Zhuoping Zhou,Zexuan Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合非均匀方差正则化和等距约束的新自动编码器框架，作为PCA在非线性场景下的自然推广，以保持有序表征和方差保留等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性自动编码器虽能通过特定正则化或损失函数复现PCA主成分，但在非线性情况下无法独立捕获剩余方差，导致其推广受限。

Method: 提出一种新型自动编码器框架，融合非均匀方差正则化与等距约束，使模型在非线性降维中仍能保持PCA的关键性质。

Result: 该框架成功实现了对PCA的自然非线性推广，在保持有序表示和方差保留能力的同时，提升了非线性降维效果。

Conclusion: 所提方法为非线性维度约简提供了更符合PCA原理的建模方式，弥合了线性PCA与非线性自动编码器之间的理论鸿沟。

Abstract: Autoencoders have long been considered a nonlinear extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks.

*Benjamin Turtel,Paul Wilczewski,Danny Franklin,Kris Skotheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种全自动数据生成管道，将SEC文件中的定性风险披露转化为时间锚定的监督信号，用于训练轻量级大语言模型来预测风险事件在未来特定时间窗口内发生的概率，显著优于现有基线模型，并实现了无需人工标注、仅依赖公开文本的领域专家模型构建范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEC文件中的风险披露通常缺乏对风险发生概率的量化，限制了其在概率分析中的应用；核心障碍在于缺乏大规模、风险级别的监督数据，将披露的风险与实际结果关联起来。

Method: 构建全自动数据生成流水线：从SEC文件‘风险因素’部分提取公司特异性、时间限定的风险查询，并通过后续披露自动解析并标注其是否实现；基于该风险查询-结果数据集，训练一个紧凑型大语言模型进行概率估计。

Result: 所训练的小型模型在概率准确性与校准性上显著超越预训练模型和启发式基线，甚至优于GPT-5等前沿通用大模型；验证了仅用原始、时序化、领域内文本即可实现高性能、可部署（单GPU）的领域专家模型训练。

Conclusion: Foresight Learning范式可规模化、全自动地从企业文档中学习校准的、决策相关信号，为金融风险建模提供了新路径，且所有评估数据已开源。

Abstract: Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.
  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.
  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.
  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.
  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种加速的多目标Wasserstein梯度下降算法（A-MWGraD），在Wasserstein空间中优化多个目标，理论证明其收敛速率优于原有MWGraD，并通过核方法离散化与实验验证其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MWGraD算法在Wasserstein空间中多目标优化的收敛速度较慢（O(1/t)），需提升效率；同时需利用该空间的几何结构实现更快、更稳定的Pareto最优解收敛。

Method: 基于Nesterov加速思想，构建A-MWGraD连续时间动力学模型；理论分析其在Wasserstein概率空间中的收敛性；引入核函数进行实用离散化实现；通过多目标采样任务开展数值实验。

Result: A-MWGraD在测地凸目标下达到O(1/t²)收敛率，在β-强测地凸下达O(e^{-√βt})，优于MWGraD的O(1/t)；实验表明其在收敛速度和采样效率上均显著优于MWGraD。

Conclusion: A-MWGraD是一种理论上更优、实践中更高效的多目标Wasserstein优化算法，为概率分布空间中的多目标学习提供了新工具。

Abstract: We study multi-objective optimization over probability distributions in Wasserstein space. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2025) introduced Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD) algorithm, which exploits the geometric structure of Wasserstein space to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\sqrtβt}) for $β$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合强化学习与潜在扩散模型（SOLD）的新框架，用于RNA逆折叠任务，显著提升了对二级结构一致性、最小自由能和LDDT等非可微结构目标的优化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RNA逆折叠方法难以有效优化非可微的结构目标（如SS、MFE、LDDT），导致结构精度不足。

Method: 提出SOLD框架：将强化学习与基于RNA-FM嵌入的潜在扩散模型结合，通过策略驱动的奖励优化，在单步噪声层面进行高效结构优化，避免完整扩散采样。

Result: 实验表明SOLD在所有评估指标上均超越其LDM基线及当前最优方法。

Conclusion: SOLD为RNA逆折叠提供了鲁棒新范式，对生物技术与治疗应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

Conclusion: CSPDNN有效平衡了数据驱动与物理约束，在减少数据依赖的同时显著提升了逆散射问题的求解效率与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been applied to inverse scattering problems (ISPs) due to their strong nonlinear mapping capabilities. However, supervised DNN solvers require large-scale datasets, which limits their generalization in practical applications. Untrained neural networks (UNNs) address this issue by updating weights from measured electric fields and prior physical knowledge, but existing UNN solvers suffer from long inference time. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a contrast-source-based physics-driven neural network (CSPDNN), which predicts the induced current distribution to improve efficiency and incorporates an adaptive total variation loss for robust reconstruction under varying contrast and noise conditions. The improved imaging performance is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental data.

Conclusion: 该框架有效弥合了大规模自动化与专家决策之间的鸿沟，展示了LLM在运营业务中赋能可解释、可靠异常检测的潜力。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出E-QRGMM框架，通过结合三次埃尔米特插值与梯度估计，加速了基于分位数回归的生成元建模（QRGMM），在保持理论收敛率的同时显著提升计算效率，并在分布精度与训练速度间取得更好权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协变量依赖的不确定性量化在基于仿真的推断中至关重要，但现有方法（如共形预测和经典自助法）难以实现协变量特定条件下的准确量化。

Method: 提出高效分位数回归生成元建模（E-QRGMM），融合三次埃尔米特插值与梯度估计，降低网格复杂度；理论上证明其保持原QRGMM收敛率；实证上对比QRGMM及其他深度生成模型。

Conclusion: E-QRGMM为协变量依赖不确定性量化提供了兼具理论保证与实用性的新方案，在高风险决策场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods such as conformal prediction and classical bootstrap, which struggle with covariate-specific conditioning. We propose Efficient Quantile-Regression-Based Generative Metamodeling (E-QRGMM), a novel framework that accelerates the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) approach by integrating cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation. Theoretically, we show that E-QRGMM preserves the convergence rate of the original QRGMM while reducing grid complexity from $O(n^{1/2})$ to $O(n^{1/5})$ for the majority of quantile levels, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Empirically, E-QRGMM achieves a superior trade-off between distributional accuracy and training speed compared to both QRGMM and other advanced deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Moreover, by enabling bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands of interest, E-QRGMM provides a practical solution for covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO)框架，通过动态难度分组与自适应采样/rollout分配，在推理后训练中提升LLM对难样本的学习效率，显著超越GRPO基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法（如GRPO）在推理后训练中采用静态均匀的prompt采样和固定rollout数，难以适配异构、重尾的推理数据分布，导致计算资源浪费于简单样本而忽视困难样本。

Method: 提出GDRO框架，包含：(1) Online Difficulty Classifier动态划分prompt难度组；(2) Prompt-GDRO：基于EMA去偏的乘性权重bandit采样器，聚焦高难度边缘并避免频率偏差；(3) Rollout-GDRO：基于影子价格控制器的rollout再分配机制，在总计算量不变下最大化困难任务梯度方差降低，并给出平方根最优分配理论依据。

Conclusion: 优化训练分布本身（而非仅损失函数或对齐策略）是提升LLM推理能力的关键路径；GDRO通过双层对抗式分布鲁棒优化，实现了计算高效、理论可证、性能显著的推理后训练新范式。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.
  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需端到端反向传播的分割学习训练方法，通过在分割点引入辅助分类器和局部损失信号，实现客户端与服务器半独立训练，从而将通信开销降低约50%，峰值内存使用减少最多达58%，同时保持与标准分割学习相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割学习依赖端到端反向传播，导致通信开销大（每轮需交换前向激活和反向梯度）和内存占用高（需存储激活和梯度）。

Method: 客户端网络在分割点增加小型辅助分类器以提供本地误差信号；服务器则基于客户端传输的激活，用真实损失函数进行训练；双方不再传递反向梯度，实现训练解耦。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上验证：1）模型性能与标准分割学习相当；2）通信量减少约50%，峰值内存使用降低最多58%。

Conclusion: 所提超越反向传播的分割学习方法，在不牺牲精度的前提下，显著降低了通信与内存开销，提升了分布式学习的效率与可行性。

Abstract: Split learning is a distributed training paradigm where a neural network is partitioned between clients and a server, which allows data to remain at the client while only intermediate activations are shared. Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%.

Motivation: 扩散模型虽生成质量高，但存在记忆化问题（即生成样本与训练样本完全一致），需从理论上解释其成因并提出有效缓解方法。

Method: 构建基于经验分数函数的理论框架，指出其为带尖锐softmax权重的高斯分数函数加权和；据此提出Noise Unconditioning（自适应调整样本权重）和Temperature Smoothing（提高softmax温度以平滑权重）两种方法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了理论分析的正确性，并表明所提方法能有效缓解记忆化、提升泛化能力，同时保持高质量生成。

Conclusion: 记忆化源于经验分数函数中单一样本的主导效应；神经网络通过学习更平滑的近似缓解该问题；所提两种方法进一步增强平滑性与局部流形建模能力，从而改善泛化。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generation quality, yet face a fundamental challenge known as memorization, where generated samples can replicate training samples exactly. We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality.

Conclusion: 将采购过程的动态事件信息纳入建模可显著提升PLT预测精度，验证了过程感知建模在工程定制行业供应链管理中的关键价值。

Abstract: Accurately predicting procurement lead time (PLT) remains a challenge in engineered-to-order industries such as shipbuilding and plant construction, where delays in a single key component can disrupt project timelines. In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation. Three tasks are evaluated, which are production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction. The results show a 22.6% to 50.4% improvement in prediction performance in terms of mean absolute error over the best-performing existing approaches across the three tasks. These findings indicate the value of considering procurement process information for more accurate PLT prediction.

Motivation: 受近期研究表明跨注意力头交互可提升注意力性能的启发，作者希望设计一种能显式建模头间交互的注意力机制。

Result: MEA在预训练中表现出强鲁棒性，支持更大学习率、更快收敛、更低验证损失及多项任务性能提升；KV缓存压缩50%时，在知识密集型与科学推理任务中性能几乎无损，奥赛级数学基准仅下降3.59%准确率。

Conclusion: MEA是一种简单有效、鲁棒性强且参数高效的注意力变体，兼顾性能提升与部署实用性，尤其适用于内存受限场景。

Abstract: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce contextual queueing bandits, a new context-aware framework for scheduling while simultaneously learning unknown service rates. Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$. Lastly, we provide experimental results that validate our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出NeuNeu方法，利用神经网络直接从数据中预测下游任务的缩放规律，克服了传统基于验证困惑度预测的局限性，在66个下游任务上实现2.04%的平均绝对误差，较逻辑缩放律降低38%，并具备零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于验证困惑度预测下游性能的方法存在两个缺陷：一是对token级损失取平均会掩盖关键信号，二是缺乏能覆盖全部缩放行为的简单参数化函数族。

Method: 提出NeuNeu——一种将缩放律预测建模为时间序列外推的神经网络，融合观测到的准确率轨迹（时序上下文）和token级验证损失，不依赖预设瓶颈或函数形式；完全基于HuggingFace开源模型检查点训练。

Result: 在66个下游任务上预测模型准确率的平均绝对误差为2.04%，比逻辑缩放律（3.29% MAE）降低38%；且能零样本泛化至未见模型族、参数量和下游任务。

Conclusion: 直接从数据学习下游缩放规律优于参数化建模方法，NeuNeu为更准确、更通用的性能预测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws predict how language model performance improves with increased compute. While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks. Our work suggests that predicting downstream scaling laws directly from data outperforms parametric alternatives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了LightSBB-M算法，基于Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB)框架，通过双重表示和可调参数β，在少数迭代中高效求解最优SBB传输方案，并在合成数据和图像翻译任务中显著优于现有SB与扩散模型基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Schrodinger Bridge（SB）方法难以兼顾漂移与波动控制，而SBB虽能联合控制二者，但缺乏高效求解算法；需一种兼具理论严谨性与计算可扩展性的新方法。

Method: 提出LightSBB-M算法，利用SBB目标函数的对偶表示推导出最优漂移与波动的解析表达式，并引入可调参数β实现从纯漂移（SB）到纯波动（Bass）的连续插值。

Result: 在合成数据上以最高达32%的幅度降低2-Wasserstein距离，优于当前SB与扩散模型基线；在FFHQ数据集的成人→儿童人脸无配对图像翻译任务中验证了其生成能力。

Conclusion: LightSBB-M是一种可扩展、高保真的SBB求解器，在合成与真实世界生成任务中均显著超越现有SB及扩散模型方法。

Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM缩放正面临瓶颈：宽度和上下文长度扩展收益递减；深度扩展虽理论优势明显，但现有Transformer架构难以在极深深度下稳定训练，尤其是Post-LN因残差路径导致梯度消失而被Pre-LN取代。

Method: 重新审视Post-LayerNorm结构，识别其失效主因是ResNet式残差路径引发的梯度消失；提出Keel模型，将残差连接替换为Highway-style连接以保障梯度流畅通；无需特殊初始化或复杂优化技巧。

Result: Keel可在超过1000层深度下稳健训练，持续降低语言建模困惑度，并显著改善深度扩展特性，性能一致优于Pre-LN基线。

Conclusion: Post-LayerNorm结合Highway-style连接是一种简单而有效的深度可扩展LLM基础架构，为构建无限深度模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.

Motivation: 现有IoT流量分类方法多依赖端到端监督训练或任务特定微调，导致表征与标注数据和部署环境强耦合，泛化能力受限。

Method: 设计轻量级无监督编解码器架构，从无标签IoT网络流中学习每流嵌入；采用冻结编码器+简单监督分类器的协议进行评估，并通过重建分析验证表征质量。

Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying network traffic and identifying Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, enabling operators to discover and manage IoT assets at scale. However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了StableQAT，一种基于离散傅里叶分析构建的新型量化感知训练框架，通过更优的梯度代理提升超低位宽（2–4 bit）下的训练稳定性与性能，且开销极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练（QAT）方法在超低位宽下存在梯度不匹配、训练不稳定或计算开销大等问题，亟需更鲁棒、高效的优化方案。

Method: 提出StableQAT框架，利用离散傅里叶分析对舍入算子建模，构造轻量、理论可证的梯度代理函数；该代理严格泛化直通估计器（STE），提供平滑、有界、低代价的梯度。

Result: 在2–4 bit量化设置下，StableQAT显著提升训练稳定性、超参数鲁棒性与最终精度，且训练开销可忽略；实验验证其优于主流QAT方法。

Conclusion: StableQAT为超低位宽QAT提供了统一、高效、理论扎实的新范式，兼具实用性与泛化性。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints, yet achieving stable and robust optimization at ultra-low bitwidths remains challenging. Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

*Rahul Raychaudhury,Aryan Esmailpour,Sainyam Galhotra,Stavros Sintos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究在仅能访问噪声四元组比较查询（而非精确距离）的情况下，如何高效进行k-聚类（如k-均值/中位数），提出具有低查询复杂度和理论保证的随机算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典k-聚类算法依赖精确成对距离，但在许多实际场景（如基于大模型或人工反馈的相似性判断）中，只能获得相对距离比较（四元组查询），且该查询有噪声、有成本。因此需要在Rank-model下设计鲁棒、高效的聚类算法。

Method: 设计基于噪声四元组 oracle 的随机化算法，利用采样、分层聚类和距离估计技术，在任意度量空间及有界加倍维数度量空间中分别实现不同查询复杂度和近似比；特别地，在加倍维数有界时，结合细化策略实现 (1+ε)-近似。

Result: 在任意度量空间中，以 O(n·k·polylog n) 查询复杂度得到常数近似解；在有界加倍维数度量下，查询复杂度降至 O((n+k²)·polylog n)，并可达到 (1+ε)-近似；同时输出 O(k·polylog n) 个中心及对应分配。

Conclusion: 证明了即使仅依赖噪声、低成本的相对比较查询，仍可在理论保证下高效完成k-聚类；为将大语言模型等黑盒oracle系统化融入无监督学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.
  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.

Conclusion: 事件感知建模可有效增强世界模型的泛化性与鲁棒性，无需人工标注，且具有架构通用性，为MBRL提供了新范式。

Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重构误差的不确定性估计方法易受信息损失和表层细节干扰，效果受限，亟需更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出DRUE方法：利用辅助模型从两个中间层分别重建输入，并以二者重建输出之间的差异作为不确定性得分。

Result: 在青光眼检测（ID任务）及多个分布偏移程度不同的OOD数据集上，DRUE持续取得更高的AUC和AUPR指标。

Conclusion: DRUE为高风险场景下提升深度学习模型可靠性提供了一个原理清晰且有效可行的不确定性估计框架。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.

Result: GraphSB显著优于现有最先进方法；其结构平衡模块可作为即插即用组件，平均提升其他方法准确率4.57%。

Conclusion: 图结构不平衡是根本原因，结构平衡策略能有效缓解该问题，提升不平衡节点分类性能。

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导技术存在系数调优困难、层间范数变化敏感、二元控制能力有限以及Angular Steering违反范数保持导致生成崩溃等问题，尤其在7B以下模型中表现更差。

Method: 提出Selective Steering：(1) 数学上严格的范数保持旋转公式以维持激活分布完整性；(2) 判别性层选择机制，仅在特征表示呈现反向类别对齐的层上应用引导。

Result: 在九个模型上的实验表明，Selective Steering的攻击成功率是先前方法的5.5倍，零困惑度违规，并在标准基准上保持约100%能力保留。

Conclusion: Selective Steering为可控且稳定的LLM行为调控提供了原理清晰、高效实用的新框架。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

Motivation: 现有域泛化方法主要关注学习域不变特征，却忽视了模型参数层面对域偏移的敏感性差异，导致难以显式区分敏感与鲁棒参数，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 构建基于协方差的参数敏感性分析框架，计算多源域上参数梯度的协方差以识别敏感参数；在此基础上提出Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization（DSP-Reg），采用软正则化引导模型优化，增强对域不变参数的依赖、抑制域特异性参数。

Conclusion: 从参数敏感性角度建模域泛化问题具有有效性，DSP-Reg为提升模型跨域鲁棒性提供了新思路和实用框架。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在解决真实世界车辆路径问题（RWVRPs）时，因忽略序列依赖性和未充分利用边级信息而表现不佳，而这些恰是RWVRPs复杂性的核心。

Method: 提出SEAFormer：1）Clustered Proximity Attention（CPA）利用局部感知聚类将注意力复杂度从O(n²)降至O(n)，保持全局视角；2）轻量级边感知模块通过残差融合建模边级成对特征。

Result: 在四个不同规模的真实世界VRP变体上显著优于现有SOTA方法；首次成功求解1000+节点RWVRP；同时在经典VRP基准上也取得更优性能。

Conclusion: SEAFormer是一种兼顾效率与表达能力的通用架构，既适用于研究基准，也具备落地真实场景的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (RWVRPs) require solving complex, sequence-dependent challenges at scale with constraints such as delivery time window, replenishment or recharging stops, asymmetric travel cost, etc. While recent neural methods achieve strong results on large-scale classical VRP benchmarks, they struggle to address RWVRPs because their strategies overlook sequence dependencies and underutilize edge-level information, which are precisely the characteristics that define the complexity of RWVRPs. We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications.

Motivation: 模拟IC设计自动化面临物理布局、寄生效应与电路性能间复杂耦合的挑战，且缺乏高质量、开放的模拟领域专用数据集，限制了ML方法的基准测试与泛化能力。

Method: 提出OSIRIS数据集生成流水线，系统探索模拟电路设计空间，生成全面性能指标和元数据；并构建基于强化学习的基线优化方法，利用该数据集进行模拟设计优化。

Conclusion: OSIRIS为模拟IC自动化设计提供了可扩展的数据基础设施和初步算法范例，有望促进端到端、寄生感知的ML驱动设计框架发展。

Abstract: The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization.

*Binyan Xu,Fan Yang,Xilin Dai,Di Tang,Kehuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出PRISM框架，利用通用视觉语言模型（VLM）作为外部语义审计器，通过混合VLM教师和自适应路由器实现对后门攻击的鲁棒防御，显著降低攻击成功率并提升干净样本准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试时防御方法依赖内部诊断（如模型修复或输入鲁棒性），易受高级攻击影响，因其仍与被污染模型参数耦合；需将安全性从受害模型中解耦，转向外部、语义驱动的独立审计。

Method: 提出外部语义审计新范式，构建PRISM框架：1）混合VLM教师在线动态优化视觉原型以弥合领域差距；2）基于统计间隔监控的自适应路由器实时校准门控阈值；整体以通用VLM为独立语义守门人。

Result: 在17个数据集和11种攻击类型上广泛评估，PRISM将CIFAR-10上的攻击成功率压制至<1%，同时提升干净准确率，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: PRISM确立了模型无关、外部化安全的新标准，验证了外部语义审计范式在后门防御中的有效性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks remain inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Traditional test-time defenses largely operate under the paradigm of internal diagnosis methods like model repairing or input robustness, yet these approaches are often fragile under advanced attacks as they remain entangled with the victim model's corrupted parameters. We propose a paradigm shift from Internal Diagnosis to External Semantic Auditing, arguing that effective defense requires decoupling safety from the victim model via an independent, semantically grounded auditor. To this end, we present a framework harnessing Universal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as evolving semantic gatekeepers. We introduce PRISM (Prototype Refinement & Inspection via Statistical Monitoring), which overcomes the domain gap of general VLMs through two key mechanisms: a Hybrid VLM Teacher that dynamically refines visual prototypes online, and an Adaptive Router powered by statistical margin monitoring to calibrate gating thresholds in real-time. Extensive evaluation across 17 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrates that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance, suppressing Attack Success Rate to <1% on CIFAR-10 while improving clean accuracy, establishing a new standard for model-agnostic, externalized security.

### [197] [Fixed Aggregation Features Can Rival GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19449)
*Celia Rubio-Madrigal,Rebekka Burkholz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的图特征提取方法FAFs，通过固定聚合（如均值）将图学习任务转化为表格问题，使用简单MLP即可在多数基准上媲美甚至超越先进GNN和图Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战GNN必须依赖可学习邻域聚合才能有效表征节点的主流观点，探索非训练式聚合是否足够强大。

Method: 提出Fixed Aggregation Features（FAFs），采用固定（如均值）而非可学习的邻域聚合方式生成节点特征，将图数据转化为表格格式后接入标准tabular模型（如MLP）。

Result: 在14个基准中，基于FAFs+MLP的方法在12个任务上达到或超过SOTA GNN/图Transformer性能；仅在Roman Empire和Minesweeper两个需极深GNN的任务上略逊。理论分析关联Kolmogorov-Arnold表示，解释均值聚合为何常已足够。

Conclusion: 呼吁：(i) 构建更能体现多样化邻域聚合价值的基准；(ii) 将强tabular基线设为标准；(iii) 推动tabular模型在图学习中的应用与演进，以获得新洞见。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely believed to excel at node representation learning through trainable neighborhood aggregations. We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.

*Finn Rietz,Pedro Zuidberg dos Martires,Johannes Andreas Stork*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为自适应策略组合（APC）的分层模型，通过动态评估和组合多个基于归一化流（NF）的数据驱动先验，在强化学习中更鲁棒地利用稀疏、次优或任务不一致的演示数据，从而加速学习并避免性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于演示的强化学习方法通常假设演示是最优且与目标任务完全对齐的，但现实中演示往往是稀疏、次优或不一致的，直接使用易导致性能下降。

Method: 提出自适应策略组合（APC）框架，采用多个数据驱动的归一化流（NF）作为先验，动态估计各先验对目标任务的适用性，并选择性地精炼有用先验或绕过不一致先验，以支持探索与策略优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，APC在演示对齐时显著加速学习，在严重不一致时保持鲁棒性，并能有效利用次优演示引导探索，同时避免因过度依赖次优演示而导致的性能退化。

Conclusion: APC提供了一种更灵活、鲁棒的演示利用机制，提升了强化学习在现实非理想演示条件下的实用性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用DeepHit神经网络基于纵向运动员监测数据预测足球运动员受伤时间的可行性，并提供可解释的预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法多依赖静态赛季前数据和二元结果，实用性受限，亟需更动态、精准且可解释的损伤预测模型。

Method: 采用DeepHit深度生存模型（多层感知机结构），结合SoccerMon公开数据集（精英女足两赛季训练、比赛与健康数据），通过数据清洗、特征工程及三种插补策略预处理；对比随机森林、XGBoost、逻辑回归等基线模型，并采用时序验证与留一球员验证评估。

Result: DeepHit模型C指数达0.762，优于所有基线模型，可输出个体化、随时间变化的风险估计；SHAP分析识别出符合临床认知的关键风险因子，提升模型可解释性。

Conclusion: DeepHit在足球损伤预测中展现出高准确性、可解释性与实用性，为各级别竞技足球的损伤预防提供了新范式。

Abstract: Injury occurrence in football poses significant challenges for athletes and teams, carrying personal, competitive, and financial consequences. While machine learning has been applied to injury prediction before, existing approaches often rely on static pre-season data and binary outcomes, limiting their real-world utility. This study investigates the feasibility of using a DeepHit neural network to forecast time-to-injury from longitudinal athlete monitoring data, while providing interpretable predictions. The analysis utilised the publicly available SoccerMon dataset, containing two seasons of training, match, and wellness records from elite female footballers. Data was pre-processed through cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of three imputation strategies. Baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) were optimised via grid search for benchmarking, while the DeepHit model, implemented with a multilayer perceptron backbone, was evaluated using chronological and leave-one-player-out (LOPO) validation. DeepHit achieved a concordance index of 0.762, outperforming baseline models and delivering individualised, time-varying risk estimates. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified clinically relevant predictors consistent with established risk factors, enhancing interpretability. Overall, this study provides a novel proof of concept: survival modelling with DeepHit shows strong potential to advance injury forecasting in football, offering accurate, explainable, and actionable insights for injury prevention across competitive levels.

*Haonan Zhang,Dongxia Wang,Yi Liu,Kexin Chen,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM-VA方法，通过闭式权重更新对齐回答向量与安全判断向量，缓解大模型的越狱与过度拒绝问题，无需微调或结构修改，兼顾安全性与实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量引导方法在降低越狱和减少过度拒绝之间存在根本权衡；根本原因是模型将‘是否回答’与‘是否安全’建模为近似正交、相互独立的方向。

Method: LLM-VA利用SVM识别各层中的回答向量（v_a）和良性向量（v_b），筛选安全相关层，并通过最小范数权重修改迭代对齐二者方向，使回答意愿因果依赖于安全判断。

Result: 在12个LLM上实验表明，LLM-VA的F1比最优基线高11.45%，保持95.92%原始效用，并能自动适配各模型的安全偏差，无需人工调参。

Conclusion: 对齐回答与安全判断向量可打破传统权衡，LLM-VA提供了一种高效、通用、免训练的后处理对齐方案，提升安全对齐的鲁棒性与泛化性。

Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出GenCP，一种新颖的生成式范式，用于耦合多物理场仿真，通过将耦合物理建模视为概率建模问题，实现从解耦数据训练到耦合物理推断的突破，并提供误差可控性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实物理系统常涉及多物理场强耦合，现有方法在处理解耦数据时效果差、效率低、保真度不足。

Method: 将耦合物理建模转化为概率密度演化问题，结合生成建模与迭代多物理场耦合；利用算子分裂理论在概率演化空间中建立误差可控的“条件到联合”采样机制。

Result: 在合成数据及三个挑战性多物理场景中验证了GenCP的有效性，展现出原理性洞见与优越性能。

Conclusion: GenCP为多物理场仿真提供了新范式，兼具理论严谨性与实用高效性，支持基于解耦数据训练并实现高保真耦合推断。

Abstract: Real-world physical systems are inherently complex, often involving the coupling of multiple physics, making their simulation both highly valuable and challenging. Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this "conditional-to-joint" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型缺乏对中间表示有效性的结构保证，导致早期停止和自适应计算难以定义。

Method: 提出Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST)，引入分形归纳偏置以确保状态空间模型中潜变量动力学的尺度一致性，并进行几何分析证明其收缩性与稳定收敛性。

Result: 在ImageNet-100上的实验验证了尺度一致行为，表明自适应效率源于对齐的潜在几何结构。

Conclusion: 尺度一致的表示结构为自适应计算提供了内在依据，使停止决策可基于特征质量而非外部目标。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.

TL;DR: 本文提出AROMMA框架，通过化学基础模型和注意力聚合器，统一学习单分子与双分子混合物的气味表征，并利用知识蒸馏和类感知伪标签对齐气味描述符，显著提升单分子及混合物预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共嗅觉数据集规模小、分散，难以学习泛化性强的气味表征；已有方法将单分子与混合物表征分离，缺乏统一与对齐。

Method: 提出AROMMA框架：用化学基础模型编码单分子，用置换不变且能建模非对称分子相互作用的注意力聚合器组合双分子；通过知识蒸馏和类感知伪标签对齐并补全混合物的气味描述符标注。

Result: 在单分子和双分子混合物数据集上均达到SOTA性能，AUROC最高提升19.1%，验证了跨两类任务的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AROMMA成功构建了统一、对齐、可泛化的气味嵌入空间，为嗅觉计算与分子感知建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented across single molecules and mixtures, limiting learning of generalizable odor representations. Recent works either learn single-molecule embeddings or address mixtures via similarity or pairwise label prediction, leaving representations separate and unaligned. In this work, we propose AROMMA, a framework that learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures. Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需人工标注数据的领域自适应方法DGRC，利用教师与学生在推理路径上的分歧，动态构建原子级知识和验证后的思维链双课程，提升学生模型在专业领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法易导致学生模型粗粒度模仿教师，甚至继承其推理错误；而教师本身并非完美专家，如何设计可靠的学习课程成为关键挑战。

Method: 提出Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum（DGRC）：当师生推理结果不一致时，教师诊断分歧点，生成高置信度的原子问答对，构成原子知识课程；同时用这些原子对筛选并验证原始推理链，形成可信的思维链（CoT）课程。

Result: 在医疗与法律领域实验表明，DGRC显著提升各尺寸学生模型性能，尤其在医疗领域使1.5B模型相较强无标签基线获得7.76%相对提升。

Conclusion: DGRC通过利用LLM在原子任务上的高保真性，将分歧转化为教学信号，实现了更鲁棒、可解释的无监督领域适配。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于混合整数优化（MIO）的统一框架，用于训练兼具交叉公平性与内在可解释性的分类器，以满足高风险领域对AI模型公平透明的监管要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险领域（如金融、医疗）对AI模型的公平性和透明性有严格要求，而现行法规（如欧盟AI法案）对‘偏见’定义模糊；同时，现有研究强调需在受保护群体的交叉维度上解决偏见问题。

Method: 提出基于混合整数优化（MIO）的统一建模框架，训练既满足交叉公平性（通过MSD与SPSF两种度量等价性保障）又具备内在可解释性的分类器。

Result: 证明了MSD与SPSF两种交叉公平性度量在识别最不公平子群上的等价性，并通过实验验证所提MIO算法在检测和缓解交叉偏见方面性能更优；成功训练出高性能、可解释且交叉偏见可控的分类器。

Conclusion: 该框架为受监管行业提供了一种兼顾公平性、可解释性与实用性的鲁棒AI建模方案，并具有跨领域推广潜力。

Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种测度论框架来分析InfoNCE对比学习的几何机制，揭示了单模态与多模态场景下表征分布演化的本质差异：单模态下景观严格凸，均匀性仅为对齐盆地内的约束扩展；多模态下存在固有负对称散度，导致结构性模态间隙。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对InfoNCE的理解局限于对齐-均匀性分解，其深层几何机制（尤其在不同模态设定下）尚未被充分刻画。

Method: 构建基于嵌入流形上表示测度演化的测度论框架；通过大批次极限下的值与梯度一致性，将随机目标映射到确定性能量景观；分析单模态与对称多模态目标下的景观几何性质。

Result: 发现单模态下内在景观严格凸、具唯一Gibbs均衡，熵仅起平局作用；多模态下存在无法通过核锐化消除的负对称散度项，引发势垒驱动的协同适应，并强制产生群体层面的模态间隙。

Conclusion: 对比学习的本质应从点级判别转向群体几何分析；该框架为诊断和调控分布错位提供了原理性基础。

Abstract: While InfoNCE powers modern contrastive learning, its geometric mechanisms remain under-characterized beyond the canonical alignment--uniformity decomposition. We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying "uniformity" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出R^3强化学习机制，通过跨上下文重放、上下文内自反思和结构熵排序奖励三方面改进大型推理模型训练，显著提升数学推理任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于组的策略优化方法在处理复杂任务时因组内优势崩溃而变得脆弱低效，需解决训练不稳定和效率低的问题。

Method: 提出R^3机制：(1) 跨上下文重放策略，从同一查询的历史轨迹中召回有价值样本以维持组内优势；(2) 上下文内自反思机制，利用过往失败改进输出；(3) 结构熵排序奖励，基于token级熵模式对截断或失败样本进行相对奖励，兼顾局部探索与全局稳定性。

Result: 在Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型和DeepscaleR-40k数据集上验证，R^3在多个数学基准测试中达到SOTA性能，推理token更少、效果更好。

Conclusion: R^3有效缓解了组内优势崩溃问题，提升了大型推理模型在复杂任务中的训练稳定性与推理效率，为无需过程标注的强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.

TL;DR: 本文提出AES（自适应熵调度）方法，通过在线观测环境漂移信号动态调整熵系数，以在环境稳定时减少过度探索、在发生漂移时加快恢复，显著提升非平稳环境下的强化学习鲁棒性与适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的强化学习常面临环境漂移问题，而现有方法多采用静态熵系数，导致稳定期过探索、漂移后欠探索且恢复慢，缺乏依据漂移程度动态调节探索强度的原则性方案。

Method: 理论证明非平稳环境下熵调度可归约为单维轮次权衡问题（快速跟踪最优解 vs 避免冗余随机性），并基于可观测的在线漂移代理信号，设计轻量级自适应熵系数/温度调整机制（AES），无需大幅修改算法结构。

Result: 在4种算法变体、12项任务和4类漂移模式下，AES显著降低了漂移引发的性能下降比例，并加速了突变后的性能恢复。

Conclusion: AES为非平稳强化学习提供了一种原理清晰、实现简单、开销极低的自适应探索调控框架，有效解决了探索强度与漂移幅度匹配的关键问题。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning often faces environment drift, but most existing methods rely on static entropy coefficients/target entropy, causing over-exploration during stable periods and under-exploration after drift (thus slow recovery), and leaving unanswered the principled question of how exploration intensity should scale with drift magnitude. We prove that entropy scheduling under non-stationarity can be reduced to a one-dimensional, round-by-round trade-off, faster tracking of the optimal solution after drift vs. avoiding gratuitous randomness when the environment is stable, so exploration strength can be driven by measurable online drift signals. Building on this, we propose AES (Adaptive Entropy Scheduling), which adaptively adjusts the entropy coefficient/temperature online using observable drift proxies during training, requiring almost no structural changes and incurring minimal overhead. Across 4 algorithm variants, 12 tasks, and 4 drift modes, AES significantly reduces the fraction of performance degradation caused by drift and accelerates recovery after abrupt changes.

*Luis Amorim,Moises Santos,Paulo J. Azevedo,Carlos Soares,Vitor Cerqueira*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Grasynda，一种基于图的合成时间序列生成方法，通过将单变量时间序列转化为图结构并编码其时序动态，在多个基准数据集上验证了其作为数据增强方法的有效性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中常缺乏大规模时间序列数据，而现有数据增强方法在保持时间序列固有特性方面存在不足。

Method: Grasynda将单变量时间序列建模为有向图（节点为状态、边为状态转移），并用转移概率矩阵刻画其时序动态，从而生成合成时间序列。

Result: 在六个基准数据集和三种神经网络模型上的实验表明，Grasynda作为数据增强方法持续优于其他方法，包括当前先进的时间序列基础模型所采用的方法。

Conclusion: Grasynda是一种有效且通用的时间序列数据增强新范式，兼顾结构建模与动态保持，代码与实验全部开源。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial tool in time series forecasting, especially for deep learning architectures that require a large training sample size to generalize effectively. However, extensive datasets are not always available in real-world scenarios. Although many data augmentation methods exist, their limitations include the use of transformations that do not adequately preserve data properties. This paper introduces Grasynda, a novel graph-based approach for synthetic time series generation that: (1) converts univariate time series into a network structure using a graph representation, where each state is a node and each transition is represented as a directed edge; and (2) encodes their temporal dynamics in a transition probability matrix. We performed an extensive evaluation of Grasynda as a data augmentation method for time series forecasting. We use three neural network variations on six benchmark datasets. The results indicate that Grasynda consistently outperforms other time series data augmentation methods, including ones used in state-of-the-art time series foundation models. The method and all experiments are publicly available.

*Waris Gill,Ahmad Humayun,Ali Anwar,Muhammad Ali Gulzar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出ProToken方法，用于在联邦学习的大型语言模型中实现词元级别的客户端溯源，以解决生成响应时无法确定贡献客户端的问题。该方法利用Transformer架构后期块集中任务信号的特点和基于梯度的相关性加权技术，在保证隐私的前提下实现了高精度的客户端归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当联邦学习的大型语言模型部署于关键应用时，难以确定具体生成响应的客户端，这阻碍了调试、恶意客户端识别、公平奖励分配及信任验证。

Method: ProToken是一种新型的词元级溯源方法，利用两个关键洞察：(1) Transformer架构在后期层集中任务特定信号，从而选择合适层以提升计算可行性；(2) 基于梯度的相关性加权过滤无关神经激活，聚焦影响词元生成的关键神经元。

Result: ProToken在涵盖4种LLM架构（Gemma、Llama、Qwen、SmolLM）和4个领域（医疗、金融、数学、编程）的16种配置中评估，平均归因准确率达98%，且在客户端数量扩展时仍保持高准确率。

Conclusion: ProToken有效解决了联邦大模型中词元级客户端溯源难题，在满足隐私约束的同时具备高准确性与可扩展性，适用于真实场景部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.

*Dominic Weisser,Chloé Hashimoto-Cullen,Benjamin Guedj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于气象特征聚类的迁移学习框架，用于解决新建海上风电场因缺乏长期本地数据而导致功率预测不准的问题；该方法通过训练多个针对不同天气模式的专家模型，在仅需不到5个月现场数据的情况下实现了高精度跨域预测（MAE为3.52%），并消除了行业对一年本地观测数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新建海上风电场缺乏足够的历史功率与气象数据，而现有高性能机器学习模型依赖大量站点特异性数据，导致初期功率预测困难，影响电网稳定、备用管理和能源交易。

Method: 提出一种新颖的迁移学习框架：根据协变量（气象特征）对风电功率输出进行聚类，为每个聚类训练一个专家模型，形成专家模型集成；利用预训练模型对气候相关动态的可迁移性，实现对新站点的快速适配，并内置对季节性和气象变化的校准机制。

Result: 在八个海上风电场上的实验表明，该方法仅需不到五个月的站点特有数据即可实现准确的跨域功率预测，平均绝对误差（MAE）为3.52%，验证了无需完整年度数据也可获得可靠预测。

Conclusion: 该气候感知的迁移学习框架不仅提升了新建风电场早期功率预测的准确性与实用性，还拓展至风资源评估等前期开发环节，有助于加速项目落地并降低风险。

Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.

*Hongyaoxing Gu,Lijuan Hu,Liye Yu,Haowei Li,Fangfang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出LoPRo，一种无需微调的后训练量化（PTQ）算法，通过分块置换与Walsh-Hadamard变换优化残差矩阵量化，并结合秩-1草图（R1SVD）实现混合精度低秩分解，在2/3比特下显著提升大模型量化精度与速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有子3比特权重PTQ方法常因残差矩阵量化困难导致精度大幅下降，通常需微调；本文旨在不依赖微调的前提下，从根本上改进低比特权重量化效果。

Method: 提出LoPRo算法：1）对低秩近似中的残差矩阵实施分块列置换与Walsh-Hadamard旋转，使相似重要性列对齐；2）显式保护最显著列块的量化精度；3）引入基于秩-1草图（R1SVD）的混合精度快速低秩分解以降低量化开销。

Result: 在LLaMA-2/3和Mixtral-8x7B上，LoPRo在2/3比特下超越所有无微调PTQ方法，精度媲美微调基线；LLaMA系列达SOTA；Mixtral-8x7B量化仅需2.5小时，困惑度↓0.4、准确率↑8%；相比其他低秩量化方法，以更低秩获得更高精度，且推理高效、延迟低。

Conclusion: LoPRo通过结构化残差量化与高效低秩分解，实现了无需微调的高性能低比特PTQ，在精度、速度与部署友好性上取得统一突破，为大模型边缘部署提供了实用新路径。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\%$\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单模态大语言模型知识编辑方法在多模态场景下存在因果欠拟合与过拟合问题，难以应对跨模态提示下的语义与事实变化。

Result: 理论分析与大量实验验证了ODEdit在编辑可靠性、局部性和泛化性上的有效性。

Conclusion: 将MLLM知识编辑建模为OOD泛化问题并引入不变因果学习，是提升其鲁棒编辑能力的有效范式。

Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

*Kaifeng Zhang,Kai Ming Ting,Tianrun Liang,Qiuran Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文指出当前基于目标的分裂层次聚类（DHC）方法存在三个缺陷，根源在于使用了集合导向的二分评估准则；作者提出改用分布核替代该准则，从而最大化所有簇的总相似度（TSC），理论证明新方法能保证TSC下界，实验验证其在人工和空间转录组数据上的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DHC方法生成的树状图缺乏三个理想性质：无不当分裂、相似簇被归入同一子集、与真实标签一致，其根本原因在于采用集合导向的二分评估准则。

Method: 引入分布核替代传统的集合导向二分评估准则，提出一种新分布导向目标——最大化所有簇的总相似度（TSC），并构建相应算法。

Result: 理论分析证明新方法生成的树状图能保证TSC的下界；实验表明其在人工数据和空间转录组数据上均优于对比方法，尤其在生物区域划分上与真实生物学结构高度一致。

Conclusion: 分布核驱动的DHC方法能有效克服现有方法的根本缺陷，实现更合理、可解释且符合生物学意义的层次聚类。

Abstract: We uncover that current objective-based Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) methods produce a dendrogram that does not have three desired properties i.e., no unwarranted splitting, group similar clusters into a same subset, ground-truth correspondence. This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Instant Retrospect Action (IRA)的在线强化学习算法，通过Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE)、Greedy Action Guidance (GAG) 和 Instant Policy Update (IPU) 机制，提升策略探索效率与更新速度，并缓解值函数高估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于值的在线强化学习算法因探索低效和策略更新延迟，导致策略利用缓慢。

Method: 提出IRA算法，包含三个核心组件：1）Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution（RDE）以增强Q网络对邻近状态-动作对的判别表征；2）Greedy Action Guidance（GAG），通过回溯历史动作施加显式策略约束；3）Instant Policy Update（IPU），提高策略更新频率。此外，利用k近邻动作值估计辅助策略学习，并发现早期训练保守性可缓解过估计偏差。

Result: 在八个MuJoCo连续控制任务上，IRA显著提升了在线RL算法的学习效率和最终性能。

Conclusion: IRA通过改进表征学习、策略约束与更新机制，有效解决了在线值函数RL中探索不足与更新滞后问题，同时缓解了过估计偏差，是一种高效且实用的在线强化学习方法。

Abstract: Existing value-based online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from slow policy exploitation due to ineffective exploration and delayed policy updates. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: 重尾梯度噪声下的算法稳定性可有效支撑泛化分析，所提框架为理解深度学习等模型在现实噪声下的泛化行为提供了新工具。

Abstract: The empirical evidence indicates that stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise is more appropriate to characterize the training of machine learning models than that with standard bounded gradient variance noise. Most existing works on this phenomenon focus on the convergence of optimization errors, while the analysis for generalization bounds under the heavy-tailed gradient noise remains limited. In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants.

TL;DR: 本文提出GraphDLG方法，首次系统研究并实现了从联邦图学习（FGL）共享梯度中恢复原始图结构和节点特征，揭示了FGL中深层梯度泄露（DLG）的新风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DLG攻击主要针对图像或文本数据，而图数据在GNN中结构与特征高度耦合，其可恢复性尚属未知，存在未被充分认识的隐私风险。

Method: 理论分析FGL中梯度对图结构与特征的依赖关系，发现结构恢复后特征可通过闭式递推求解；据此设计GraphDLG攻击框架，支持使用随机图或客户端本地图作为辅助先验提升恢复效果。

Conclusion: 证明了FGL中存在严重的梯度泄露风险，GraphDLG为评估和增强FGL隐私安全提供了新基准与警示。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习在实践中表现出色，但其理论基础仍薄弱，尤其是对真正深层网络如何通过梯度法有效利用数据层次结构缺乏严格证明。

Method: 基于随机层次模型（Random Hierarchy Models），提出并证明：若中间层能从标签获得干净信号且相关特征弱可识别，则逐层训练各层即可实现分层学习。

Result: 在温和条件下，深度卷积网络可通过梯度法（特别是逐层训练）被高效训练以准确学习该模型类。

Conclusion: 该工作为深度网络为何及如何实现层次化学习提供了首个理论保证，填补了深层网络优化理论的关键空白。

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to deep networks' ability to exploit hierarchical structure in data, constructing increasingly complex features across layers. Yet despite substantial progress in deep learning theory, most optimization results sill focus on networks with only two or three layers, leaving the theoretical understanding of hierarchical learning in genuinely deep models limited. This leads to a natural question: can we prove that deep networks, trained by gradient-based methods, can efficiently exploit hierarchical structure?
  In this work, we consider Random Hierarchy Models -- a hierarchical context-free grammar introduced by arXiv:2307.02129 and conjectured to separate deep and shallow networks. We prove that, under mild conditions, a deep convolutional network can be efficiently trained to learn this function class. Our proof builds on a general observation: if intermediate layers can receive clean signal from the labels and the relevant features are weakly identifiable, then layerwise training each individual layer suffices to hierarchically learn the target function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态架构模型在数据分布随任务演进时难以适应，易发生灾难性遗忘，需从理论层面理解架构在持续学习中的作用及其对遗忘的影响。

Method: 在Sobolev空间中联合建模架构与权重；构建双层优化框架（上层搜索最优架构，下层通过动态规划优化权重）；提出无导数直接搜索算法求解上层问题；设计低秩转移机制以跨维度迁移知识。

Result: 在回归与分类任务（含全连接、卷积及图神经网络）上，相较静态架构方法，性能提升达两个数量级，遗忘显著降低，抗噪鲁棒性增强。

Conclusion: 仅更新权重不足以缓解分布偏移下的灾难性遗忘；同步学习架构与权重是必要且有效的策略，所提框架为持续学习提供了新的理论基础与实用算法。

Abstract: Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.
  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.

Conclusion: FedKACE有效应对流式联邦持续学习中的类别重叠与无任务标识挑战，提升了跨轮知识保留与模型泛化-个性化平衡能力。

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE.

TL;DR: 本文在岭回归框架下研究了'顿悟'现象，即模型在过拟合后长时间才开始泛化。作者从理论上证明了梯度下降配合权重衰减训练过参数化线性回归时会出现顿悟，并给出了顿悟时间（泛化延迟）关于超参数的定量界；同时通过实验验证该理论也适用于非线性神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习中'顿悟'（grokking）这一反直觉现象——模型在训练初期快速过拟合、随后长期泛化性能停滞，最终却突然获得良好泛化能力——的内在机制及其与训练条件的关系。

Method: 在过参数化线性回归设定下，采用带权重衰减的梯度下降进行优化，通过理论分析（推导泛化误差演化过程）和数值实验相结合的方式，建立顿悟时间与学习率、权重衰减系数等超参数之间的定量关系。

Result: 首次给出了顿悟时间（generalization delay）的严格定量上界；证明顿悟并非模型本质缺陷，而是可被超参数调控的现象：适当调优可放大或消除顿悟；且该理论规律在非线性神经网络中亦有经验一致性。

Conclusion: 顿悟不是深度学习固有的失败模式，而是一种由特定训练条件（如超参数配置）引发的可控现象，无需修改模型结构或学习算法本身即可避免或利用。

Abstract: We study grokking, the onset of generalization long after overfitting, in a classical ridge regression setting. We prove end-to-end grokking results for learning over-parameterized linear regression models using gradient descent with weight decay. Specifically, we prove that the following stages occur: (i) the model overfits the training data early during training; (ii) poor generalization persists long after overfitting has manifested; and (iii) the generalization error eventually becomes arbitrarily small. Moreover, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that grokking can be amplified or eliminated in a principled manner through proper hyperparameter tuning. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous quantitative bounds on the generalization delay (which we refer to as the "grokking time") in terms of training hyperparameters. Lastly, going beyond the linear setting, we empirically demonstrate that our quantitative bounds also capture the behavior of grokking on non-linear neural networks. Our results suggest that grokking is not an inherent failure mode of deep learning, but rather a consequence of specific training conditions, and thus does not require fundamental changes to the model architecture or learning algorithm to avoid.

*Ganesh Sundaram,Jonas Ulmen,Daniel Görges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向多组件神经架构的组件感知剪枝框架，利用梯度信息（梯度累积、Fisher信息、贝叶斯不确定性）动态评估参数重要性，优于传统基于范数的静态剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于范数的结构化剪枝方法难以捕捉参数的功能重要性，尤其在多组件神经网络控制器中，静态启发式方法无法反映重要性的动态变化和结构依赖关系。

Method: 提出组件感知剪枝框架，在训练过程中利用梯度信息计算三种重要性指标：梯度累积、Fisher信息和贝叶斯不确定性，以动态识别关键参数和结构依赖。

Result: 在自编码器和TD-MPC智能体上的实验表明，该框架能揭示传统静态方法忽略的关键结构依赖与重要性动态变化，从而支持更精准的模型压缩决策。

Conclusion: 基于梯度的多指标重要性评估比传统范数方法更能反映参数的功能意义，提升了多组件神经网络压缩的合理性与有效性。

Abstract: The transition from monolithic to multi-component neural architectures in advanced neural network controllers poses substantial challenges due to the high computational complexity of the latter. Conventional model compression techniques for complexity reduction, such as structured pruning based on norm-based metrics to estimate the relative importance of distinct parameter groups, often fail to capture functional significance. This paper introduces a component-aware pruning framework that utilizes gradient information to compute three distinct importance metrics during training: Gradient Accumulation, Fisher Information, and Bayesian Uncertainty. Experimental results with an autoencoder and a TD-MPC agent demonstrate that the proposed framework reveals critical structural dependencies and dynamic shifts in importance that static heuristics often miss, supporting more informed compression decisions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种“学习与验证”（Learn and Verify）框架，结合双平滑最大值（DSM）损失函数与区间算术，为基于神经网络求解微分方程的方法（如PINNs）提供可计算、数学上严格的后验误差界，从而提升科学机器学习的可信性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经网络的微分方程求解方法（如PINNs）缺乏严格的误差界和收敛保证，且优化过程具有不确定性，难以进行数学认证。

Method: 提出“学习与验证”框架：训练阶段采用新型双平滑最大值（DSM）损失函数；验证阶段利用区间算术进行严格后验误差分析，生成机器可验证的数学证明。

Result: 在多个非线性常微分方程（含时变系数和有限时间爆破问题）上成功构造了真解的严格包含区间，验证了框架的有效性与严谨性。

Conclusion: 该框架为科学机器学习提供了可信赖的理论与计算基础，首次实现了对PINN类方法解的数学可验证误差控制。

Abstract: The numerical solution of differential equations using neural networks has become a central topic in scientific computing, with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) emerging as a powerful paradigm for both forward and inverse problems. However, unlike classical numerical methods that offer established convergence guarantees, neural network-based approximations typically lack rigorous error bounds. Furthermore, the non-deterministic nature of their optimization makes it difficult to mathematically certify their accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a "Learn and Verify" framework that provides computable, mathematically rigorous error bounds for the solutions of differential equations. By combining a novel Doubly Smoothed Maximum (DSM) loss for training with interval arithmetic for verification, we compute rigorous a posteriori error bounds as machine-verifiable proofs. Numerical experiments on nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), including problems with time-varying coefficients and finite-time blow-up, demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully constructs rigorous enclosures of the true solutions, establishing a foundation for trustworthy scientific machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多方向元学习算法，用于类别泛化型异常检测，通过在正常数据上学习表征、在少量标注异常样本上校准决策边界，实现对未见异常类的强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类别泛化型异常检测问题，即仅利用正常数据和极少量标注异常数据，检测完全未见过的异常类别（OOD），同时应对异常样本稀少且标注成本高的挑战。

Method: 提出多方向元学习框架：内层学习正常数据流形（表征学习）；外层利用少量异常样本进行元调优，最大化正常与异常样本间的softmax置信度间隔（决策面校准），将正常样本视为ID、异常样本视为OOD，并通过多轮ID主导+少量OOD的训练任务迭代优化。

Result: 该两层优化框架显著提升了模型对未见异常类别的泛化能力，在类别泛化型异常检测任务中取得更优性能。

Conclusion: 多方向元学习能有效协同表征学习与决策面校准，是解决小样本、类别泛化型异常检测问题的有效范式。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.

Abstract: Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图变换器（Graph Transformer）的深度学习模型，能够从颅内动脉瘤（IA）表面网格实时预测整个心动周期的壁面剪切应力（WSS），无需耗时的计算流体力学（CFD）模拟；该模型融合时间信息、利用稳态CFD数据增强训练，在小规模脉动CFD数据下仍取得高精度（SSIM达0.981，相对L2误差2.8%），为临床转化提供了可行路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFD虽能提供反映颅内动脉瘤进展风险的流体力学指标（如WSS），但因依赖专家、耗时低效，难以在临床中应用；亟需一种快速、自动、无需CFD的替代方法。

Method: 提出一种融合时间信息的图变换器模型，以IA表面网格为输入，预测全心动周期WSS分布；采用稳态CFD数据作为低成本数据增强策略，缓解脉动CFD数据稀缺问题；通过SSIM和相对L2误差评估性能，并开展消融实验与SOTA对比。

Result: 模型在WSS时空预测上达到SSIM最高0.981、最大相对L2误差仅2.8%；稳态CFD增强显著提升小样本脉动CFD下的性能；消融与SOTA对比验证了模型最优性。

Conclusion: 证明了仅凭几何网格即可用深度学习实时预测心血管时序流体力学参数的可行性，尤其适用于脉动CFD数据稀缺场景，具有向其他心血管疾病拓展的潜力。

Abstract: Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为自蒸馏微调（SDFT）的新方法，通过利用上下文学习，使模型能直接从专家示范中进行在线策略学习，从而在持续学习中有效减少灾难性遗忘并提升新任务准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习对基础模型至关重要，但现有方法如监督微调（SFT）是离线策略的，而在线策略强化学习又依赖难以获得的显式奖励函数。

Method: 提出自蒸馏微调（SDFT），利用示范条件化模型作为自身教师，通过上下文学习生成在线策略训练信号。

Result: SDFT在技能学习与知识获取任务中始终优于SFT，显著提升新任务准确率并大幅缓解灾难性遗忘；在顺序学习实验中，单个模型可随时间累积多个技能而不出现性能退化。

Conclusion: SDFT为基于示范的持续学习提供了一种实用的在线策略蒸馏路径。

Abstract: Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.

Abstract: High-quality motion data underpins games, film, XR, and robotics. Vision-based motion capture tools have made significant progress, offering accessible and visually convincing results, yet often fall short in the final stretch -- the last mile -- when it comes to physical realism and production readiness, due to various artifacts introduced during capture. In this paper, we summarize key issues through case studies and feedback from professional animators to set a stepping stone for future research in motion cleanup. We then present a physics-based motion refinement framework to bridge the gap, with the goal of reducing labor-intensive manual cleanup and enhancing visual quality and physical realism. Our framework supports both single- and multi-character sequences and can be integrated into animator workflows for further refinement, such as stylizing motions via keyframe editing.

Abstract: Joint rendering and deformation of mesh and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significant value as both representa tions offer complementary advantages for graphics applica tions. However, due to differences in representation and ren dering pipelines, existing studies render meshes and 3DGS separately, making it difficult to accurately handle occlusions and transparency. Moreover, the deformed 3DGS still suffers from visual artifacts due to the sensitivity to the topology quality of the proxy mesh. These issues pose serious obsta cles to the joint use of 3DGS and meshes, making it diffi cult to adapt 3DGS to conventional mesh-oriented graphics pipelines. We propose UniMGS, the first unified framework for rasterizing mesh and 3DGS in a single-pass anti-aliased manner, with a novel binding strategy for 3DGS deformation based on proxy mesh. Our key insight is to blend the col ors of both triangle and Gaussian fragments by anti-aliased α-blending in a single pass, achieving visually coherent re sults with precise handling of occlusion and transparency. To improve the visual appearance of the deformed 3DGS, our Gaussian-centric binding strategy employs a proxy mesh and spatially associates Gaussians with the mesh faces, signifi cantly reducing rendering artifacts. With these two compo nents, UniMGS enables the visualization and manipulation of 3D objects represented by mesh or 3DGS within a unified framework, opening up new possibilities in embodied AI, vir tual reality, and gaming. We will release our source code to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文研究了在虚拟现实（VR）中如何利用重量与压力作为触觉隐喻来支持用户界面通知，设计了一种可穿戴设备独立调控手背处的重量与压力，并发现压力虽能增强重量感知，但未提升通知紧迫感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究分别探索了无支撑重量模拟和气动反馈，但二者结合用于UI通知传递的作用尚未被充分研究。

Method: 开发了一种可穿戴触觉设备，通过向安装于手背的柔性容器注入液体和空气，独立调控重量与压力；开展三组条件（无反馈、仅重量、重量+压力）的初步实验评估。

Result: 压力能显著增强重量感知，但该增强的沉重感并未转化为更高的通知紧迫感。

Conclusion: 压力增强的重量可丰富VR中UI元素的触觉渲染效果，但其对紧迫感传达的有效性仍需进一步探索，例如尝试不同压力波形或通知类型。

Abstract: This work investigates how weight and pressure can function as haptic metaphors to support user interface notifications in Virtual Reality (VR). While prior research has explored ungrounded weight simulation and pneumatic feedback, their combined role in conveying information through UI elements remains underexplored. We developed a wearable haptic device that transfers liquid and air into flexible containers mounted on the back of the user's hand, allowing us to independently manipulate weight and pressure. Through an initial evaluation using three conditions-no feedback, weight only, and weight combined with pressure-we examined how these signals affect perceived heaviness, coherence with visual cues, and the perceived urgency of notifications. Our results validate that pressure amplifies the perception of weight, but this increased heaviness does not translate into higher perceived urgency. These findings suggest that while pressure___enhanced weight can enrich haptic rendering of UI elements in VR, its contribution to communicating urgency may require further investigation, alternative pressure profiles, or different types of notifications.

Conclusion: ClipGS-VR成功实现了在资源受限的消费级VR设备上进行高质量、实时、任意角度医学图像切片可视化。

Abstract: High-fidelity cinematic medical visualization on mobile virtual reality (VR) remains challenging. Although ClipGS enables cross-sectional exploration via 3D Gaussian Splatting, it lacks arbitrary-angle slicing on consumer-grade VR headsets. To achieve real-time interactive performance, we introduce ClipGS-VR and restructure ClipGS's neural inference into a consolidated dataset, integrating high-fidelity layers from multiple pre-computed slicing states into a unified rendering structure. Our framework further supports arbitrary-angle slicing via gradient-based opacity modulation for smooth, visually coherent rendering. Evaluations confirm our approach maintains visual fidelity comparable to offline results while offering superior usability and interaction efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像统计特性的高效合成方法，用于替代高计算成本的高频细节渲染，在保持感知质量的同时显著降低渲染开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新型显示设备需要高分辨率、宽视场渲染，但人眼外周视觉对空间细节敏感度低，因此需利用视觉感知局限性提升渲染效率。

Method: 基于图像局部统计特性（尤其是相位信息在空间与频率上的对齐），从注视区（foveated）内容中外推高频统计量，并合成补充信号叠加到低分辨率渲染结果上。

Result: 相比现有方案，该方法大幅减少了需精确渲染的内容量，仅需少量额外开销即可合成感知等价的高频细节。

Conclusion: 利用图像统计建模进行感知驱动的高频合成是一种有前景的轻量级渲染增强策略，可有效平衡视觉保真度与计算效率。

Abstract: Novel display technologies can deliver high-quality images across a wide field of view, creating immersive experiences. While rendering for such devices is expensive, most of the content falls into peripheral vision, where human perception differs from that in the fovea. Consequently, it is critical to understand and leverage the limitations of visual perception to enable efficient rendering. A standard approach is to exploit the reduced sensitivity to spatial details in the periphery by reducing rendering resolution, so-called foveated rendering. While this strategy avoids rendering part of the content altogether, an alternative promising direction is to replace accurate and expensive rendering with inexpensive synthesis of content that is perceptually indistinguishable from the ground-truth image. In this paper, we propose such a method for the efficient generation of an image signal that substitutes the rendering of high-frequency details. The method is grounded in findings from image statistics, which show that preserving appropriate local statistics is critical for perceived image quality. Based on this insight, we extrapolate several local image statistics from foveated content into higher spatial frequency ranges that are attenuated or omitted in the rendering process. This rich set of statistics is later used to synthesize a signal that is added to the initial rendering, boosting its perceived quality. We focus on phase information, demonstrating the importance of its alignment across space and frequencies. We calibrate and compare our method with state-of-the-art strategies, showing a significant reduction in the content that must be accurately rendered at a relatively small extra cost for synthesizing the additional signal.

Conclusion: GraphiXS是对当前4D高斯点绘范式的根本性拓展，将其推进至概率化建模新阶段，具备通用性与实用性。

Abstract: We propose a new framework to systematically incorporate data uncertainty in Gaussian Splatting. Being the new paradigm of neural rendering, Gaussian Splatting has been investigated in many applications, with the main effort in extending its representation, improving its optimization process, and accelerating its speed. However, one orthogonal, much needed, but under-explored area is data uncertainty. In standard 4D Gaussian Splatting, data uncertainty can manifest as view sparsity, missing frames, camera asynchronization, etc. So far, there has been little research to holistically incorporating various types of data uncertainty under a single framework. To this end, we propose Graphical X Splatting, or GraphiXS, a new probabilistic framework that considers multiple types of data uncertainty, aiming for a fundamental augmentation of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting paradigm into a probabilistic setting. GraphiXS is general and can be instantiated with a range of primitives, e.g. Gaussians, Student's-t. Furthermore, GraphiXS can be used to `upgrade' existing methods to accommodate data uncertainty. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we demonstrate that GraphiXS can systematically model various uncertainties in data, outperform existing methods in many settings where data are missing or polluted in space and time, and therefore is a major generalization of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting research.

Abstract: The software engineering research community faces a systemic crisis: peer review is failing under growing submissions, misaligned incentives, and reviewer fatigue. Community surveys reveal that researchers perceive the process as "broken." This position paper argues that these dysfunctions are mechanism design failures amenable to computational solutions. We propose modeling the research community as a stochastic multi-agent system and applying multi-agent reinforcement learning to design incentive-compatible protocols. We outline three interventions: a credit-based submission economy, MARL-optimized reviewer assignment, and hybrid verification of review consistency. We present threat models, equity considerations, and phased pilot metrics. This vision charts a research agenda toward sustainable peer review.

Method: Extends the Provence framework—originally integrating zero-cost context pruning into the re-ranking model—to multilingual settings using cross-lingual transfer, trained on 16 languages and evaluated on four multilingual QA benchmarks.

Result: XProvence prunes RAG contexts with minimal-to-no performance degradation and outperforms strong baselines across four multilingual question answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: XProvence successfully generalizes zero-cost context pruning to multilingual RAG, enabling efficient and effective retrieval-augmented generation across 100+ languages.

Abstract: This paper introduces XProvence, a multilingual zero-cost context pruning model for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), trained on 16 languages and supporting 100+ languages through effective cross-lingual transfer. Motivated by the growing use of RAG systems across diverse languages, we explore several strategies to generalize the Provence framework-which first integrated efficient zero-cost context pruning directly into the re-ranking model-beyond English. Across four multilingual question answering benchmarks, we show how XProvence can prune RAG contexts with minimal-to-no performance degradation and outperforms strong baselines.

Motivation: 随着应用场景日益复杂，传统推荐系统难以有效处理多层级用户偏好（如原子项与复合项）及领域知识（如风格适配性），亟需更复杂的推荐技术。

Method: 提出JIMA方法，采用单一模型联合建模不同粒度的数据，显式建模原子项、复合项之间的用户偏好交互，并融合领域专家知识。

Abstract: With the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, recommender systems have been increasingly used across a vast variety of platforms to efficiently and effectively match users with items. As application contexts become more diverse and complex, there is a growing need for more sophisticated recommendation techniques. One example is the composite item (for example, fashion outfit) recommendation where multiple levels of user preference information might be available and relevant. In this study, we propose JIMA, a joint interaction modeling approach that uses a single model to take advantage of all data from different levels of granularity and incorporate interactions to learn the complex relationships among lower-order (atomic item) and higher-order (composite item) user preferences as well as domain expertise (e.g., on the stylistic fit). We comprehensively evaluate the proposed method and compare it with advanced baselines through multiple simulation studies as well as with real data in both offline and online settings. The results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了RobustExplain框架，首次系统评估大语言模型（LLM）在推荐系统中生成自然语言解释的鲁棒性，针对真实用户行为噪声设计五类扰动，并构建多维鲁棒性指标；实验表明当前LLM解释稳定性有限，模型规模提升仅带来小幅鲁棒性改善（最高+8%），凸显鲁棒性对可信推荐代理的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实Web平台中用户交互历史存在点击噪声、时间不一致、缺失值和偏好漂移等固有噪声，而现有工作未充分考察LLM生成解释对此类噪声的鲁棒性，影响解释稳定性和用户信任。

Method: 提出RobustExplain评估框架，设计五种贴近真实场景的用户行为扰动（如意外点击、时间错乱等），在多级严重程度下测试；定义涵盖语义、关键词、结构和长度一致性的多维鲁棒性度量；在四个典型LLM（7B–70B）上开展实验。

Result: 当前LLM解释鲁棒性仅为中等水平，更大参数量模型最多提升8%稳定性；首次建立解释代理鲁棒性基准，揭示鲁棒性是大规模可信推荐代理系统的关键维度。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性是评估推荐系统中LLM解释代理可信度不可或缺的新维度；RobustExplain为该方向提供了首个系统性评估框架与基线，推动未来研究关注噪声下的稳定推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural-language explanations in recommender systems, acting as explanation agents that reason over user behavior histories. While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统在处理硬性业务约束（如公平性、覆盖率）时表现不佳，常将约束视为软惩罚，导致生产环境中频繁违规；而LLM在推荐中的协调优化作用尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出DualAgent-Rec：由专注准确率与硬约束满足的Exploitation Agent和专注多样性与无约束Pareto搜索的Exploration Agent组成；LLM作为协调器自适应分配资源，并引入自适应epsilon松弛机制保障解的可行性。

Result: 在Amazon Reviews 2023数据集上，DualAgent-Rec实现100%约束满足，Pareto超体积提升4–6%，同时保持良好的准确性-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: LLM可作为高效编排代理，支撑可部署、强约束合规的推荐系统。

Abstract: Recommendation systems must optimize multiple objectives while satisfying hard business constraints such as fairness and coverage. For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.

Experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that, compared to the influential HSTU model, our approach achieves up to a 6x reduction in computational cost and up to 39% higher accuracy at comparable cost (i.e., similar sequence length).

Motivation: 现有推荐系统的评估方法主要依赖传统准确率指标，无法全面反映影响真实用户体验的人本化特性。

Method: 提出HELM框架，涵盖五个核心人本化评估维度，并在电影、图书、餐厅三个领域，使用GPT-4、LLaMA-3.1和P5三种先进LLM推荐器，由12位领域专家对847个推荐场景进行严格评估。

Result: 实验表明GPT-4在解释质量和交互自然性上表现最优（分别为4.21/5.0和4.35/5.0），但存在显著流行度偏差（基尼系数0.73），高于传统协同过滤（0.58）；HELM能揭示传统指标无法发现的关键质量问题。

Conclusion: HELM为LLM驱动的推荐系统提供了系统化、可扩展的人本化评估范式，已开源以推动推荐系统社区向更以人为本的评估实践演进。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommendation systems has introduced unprecedented capabilities for natural language understanding, explanation generation, and conversational interactions. However, existing evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on traditional accuracy metrics, failing to capture the multifaceted human-centered qualities that determine the real-world user experience. We introduce \framework{} (\textbf{H}uman-centered \textbf{E}valuation for \textbf{L}LM-powered reco\textbf{M}menders), a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses LLM-powered recommender systems across five human-centered dimensions: \textit{Intent Alignment}, \textit{Explanation Quality}, \textit{Interaction Naturalness}, \textit{Trust \& Transparency}, and \textit{Fairness \& Diversity}. Through extensive experiments involving three state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders (GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1, and P5) across three domains (movies, books, and restaurants), and rigorous evaluation by 12 domain experts using 847 recommendation scenarios, we demonstrate that \framework{} reveals critical quality dimensions invisible to traditional metrics. Our results show that while GPT-4 achieves superior explanation quality (4.21/5.0) and interaction naturalness (4.35/5.0), it exhibits a significant popularity bias (Gini coefficient 0.73) compared to traditional collaborative filtering (0.58). We release \framework{} as an open-source toolkit to advance human-centered evaluation practices in the recommender systems community.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视模态特异性不确定性，且未利用用户与物品间的丰富相似性模式来优化表征及其不确定性估计。

Method: 提出SPUMR框架：首先构建模态相似图和协同相似图以分别从内容和行为角度优化表征；再通过不确定性感知的偏好聚合模块自适应融合多模态特征。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，SPUMR显著优于现有主流方法。

Conclusion: SPUMR有效建模并缓解多模态推荐中的不确定性，提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Recommendation (MMR) systems are crucial for modern platforms but are often hampered by inherent noise and uncertainty in modal features, such as blurry images, diverse visual appearances, or ambiguous text. Existing methods often overlook this modality-specific uncertainty, leading to ineffective feature fusion. Furthermore, they fail to leverage rich similarity patterns among users and items to refine representations and their corresponding uncertainty estimates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Similarity Propagation-enhanced Uncertainty for Multimodal Recommendation (SPUMR). SPUMR explicitly models and mitigates uncertainty by first constructing the Modality Similarity Graph and the Collaborative Similarity Graph to refine representations from both content and behavioral perspectives. The Uncertainty-aware Preference Aggregation module then adaptively fuses the refined multimodal features, assigning greater weight to more reliable modalities. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPUMR achieves significant improvements over existing leading methods.

Conclusion: 将物理规律（营养科学）显式融入推荐系统架构，可有效弥补传统协同过滤在健康约束建模上的结构性缺陷，实现更安全、个性化的营养电商推荐。

Abstract: Traditional e-commerce recommender systems primarily optimize for user engagement and purchase likelihood, often neglecting the rigid physiological constraints required for human health. Standard collaborative filtering algorithms are structurally blind to these hard limits, frequently suggesting bundles that fail to meet specific total daily energy expenditure and macronutrient balance requirements. To address this disconnect, this paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neuro-Symbolic Recommender System that integrates nutritional science directly into the recommendation pipeline via a dual-layer architecture. The framework begins by constructing a semantic knowledge graph using sentence-level encoders to strictly align commercial products with authoritative nutritional data. During the training phase, an implicit physics regularizer applies a differentiable thermodynamic loss function, ensuring that learned latent embeddings reflect nutritional plausibility rather than simple popularity. Subsequently, during the inference phase, an explicit physics optimizer employs simulated annealing and elastic quantity optimization to generate discrete grocery bundles that strictly adhere to the user's protein and caloric targets.

TL;DR: 本文提出Talos损失函数，通过分位数技术简化Top-K推荐精度优化，避免复杂排序操作，提升效率与分布鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统在优化Top-K指标（如Precision@K、Recall@K）时面临计算开销大、难以直接优化、且易受用户偏好变化和数据偏置导致的分布偏移影响等问题。

Method: 提出Talos损失函数，采用分位数技术将排名依赖操作转化为预测分数与学习阈值的简单比较；设计基于采样的回归算法高效估计阈值；引入约束项防止分数膨胀以保障优化稳定性；并使用定制代理函数缓解不连续性、增强对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析与实验验证表明Talos在有效性、效率、收敛性及分布鲁棒性方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Talos是一种面向Top-K推荐精度优化的高效、稳定且分布鲁棒的新损失函数，为推荐系统训练提供了更实用的优化目标。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) aim to retrieve a small set of items that best match individual user preferences. Naturally, RS place primary emphasis on the quality of the Top-$K$ results rather than performance across the entire item set. However, estimating Top-$K$ accuracy (e.g., Precision@$K$, Recall@$K$) requires determining the ranking positions of items, which imposes substantial computational overhead and poses significant challenges for optimization. In addition, RS often suffer from distribution shifts due to evolving user preferences or data biases, further complicating the task.
  To address these issues, we propose Talos, a loss function that is specifically designed to optimize the Talos recommendation accuracy. Talos leverages a quantile technique that replaces the complex ranking-dependent operations into simpler comparisons between predicted scores and learned score thresholds. We further develop a sampling-based regression algorithm for efficient and accurate threshold estimation, and introduce a constraint term to maintain optimization stability by preventing score inflation. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored surrogate function to address discontinuity and enhance robustness against distribution shifts. Comprehensive theoretical analyzes and empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, convergence, and distributional robustness of Talos.

Conclusion: UniRec通过统一建模异构模态与嵌套结构，显著提升了LLM在多模态推荐中的表现，为复杂推荐信号建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models have recently shown promise for multimodal recommendation, particularly with text and image inputs. Yet real-world recommendation signals extend far beyond these modalities. To reflect this, we formalize recommendation features into four modalities: text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes, and highlight the unique challenges this heterogeneity poses for LLMs in understanding multimodal information. In particular, these challenges arise not only across modalities but also within them, as attributes such as price, rating, and time may all be numeric yet carry distinct semantic meanings. Beyond this intra-modality ambiguity, another major challenge is the nested structure of recommendation signals, where user histories are sequences of items, each associated with multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we propose UniRec, a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation. UniRec first employs modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across heterogeneous signals. It then adopts a triplet representation, comprising attribute name, type, and value, to separate schema from raw inputs and preserve semantic distinctions. Finally, a hierarchical Q-Former models the nested structure of user interactions while maintaining their layered organization. Across multiple real-world benchmarks, UniRec outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and LLM-based recommenders by up to 15%, and extensive ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component.

Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法直接沿用语言模型的自回归解码范式，存在难以建模全局依赖、忽略用户个性化属性关注顺序、推理效率低三大问题。

Method: 提出MDGR：(1)采用并行码本为扩散式生成提供结构基础；(2)训练中在时序和样本维度自适应构建掩码监督信号；(3)推理中设计基于预热的两阶段并行解码策略生成语义ID。

Result: 在多个公开及工业级数据集上超越10个SOTA基线方法，最高提升10.78%；在线广告平台部署后营收提升1.20%。

Conclusion: MDGR有效克服了自回归生成式推荐的关键局限，在推荐性能、推理效率和实际业务价值三方面均取得显著提升。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) typically first quantizes continuous item embeddings into multi-level semantic IDs (SIDs), and then generates the next item via autoregressive decoding. Although existing methods are already competitive in terms of recommendation performance, directly inheriting the autoregressive decoding paradigm from language models still suffers from three key limitations: (1) autoregressive decoding struggles to jointly capture global dependencies among the multi-dimensional features associated with different positions of SID; (2) using a unified, fixed decoding path for the same item implicitly assumes that all users attend to item attributes in the same order; (3) autoregressive decoding is inefficient at inference time and struggles to meet real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose MDGR, a Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation framework that reshapes the GR pipeline from three perspectives: codebook, training, and inference. (1) We adopt a parallel codebook to provide a structural foundation for diffusion-based GR. (2) During training, we adaptively construct masking supervision signals along both the temporal and sample dimensions. (3) During inference, we develop a warm-up-based two-stage parallel decoding strategy for efficient generation of SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and industrial-scale datasets show that MDGR outperforms ten state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.78%. Furthermore, by deploying MDGR on a large-scale online advertising platform, we achieve a 1.20% increase in revenue, demonstrating its practical value. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: In the era of explosive growth in academic literature, the burden of literature review on scholars are increasing. Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors. The proposed recommendation method was evaluated using the STM-KG dataset, a knowledge graph that incorporates scientific concepts derived from papers across ten distinct domains. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving an average precision of 27.3% among the top 50 recommendations. This represents an improvement of 6.7% over existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG依赖相关性检索，但相关性不等于效用（即是否真正提升下游任务生成质量）；现有效用驱动方法存在资源开销大、缺乏listwise排序损失两大缺陷。

Method: 提出LURE-RAG：在任意黑盒检索器后接入基于LambdaMART的轻量重排序器，使用LLM评估的效用信号构建listwise ranking loss进行端到端训练；同时设计其稠密变体UR-RAG。

Result: 在两个标准数据集上，LURE-RAG达到SOTA稠密模型97–98%的性能，训练与推理高效；UR-RAG超越最佳基线达3%。

Conclusion: 效用驱动的listwise重排序是提升RAG效果的关键路径，LURE-RAG以低开销实现了效用与排序质量的统一优化。

Abstract: Most conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on relevance-based retrieval, which often misaligns with utility -- that is, whether the retrieved passages actually improve the quality of the generated text specific to a downstream task such as question answering or query-based summarization. The limitations of existing utility-driven retrieval approaches for RAG are that, firstly, they are resource-intensive typically requiring query encoding, and that secondly, they do not involve listwise ranking loss during training. The latter limitation is particularly critical, as the relative order between documents directly affects generation in RAG. To address this gap, we propose Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking for Efficient RAG (LURE-RAG), a framework that augments any black-box retriever with an efficient LambdaMART-based reranker. Unlike prior methods, LURE-RAG trains the reranker with a listwise ranking loss guided by LLM utility, thereby directly optimizing the ordering of retrieved documents. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that LURE-RAG achieves competitive performance, reaching 97-98% of the state-of-the-art dense neural baseline, while remaining efficient in both training and inference. Moreover, its dense variant, UR-RAG, significantly outperforms the best existing baseline by up to 3%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升数据发现效率，尤其应对现实搜索行为中常见的拼写错误、模糊表达、地理上下文理解等关键词搜索难以处理的问题。

Method: 基于131个高频真实搜索词，对比UKRI语义搜索系统与CDRC关键词搜索系统；采用描述性统计、定性检验及定量指标（精确重叠率、Jaccard相似度、BERT嵌入余弦相似度）评估结果数量、重叠度、排序与相关性。

Result: 语义搜索返回结果数量更多，对地名、拼写错误、生僻/复杂查询表现突出；虽精确重叠率低，但余弦相似度高；排序策略与关键词搜索差异显著；案例显示其鲁棒性强、能有效解析地理与上下文信息、支持自然语言查询。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的语义搜索显著提升了数据发现能力，适合作为传统关键词搜索的互补工具，而非完全替代。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of a large language model (LLM) based semantic search tool relative to a traditional keyword-based search for data discovery. Using real-world search behaviour, we compare outputs from a bespoke semantic search system applied to UKRI data services with the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) keyword search. Analysis is based on 131 of the most frequently used search terms extracted from CDRC search logs between December 2023 and October 2024. We assess differences in the volume, overlap, ranking, and relevance of returned datasets using descriptive statistics, qualitative inspection, and quantitative similarity measures, including exact dataset overlap, Jaccard similarity, and cosine similarity derived from BERT embeddings. Results show that the semantic search consistently returns a larger number of results than the keyword search and performs particularly well for place based, misspelled, obscure, or complex queries. While the semantic search does not capture all keyword based results, the datasets returned are overwhelmingly semantically similar, with high cosine similarity scores despite lower exact overlap. Rankings of the most relevant results differ substantially between tools, reflecting contrasting prioritisation strategies. Case studies demonstrate that the LLM based tool is robust to spelling errors, interprets geographic and contextual relevance effectively, and supports natural-language queries that keyword search fails to resolve. Overall, the findings suggest that LLM driven semantic search offers a substantial improvement for data discovery, complementing rather than fully replacing traditional keyword-based approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLM）与强化学习（RL）的分层推荐框架LERL，旨在提升交互式推荐系统的长期用户满意度，缓解内容同质化与信息茧房问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式推荐系统易过拟合短期用户偏好，导致内容同质化和滤泡效应；当前多样性增强方法多为静态或单步设定，忽视用户兴趣的长期演化；强化学习虽适合建模长期满意度，但受限于稀疏长尾交互和语义规划能力不足。

Method: 提出LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning（LERL）：高层由LLM作为语义规划器，选择多样化的语义类别；底层由RL策略在选定语义空间内个性化推荐具体物品；通过分层设计缩小动作空间、提升规划效率并减少冗余内容曝光。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，LERL显著优于现有SOTA基线，有效提升长期用户满意度。

Conclusion: LERL成功融合LLM的语义理解与RL的序列决策能力，为动态、长期优化的推荐系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Interactive recommender systems can dynamically adapt to user feedback, but often suffer from content homogeneity and filter bubble effects due to overfitting short-term user preferences. While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space. This hierarchical design narrows the action space, enhances planning efficiency, and mitigates overexposure to redundant content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LERL significantly improves long-term user satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of LERL is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/code3-18D3/.

TL;DR: 本文提出DIGER方法，通过引入Gumbel噪声和不确定性衰减策略，实现语义ID的可微分学习，解决生成式推荐中索引与推荐目标不一致及码本坍塌问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法将语义ID（SID）视为预定义且静态索引，SID仅针对内容重建优化，导致索引目标与推荐目标不一致；同时，使索引可微分易引发码本坍塌。

Method: 提出DIGER框架：1）引入Gumbel噪声增强早期码本探索；2）设计两种不确定性衰减策略，平滑过渡从探索到利用；3）端到端联合优化语义索引与推荐目标。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上实验表明，DIGER显著提升推荐性能，验证了可微分语义ID在对齐索引与推荐目标上的有效性，并提升了码本利用率。

Conclusion: 可微分语义索引是生成式推荐的重要研究方向；DIGER为实现高效、稳定、端到端优化的语义ID学习提供了首个有效方案。

Abstract: Generative recommendation provides a novel paradigm in which each item is represented by a discrete semantic ID (SID) learned from rich content. Most existing methods treat SIDs as predefined and train recommenders under static indexing. In practice, SIDs are typically optimized only for content reconstruction rather than recommendation accuracy. This leads to an objective mismatch: the system optimizes an indexing loss to learn the SID and a recommendation loss for interaction prediction, but because the tokenizer is trained independently, the recommendation loss cannot update it. A natural approach is to make semantic indexing differentiable so that recommendation gradients can directly influence SID learning, but this often causes codebook collapse, where only a few codes are used. We attribute this issue to early deterministic assignments that limit codebook exploration, resulting in imbalance and unstable optimization.
  In this paper, we propose DIGER (Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation), a first step toward effective differentiable semantic IDs for generative recommendation. DIGER introduces Gumbel noise to explicitly encourage early-stage exploration over codes, mitigating codebook collapse and improving code utilization. To balance exploration and convergence, we further design two uncertainty decay strategies that gradually reduce the Gumbel noise, enabling a smooth transition from early exploration to exploitation of learned SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate consistent improvements from differentiable semantic IDs. These results confirm the effectiveness of aligning indexing and recommendation objectives through differentiable SIDs and highlight differentiable semantic indexing as a promising research direction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了生成式与智能体人工智能（AI）如何推动业务流程管理（BPM）从自动化迈向自主化，并提出基于过程挖掘的智能体业务流程管理系统（A-BPMS）架构，支持从人工驱动到完全自主的流程连续体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPM依赖设计驱动的自动化，而新一代生成式与智能体AI正推动其向数据驱动、自主决策的范式转变，需重新定义流程管理的边界与能力。

Method: 基于过程挖掘技术构建智能体业务流程管理系统（A-BPMS）架构，使系统具备感知流程状态、推理优化机会并自主执行的能力。

Result: 提出了A-BPMS的架构愿景，强调其需支持人类驱动至完全自主的流程连续体，并融合自主性、推理与学习能力。

Conclusion: Agentic AI将重塑BPM，使其从流程自动化升级为流程自治；A-BPMS是实现数据驱动、自适应、可持续优化的新一代流程管理平台。

Abstract: Since the early 90s, the evolution of the Business Process Management (BPM) discipline has been punctuated by successive waves of automation technologies. Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）在进化循环中生成具有明确高阶景观特性的连续黑箱优化问题的新方法，通过LLaMEA框架结合ELA预测器与多样性保持机制，成功扩展了BBOB基准库的结构多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续黑箱优化基准测试套件（如BBOB）结构多样性有限，难以全面评估优化算法性能。

Method: 基于LLaMEA框架，将大语言模型嵌入进化循环，根据自然语言描述（如多模态性、可分性等）生成问题代码；使用ELA-based属性预测器评分，并引入ELA空间中的适应度共享机制提升种群多样性；辅以吸引域分析、统计检验和可视化验证生成函数的特性。

Result: 生成的函数确实展现出目标景观特性，t-SNE嵌入表明其有效扩展了BBOB实例空间而非形成孤立簇；构建了一个广泛、可解释且可复现的新基准函数库。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的生成式基准构建范式可行且有效，为景观分析和自动算法选择等下游任务提供了高质量新基准。

Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.

Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地作为自主代理参与交互式和多智能体环境，理解其战略行为对安全性、协作性及AI驱动的社会经济系统至关重要。

Method: 采用收益缩放的重复囚徒困境实验，结合多模型、多语言对照；训练基于经典重复博弈策略的监督分类器，用于解析LLM决策背后的行为意图。

Result: 观察到一致的激励敏感型条件策略和跨语言行为差异；语言表述的影响有时等同甚至超过模型架构本身；LLM普遍存在合作偏差。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了评估LLM作为战略代理的统一审计框架，结果对AI治理与多智能体系统设计具有直接指导意义。

Abstract: As LLMs increasingly act as autonomous agents in interactive and multi-agent settings, understanding their strategic behavior is critical for safety, coordination, and AI-driven social and economic systems. We investigate how payoff magnitude and linguistic context shape LLM strategies in repeated social dilemmas, using a payoff-scaled Prisoner's Dilemma to isolate sensitivity to incentive strength. Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects. Our results provide a unified framework for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and highlight cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance and multi-agent system design.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种区间二型自适应神经模糊推理系统（IT2-ANFIS），用于污水处理厂能耗预测，不仅提供准确点预测，还通过三层不确定性分解（特征级、规则级、样本级）实现可解释的预测区间，提升风险感知决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 污水处理厂耗电量占全球1-3%，需精准能耗预测以优化运行与可持续性；现有机器学习模型缺乏可解释的不确定性量化能力，难以支持安全关键基础设施的风险感知决策。

Method: 构建区间二型自适应神经模糊推理系统（IT2-ANFIS），通过模糊规则结构生成可解释预测区间，并在特征级、规则级和实例级三个层面分解不确定性。

Result: 在墨尔本东部污水处理厂数据集上验证，IT2-ANFIS预测性能与一阶ANFIS相当，训练方差显著降低，并提供可解释的不确定性估计，将预测置信度直接关联至运行工况与输入变量。

Conclusion: IT2-ANFIS兼顾预测精度与不确定性可解释性，为能源密集型基础设施提供了面向风险决策的新型智能建模框架。

Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.

*Andrew Jaffe,Noah Reicin,Jinho D. Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了RIFT测试平台，通过重新排序指令来评估大语言模型（LLMs）在非线性提示结构下的指令遵循能力，发现当前模型高度依赖位置连续性，顺序错误和语义漂移导致约50%的失败，揭示了其在非顺序控制流任务中的根本局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准将任务复杂性与结构顺序混杂，难以分离提示拓扑结构对模型性能的独立影响；需专门评估LLM对指令顺序变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建RIFT（Reordered Instruction Following Testbed），使用改写后的Jeopardy!问答对，设计线性提示（顺序执行）与跳跃提示（内容相同但需非顺序遍历）两种结构，在6个开源SOTA LLM上开展10,000次评测。

Result: 跳跃提示下准确率最高下降72%；约50%错误源于指令顺序违反和语义漂移；模型表现出对位置连续性的强依赖。

Conclusion: 当前LLM将指令遵循内化为序列模式而非通用推理能力，结构敏感性是其根本局限，制约 workflow automation 和 multi-agent systems 等需非顺序控制流的应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for complex workflows, yet their ability to maintain flow of instructions remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出TS-Debate，一种面向时间序列分析的多模态、多智能体辩论框架，通过分工处理文本、视觉与数值信号，并引入验证-冲突-校准机制，在零样本设定下显著提升推理准确性与数值保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在时间序列分析中存在数值失真、模态干扰及跨模态融合缺乏原则性等问题。

Method: 设计TS-Debate框架：包含三类模态专用专家代理（文本、视觉、数值）、显式领域知识提取模块，以及由评审代理执行的结构化辩论协议；评审代理采用验证-冲突-校准机制，辅以轻量级代码执行和数值查表进行程序化验证。

Result: 在三个公开基准共20项任务上，TS-Debate在零样本设定下持续显著优于强基线（包括统一输入的多模态辩论方法）。

Conclusion: 模态专业化与结构化协作辩论可有效缓解LLM在时间序列推理中的数值幻觉与模态干扰问题，无需任务特定微调即可提升鲁棒性与准确性。

Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了NTP4VC，首个面向程序验证中验证条件（VC）自动证明的现实世界多语言基准，并基于Linux和Contiki-OS等真实项目构建；实验表明当前大语言模型在VC证明上虽有潜力，但仍有显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动定理证明器难以处理程序验证中实际产生的困难验证条件（VC），导致大量人工干预；神经定理证明（NTP）在数学竞赛中表现优异，但在VC证明这一关键任务上尚无专门基准与系统研究。

Method: 构建NTP4VC基准：利用Why3和Frama-C等工业工具链，从Linux、Contiki-OS等真实项目中提取VC，并生成跨Isabelle、Lean、Rocq三种形式语言的语义等价测试用例；评估通用及定理证明微调的大语言模型在该基准上的性能。

Result: 大语言模型在VC证明任务上展现出初步能力，但整体成功率仍低，暴露出其在逻辑严谨性、领域知识融合和复杂控制流建模等方面的明显不足。

Conclusion: NTP4VC填补了程序验证中VC自动证明缺乏现实基准的空白，实证揭示了当前LLM在该任务上的局限性与提升空间，为未来神经符号结合的验证方法研究提供了重要基础与方向。

Abstract: Theorem proving is fundamental to program verification, where the automated proof of Verification Conditions (VCs) remains a primary bottleneck. Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D情感说话人脸合成方法存在音频-视觉情绪对齐不佳（情绪提取难、微表情控制弱）和多视角融合策略未考虑特征质量与不确定性的问题。

Method: 提出三个核心模块：1）先验提取模块解耦音频为内容同步特征与个性化互补特征；2）情绪蒸馏模块采用多模态注意力加权融合与4D高斯编码实现细粒度情绪提取与微表情控制；3）基于不确定性的形变模块利用不确定性块估计输入噪声与模型参数不确定性，并结合多头解码器优化高斯基元以实现自适应多视角融合。

Result: 在常规与情感数据集上，UA-3DTalk在E-FID（情绪对齐）、SyncC（唇动同步）和LPIPS（渲染质量）指标上分别超越SOTA方法5.2%、3.1%和0.015。

Conclusion: UA-3DTalk通过引入不确定性建模与情绪先验蒸馏，显著提升了3D情感说话人脸合成中情绪对齐精度、唇动同步性与渲染质量。

Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

Motivation: 现有提升大语言模型函数调用能力的方法依赖人工标注或模型自动生成的数据进行微调，缺乏针对性设计，受限于固定模式和数据分布，难以提升泛化性与鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一种基于强化学习的对抗性数据增强框架，训练一个RL驱动的查询模型生成专门挑战函数调用模型的对抗性查询，二者以零和博弈方式交替迭代训练。

Result: 该方法能系统识别并修正大语言模型在工具交互能力上的弱点，显著提升函数调用模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本工作为构建更鲁棒的函数调用大语言模型提供了新范式，并为诊断和改进LLM工具调用能力提供了可扩展、系统化的解决方案。

Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTR模型在处理长度异质性用户行为序列时，单纯增加最大输入长度反而因注意力极化和训练数据长度不平衡而损害短序列用户性能。

Method: 提出LAIN（Length-Adaptive Interest Network）：包含谱长度编码器（将长度映射为连续表示）、长度条件提示（向长短行为分支注入全局上下文）、长度调制注意力（根据长度自适应调整注意力锐度）。

Result: 在三个真实数据集、五个强CTR基线上验证，LAIN平均提升AUC达1.15%，log loss降低2.25%，尤其显著提升短序列用户准确性，同时保持长序列性能。

Conclusion: LAIN是一种通用、高效、可部署的解决方案，能有效缓解序列推荐中的长度诱导偏差。

Abstract: User behavior sequences in modern recommendation systems exhibit significant length heterogeneity, ranging from sparse short-term interactions to rich long-term histories. While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness. Our work offers a general, efficient, and deployable solution to mitigate length-induced bias in sequential recommendation.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态记忆存储地理位置知识和推理模式，易产生事实幻觉且在开放世界或需动态知识的场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 提出LocationAgent，采用RER架构实现角色分离与上下文压缩以防止多步推理漂移；构建线索探索工具集用于地理证据验证；并发布面向中文城市的图像地理定位基准CCL-Bench。

Result: LocationAgent在零样本设置下相比现有方法性能提升至少30%。

Conclusion: 将推理逻辑内置于模型、验证过程外挂于工具的分层设计，能有效缓解事实幻觉与泛化瓶颈，提升图像地理定位的鲁棒性与实用性。

Abstract: Image geolocation aims to infer capture locations based on visual content. Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\% in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Automatically extracting workflows as procedural graphs from natural language is promising yet underexplored, demanding both structural validity and logical alignment. While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出CollectiveKV，一种跨用户KV共享机制，通过可学习的全局KV池捕获用户间共享信息，显著压缩KV缓存（降至原大小0.8%），同时保持或提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存虽能降低推理延迟，但在用户量大、历史序列长的推荐系统中带来巨大存储开销；作者发现不同用户的KV存在显著相似性，蕴含协同信号，且SVD分析表明KV信息主要可共享、仅少量用户特有。

Method: 提出CollectiveKV机制：构建可学习的全局KV池以建模跨用户共享信息；推理时，每个用户从池中检索高维共享KV，并与低维用户特有KV拼接形成最终KV。

Result: 在5种序列推荐模型和3个数据集上实验表明，该方法将KV缓存压缩至原始大小的0.8%，同时维持甚至提升模型性能。

Conclusion: CollectiveKV有效缓解了KV缓存的存储压力，验证了利用用户间KV协同性进行高效缓存压缩的可行性，为低延迟高扩展性序列推荐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出CoReTab框架，通过将多步推理与可执行Python代码结合，生成可扩展、可解释且可自动验证的标注，显著提升了多模态表格理解任务的性能和推理透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如MMTab）仅提供简短事实性答案，缺乏多步推理监督，导致模型回答准确率低、可解释性差。

Method: 提出CoReTab代码驱动推理框架，构建含115K样本的数据集（平均529词/响应），并采用三阶段流程微调开源多模态大语言模型。

Result: 在17个MMTab基准测试中，相比基线模型，在表格问答、事实验证和表格结构理解任务上分别提升+6.2%、+5.7%和+25.6%，同时生成可验证的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: CoReTab是一种鲁棒且通用的监督框架，有效提升了多模态表格理解中的多步推理能力。

Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动GUI智能体因UI外观和工作流频繁更新而性能下降，但其底层功能语义和任务意图具有稳定性，亟需利用这种稳定性提升适应性。

Method: 提出MAGNET框架，包含静态记忆（关联视觉特征与功能语义）和程序记忆（建模跨工作流的稳定任务意图），并设计动态记忆演化机制持续优化高频知识。

Result: 在AndroidWorld在线基准测试中显著优于基线，在离线基准中也展现出对分布偏移的鲁棒性与一致增益。

Conclusion: 利用界面演化中保持稳定的结构（功能语义与任务意图）可有效提升GUI智能体在动态软件环境中的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出MATA（多智能体分层可训练自动机），一种基于分层有限状态自动机的多智能体视觉推理框架，通过可训练的超智能体动态调度多个规则驱动的子智能体，并利用共享内存实现可解释、抗幻觉的推理过程；结合新构建的MATA-SFT-90K数据集进行监督微调，显著提升复杂视觉推理任务性能。

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型隐式推理难以解释且易产生幻觉；现有组合方法多依赖单智能体或手工流水线，缺乏对智能体间协作/竞争的自适应决策能力。

Method: 提出MATA框架：顶层为可训练超智能体（LLM）控制分层有限状态自动机的状态转移；每个状态对应一个规则驱动的小型子自动机（即专用智能体）；所有智能体共享内存以记录透明执行轨迹；构建transition-trajectory trees并转化为memory-to-next-state样本，形成MATA-SFT-90K数据集用于监督微调超智能体。

Conclusion: MATA通过分层多智能体架构与可学习调度机制，在保持推理可靠性的同时提升了复杂视觉语言任务的可解释性与性能，为可控、透明的视觉推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models have strong perceptual ability but their implicit reasoning is hard to explain and easily generates hallucinations on complex queries. Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/MATA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SpikeScore的新指标，用于检测大语言模型（LLM）生成内容中的幻觉现象，其核心思想是利用多轮对话中不确定性波动的突变特征来区分幻觉与事实性响应，并在跨领域场景下展现出优异的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法在同域数据上表现良好，但在跨领域场景下泛化能力差；本文关注一个被忽视但重要的问题——可泛化的幻觉检测（GHD），即仅用单领域数据训练检测器，却能在多个相关领域保持鲁棒性能。

Method: 基于观察到的‘幻觉引发的多轮对话具有更大不确定性波动’这一现象，提出SpikeScore指标，量化多轮对话中不确定性变化的突变程度，并结合理论分析与实证验证其跨领域判别能力。

Result: SpikeScore在多个LLM和基准测试上显著优于代表性基线方法，在跨领域泛化性能上超越了先进的泛化导向方法。

Conclusion: SpikeScore是一种简单有效、具有良好跨领域可泛化性的幻觉检测新范式，为提升LLM实际部署可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了GLOVE框架，通过主动探测记忆与新观察之间的一致性，实现无需真实标签监督或强模型内省的内存-环境再对齐，显著提升动态漂移环境下的智能体成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆的大语言模型方法通常依赖外部评估器或模型内部反思来验证记忆有效性，但在存在动态漂移的实际环境中这些假设往往失效。

Method: 提出全局验证器（GLOVE）框架，引入相对真理概念，通过主动探测检索记忆与新鲜观测之间的一致性，实现内存验证与更新。

Result: 在包含网页导航、规划和控制等多样化基准上，GLOVE在引入可控环境漂移的情况下显著提升了智能体成功率。

Conclusion: GLOVE为构建能在动态环境中自我演化的鲁棒认知智能体提供了一条新路径。

Abstract: Most existing memory-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) approaches implicitly assume that memory validity can be established either through external evaluators that provide task-specific success signals or through internal model cognition, such as reflection, for editing memory entries. However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动智能体在复杂应用中表现受限，主要由于知识不完整和对未见环境泛化能力弱。

Method: 将执行过程中的不确定性形式化为好奇心分数；当分数超过阈值时，从文档、代码库和历史轨迹中检索外部信息；将检索内容组织为结构化AppCards（含功能语义、参数约定、界面映射和交互模式）；增强型智能体在执行中选择性地将AppCards融入推理过程。

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准上平均提升6个百分点，结合GPT-5达到88.8%的新SOTA成功率；AppCards对多步与跨应用任务尤其有效；案例表明其可减少歧义、缩短探索、稳定执行轨迹。

Conclusion: 好奇心驱动的知识检索与结构化AppCards能有效缓解移动智能体的知识局限，提升规划可靠性与任务完成率。

Abstract: Mobile agents have made progress toward reliable smartphone automation, yet performance in complex applications remains limited by incomplete knowledge and weak generalization to unseen environments. We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model. Case studies further confirm that AppCards reduce ambiguity, shorten exploration, and support stable execution trajectories. Task trajectories are publicly available at https://lisalsj.github.io/Droidrun-appcard/.

Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.

Abstract: Modern AI systems increasingly comprise multiple interconnected neural networks to tackle complex inference tasks. Testing such systems for robustness and safety entails significant challenges. Current state-of-the-art robustness testing techniques, whether black-box or white-box, have been proposed and implemented for single-network models and do not scale well to multi-network pipelines. We propose a modular robustness testing framework that applies a given set of perturbations to test data. Our testing framework supports (1) a component-wise system analysis to isolate errors and (2) reasoning about error propagation across the neural network modules. The testing framework is architecture and modality agnostic and can be applied across domains. We apply the framework to a real-world autonomous rail inspection system composed of multiple deep networks and successfully demonstrate how our approach enables fine-grained robustness analysis beyond conventional end-to-end metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PROTEUS是一种新型LLM路由系统，支持以准确率目标τ为运行时输入，通过拉格朗日对偶控制实现精准、一致的精度保障，单模型覆盖0.85–0.95精度区间，显著优于基线（如OmniRouter），并在成本上大幅节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由器无法直接接受精度目标，参数调优间接、非单调且数据依赖，运维人员难以确保实际精度满足需求；需一种能直接响应精度SLO的动态路由机制。

Method: 提出PROTEUS路由器，采用拉格朗日对偶控制：用学习得到的对偶变量λ追踪约束违反，并作为策略网络的条件输入，使单个训练模型能根据运行时指定的精度目标τ自适应生成满足该目标的路由决策。

Result: 在RouterBench和SPROUT基准上，PROTEUS精度达标率（floor compliance）达100%，目标-响应相关性0.97–0.98；单模型覆盖τ∈[0.85,0.95]；精度分别达90.1%（距oracle差1.3%）和94.0%（距oracle差4.6%）；相较最优固定模型成本降低89.8%。

Conclusion: PROTEUS首次实现了LLM路由中精度SLO的直接、可靠、实时兑现，消除了离线调参与精度猜测，为多租户、差异化SLA的生产部署提供了新范式。

Abstract: Production LLM deployments serve diverse workloads where cost and quality requirements vary by customer tier, time of day, and query criticality. Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle. Cost savings reach 89.8% versus the best fixed model.

Motivation: 传统强化微调需生成完整推理路径，导致 rollout 阶段计算开销巨大。

Method: 提出RPO算法，利用经验缓存生成推理路径的后缀进行训练，避免全路径生成。

Result: RPO在1.5B模型上减少90%训练时间，在7B模型上减少72%；rollout阶段token生成减少约95%；可与GRPO、DAPO等算法兼容并加速其训练。

Conclusion: RPO是一种高效、即插即用的强化微调方法，显著降低计算成本而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.

### [277] [Benchmarks Saturate When The Model Gets Smarter Than The Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19532)
*Marthe Ballon,Andres Algaba,Brecht Verbeken,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Omni-MATH-2数据集，通过人工修订提升数学基准质量，并揭示了当前裁判模型（如Omni-Judge）在评估LLM时存在严重不可靠性，尤其在难题上易掩盖模型真实差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准（如Omni-MATH）存在数据不准确、评估方法有缺陷等问题，导致性能评估失真，亟需更干净的数据集和更可靠的评估机制。

Method: 人工审计并修订Omni-MATH数据集，构建含4181道精确答案题和247道标注非标准题的Omni-MATH-2；同时用GPT-5 mini与Omni-Judge对比，分析裁判间分歧及错误率，并结合专家标注验证裁判可靠性。

Result: Omni-MATH-2显著降低数据噪声；发现Omni-Judge在96.4%的裁判分歧中出错，无法区分模型能力；难题评估需更高能力裁判；现有裁判均未能识别标注子集中的模型失败模式。

Conclusion: 高质量数据集与高可靠性裁判缺一不可，二者共同决定LLM基准评估的准确性；未来基准建设须同步优化数据质量和裁判机制。

Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出FuseSearch，将并行代码定位重构为联合质量-效率优化任务，通过定义工具效率（唯一信息增益与调用次数之比），采用两阶段SFT和RL训练方法学习自适应并行策略，在SWE-bench Verified上实现SOTA性能并大幅降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码定位是自动化软件开发流程的关键瓶颈；当前并行工具执行存在34.9%冗余调用率，抵消了并行优势。

Method: 提出FuseSearch框架，定义‘工具效率’指标，采用两阶段监督微调（SFT）与强化学习（RL）训练，实现根据任务上下文动态调节搜索广度的自适应并行策略。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上，FuseSearch-4B达到84.7%文件级和56.4%函数级F1分数，提速93.6%，减少67.7%交互轮次和68.9% token消耗。

Conclusion: 效率感知训练不仅能显著提升运行效率，还能通过消除冗余噪声信号自然提升定位质量，从而构建高性能、低成本的代码定位智能体。

Abstract: Code localization constitutes a key bottleneck in automated software development pipelines. While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\% file-level and 56.4\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\% fewer turns and 68.9\% fewer tokens. Results indicate that efficiency-aware training naturally improves quality through eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance cost-effective localization agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出ComAgent，一种多LLM智能体框架，通过感知-规划-执行-反思闭环，自动将高层网络意图转化为可求解的数学模型和可复现仿真，显著提升6G跨层优化任务的自动化设计能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络依赖复杂的跨层优化，但人工将高层意图转化为数学公式仍是瓶颈；现有大模型方法缺乏领域深度、约束意识和验证能力。

Method: 提出ComAgent多LLM智能体框架，采用闭环的感知-规划-执行-反思流程，协调文献检索、代码生成与评分等专业化智能体，实现问题分解与自纠错。

Result: 在复杂波束成形优化等任务中达到专家级性能，且在多种无线通信任务中优于单体大模型。

Conclusion: ComAgent有效弥合用户意图与可执行方案之间的鸿沟，为新兴无线网络自动化设计提供新范式。

Abstract: Emerging 6G networks rely on complex cross-layer optimization, yet manually translating high-level intents into mathematical formulations remains a bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, monolithic approaches often lack sufficient domain grounding, constraint awareness, and verification capabilities. To address this, we present ComAgent, a multi-LLM agentic AI framework. ComAgent employs a closed-loop Perception-Planning-Action-Reflection cycle, coordinating specialized agents for literature search, coding, and scoring to autonomously generate solver-ready formulations and reproducible simulations. By iteratively decomposing problems and self-correcting errors, the framework effectively bridges the gap between user intent and execution. Evaluations demonstrate that ComAgent achieves expert-comparable performance in complex beamforming optimization and outperforms monolithic LLMs across diverse wireless tasks, highlighting its potential for automating design in emerging wireless networks.

Conclusion: 结合算法代码的上下文提示可有效提升大语言模型在启发式生成任务中的表现，为自动化搜索指导提供了可行且高效的新范式。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.

Conclusion: 该框架为智能体设计提供了统一语言和结构化方法，有助于提升智能体系统的模块性、可理解性与可靠性。

Abstract: With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则的激活安全新范式，将模型激活建模为细粒度、可解释的认知元素（CEs），并通过组合CEs上的谓词规则实现实时、可配置、可审计的安全监测，显著提升了精度与灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于激活的安全方法在精度、灵活性和可解释性方面存在不足，难以应对表面文本下隐藏的有害行为。

Method: 将激活建模为认知元素（CEs），设计可在CEs上定义和组合的谓词规则，并构建支持实时检测、无需重训练的实用框架。

Result: 所提方法在精度、领域定制能力和可解释性方面优于现有方法，并支持透明审计；将开源发布GAVEL框架及自动规则生成工具。

Conclusion: 规则化的激活安全范式为实现可扩展、可解释、可审计的AI治理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool.

TL;DR: CASTER是一种轻量级路由器，用于图结构多智能体系统中动态选择模型，通过结合语义嵌入与结构元特征评估任务难度，并利用自优化训练范式显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构多智能体系统虽支持复杂循环工作流，但静态模型分配效率低下——统一部署强模型会导致简单子任务浪费大量计算资源。

Method: 提出CASTER框架，包含双信号路由器（融合语义嵌入与结构元特征）和‘冷启动到迭代演化’的自优化训练范式，通过在线策略负反馈学习路由失败经验。

Result: 在软件工程、数据分析、科学发现和网络安全四大领域，CASTER相比强模型基线最多降低72.4%推理成本，同时保持同等成功率，并全面优于启发式路由与FrugalGPT。

Conclusion: CASTER实现了高效、自适应的动态模型路由，在保证性能前提下大幅节省计算开销，为图结构多智能体系统提供了实用可行的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable complex cyclic workflows but suffer from inefficient static model allocation, where deploying strong models uniformly wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks. We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.

Abstract: We address the task of routing natural language queries in multi-database enterprise environments. We construct realistic benchmarks by extending existing NL-to-SQL datasets. Our study shows that routing becomes increasingly challenging with larger, domain-overlapping DB repositories and ambiguous queries, motivating the need for more structured and robust reasoning-based solutions. By explicitly modelling schema coverage, structural connectivity, and fine-grained semantic alignment, the proposed modular, reasoning-driven reranking strategy consistently outperforms embedding-only and direct LLM-prompting baselines across all the metrics.

Result: 实验证明，图文交替的思维链推理在依赖视觉世界建模的任务上显著优于纯语言推理，而在其他任务中无明显优势；验证了视觉生成作为世界模型在物理世界任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态世界建模（尤其视觉生成）是提升AI物理与空间推理能力、实现更类人推理的关键路径；该工作为多模态AI的推理架构设计提供了理论依据与实证支持。

Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于真实轨迹数据的多目标学习框架，通过帕累托前沿分析自动驾驶车辆在安全性、效率与交互性三者间的权衡关系，并在TGSIM数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平衡安全性、效率和交互性是自动驾驶系统设计与行为理解的核心挑战，现有方法缺乏从真实驾驶数据中直接推导这些权衡的经验基础。

Method: 构建统一的目标空间，将每个自动驾驶时间步表示为安全、效率和交互的复合得分；采用帕累托优势识别非支配状态，形成经验前沿；使用Foggy Bottom和I-395的TGSIM数据集进行验证。

Result: 仅0.23%的自动驾驶实例达到帕累托最优；帕累托最优状态在三项目标上平均得分均更高，其中交互性提升潜力最大；该框架仅需运动学与位置数据，具备模块化与低侵入性。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动驾驶多目标优化提供了可解释、可推广的经验基准，支持可视化多目标学习曲面，适用于更广泛的AV评估与学习任务。

Abstract: Balancing safety, efficiency, and interaction is fundamental to designing autonomous driving agents and to understanding autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior in real-world operation. This study introduces an empirical learning framework that derives these trade-offs directly from naturalistic trajectory data. A unified objective space represents each AV timestep through composite scores of safety, efficiency, and interaction. Pareto dominance is applied to identify non-dominated states, forming an empirical frontier that defines the attainable region of balanced performance.
  The proposed framework was demonstrated using the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) datasets from Foggy Bottom and I-395. Results showed that only 0.23\% of AV driving instances were Pareto-optimal, underscoring the rarity of simultaneous optimization across objectives. Pareto-optimal states showed notably higher mean scores for safety, efficiency, and interaction compared to non-optimal cases, with interaction showing the greatest potential for improvement.
  This minimally invasive and modular framework, which requires only kinematic and positional data, can be directly applied beyond the scope of this study to derive and visualize multi-objective learning surfaces

Conclusion: DeFM填补了深度模态基础模型的空白，为机器人领域提供了首个面向深度图像的大规模自监督基础模型，显著提升了深度表征学习能力与跨场景泛化性。

Abstract: Depth sensors are widely deployed across robotic platforms, and advances in fast, high-fidelity depth simulation have enabled robotic policies trained on depth observations to achieve robust sim-to-real transfer for a wide range of tasks. Despite this, representation learning for depth modality remains underexplored compared to RGB, where large-scale foundation models now define the state of the art. To address this gap, we present DeFM, a self-supervised foundation model trained entirely on depth images for robotic applications. Using a DINO-style self-distillation objective on a curated dataset of 60M depth images, DeFM learns geometric and semantic representations that generalize to diverse environments, tasks, and sensors. To retain metric awareness across multiple scales, we introduce a novel input normalization strategy. We further distill DeFM into compact models suitable for resource-constrained robotic systems. When evaluated on depth-based classification, segmentation, navigation, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks, DeFM achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization from simulation to real-world environments. We release all our pretrained models, which can be adopted off-the-shelf for depth-based robotic learning without task-specific fine-tuning. Webpage: https://de-fm.github.io/

Abstract: Recent advances in learned control, large-scale simulation, and generative models have accelerated progress toward general-purpose robotic controllers, yet the field still lacks platforms suitable for safe, expressive, long-term deployment in human environments. Most existing humanoids are either closed industrial systems or academic prototypes that are difficult to deploy and operate around people, limiting progress in robotics. We introduce Sprout, a developer platform designed to address these limitations through an emphasis on safety, expressivity, and developer accessibility. Sprout adopts a lightweight form factor with compliant control, limited joint torques, and soft exteriors to support safe operation in shared human spaces. The platform integrates whole-body control, manipulation with integrated grippers, and virtual-reality-based teleoperation within a unified hardware-software stack. An expressive head further enables social interaction -- a domain that remains underexplored on most utilitarian humanoids. By lowering physical and technical barriers to deployment, Sprout expands access to capable humanoid platforms and provides a practical basis for developing embodied intelligence in real human environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种切换式非线性模型预测控制（NMPC）策略，用于水下运载器-机械臂系统（UVMS）在无法避障时，主动利用机械臂推抵障碍物实现安全脱险。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下自主作业中，水下运载器-机械臂系统（UVMS）易遭遇突发障碍碰撞，亟需一种既能主动避障、又能在不可避免碰撞时安全应对的控制策略。

Method: 提出一种切换式非线性模型预测控制（NMPC）策略：在检测到潜在碰撞时，根据是否可避障动态切换控制目标——优先避障；若避障不可行，则激活机械臂与障碍物接触并施力以实现受控偏转。

Result: 通过虚拟仿真实验验证了该算法能可靠检测碰撞风险，并在避障失败时利用机械臂安全推离障碍物，避免对运载器敏感部位造成损伤。

Conclusion: 切换式NMPC策略为UVMS提供了兼具避障能力与碰撞主动处置能力的安全控制框架，拓展了其在复杂未知水下环境中的作业鲁棒性与适应性。

Abstract: For active intervention tasks in underwater environments, the use of autonomous vehicles is just now emerging as an active area of research. During operation, for various reasons, the robot might find itself on a collision course with an obstacle in its environment. In this paper, a switching Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy is proposed to safely handle collisions for an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS). When avoiding the collision is impossible, the control algorithm takes advantage of the manipulator, using it to push against the obstacle, and deflect away from the collision. Virtual experiments are performed to demonstrate the algorithm's capability to successfully detect collisions and either avoid them, or use the manipulator to handle them appropriately without damaging sensitive areas of the vehicle.

Abstract: Conventional robotic Braille readers typically rely on discrete, character-by-character scanning, limiting reading speed and disrupting natural flow. Vision-based alternatives often require substantial computation, introduce latency, and degrade in real-world conditions. In this work, we present a high accuracy, real-time pipeline for continuous Braille recognition using Evetac, an open-source neuromorphic event-based tactile sensor. Unlike frame-based vision systems, the neuromorphic tactile modality directly encodes dynamic contact events during continuous sliding, closely emulating human finger-scanning strategies. Our approach combines spatiotemporal segmentation with a lightweight ResNet-based classifier to process sparse event streams, enabling robust character recognition across varying indentation depths and scanning speeds. The proposed system achieves near-perfect accuracy (>=98%) at standard depths, generalizes across multiple Braille board layouts, and maintains strong performance under fast scanning. On a physical Braille board containing daily-living vocabulary, the system attains over 90% word-level accuracy, demonstrating robustness to temporal compression effects that challenge conventional methods. These results position neuromorphic tactile sensing as a scalable, low latency solution for robotic Braille reading, with broader implications for tactile perception in assistive and robotic applications.

*Kurt Enkera,Josh Pinskier,Marcus Gallagher,David Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出SimTO框架，通过物理仿真自动提取接触载荷，实现软体抓手的高分辨率拓扑优化，使其能安全、精准地抓取具有复杂几何与拓扑特征的物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软体抓手难以安全、有效抓取具有高拓扑变异性与丰富几何特征的物体（如齿轮、珊瑚、西兰花），因其缺乏明确最优接触面且易造成损伤；传统拓扑优化需预设载荷，而实际抓取中接触力数量多、不可预知。

Method: 提出SimTO框架：结合接触感知物理仿真器自动提取真实抓取过程中的多点接触载荷，并以此驱动高分辨率拓扑优化，生成形态高度定制化的软体抓手设计。

Result: 生成的抓手在数值实验中展现出对目标特征物体的高度特异性，同时具备对未见过的同类物体的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: SimTO突破了传统拓扑优化对先验载荷的依赖，为面向复杂真实物体的软体机器人定制化设计提供了可扩展、自动化的新范式。

Abstract: Soft robotic grippers are essential for grasping delicate, geometrically complex objects in manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. However, existing grippers struggle to grasp feature-rich objects with high topological variability, including gears with sharp tooth profiles on automotive assembly lines, corals with fragile protrusions, or vegetables with irregular branching structures like broccoli. Unlike simple geometric primitives such as cubes or spheres, feature-rich objects lack a clear "optimal" contact surface, making them both difficult to grasp and susceptible to damage when grasped by existing gripper designs. Safe handling of such objects therefore requires specialized soft grippers whose morphology is tailored to the object's features. Topology optimization offers a promising approach for producing specialized grippers, but its utility is limited by the requirement for pre-defined load cases. For soft grippers interacting with feature-rich objects, these loads arise from hundreds of unpredictable gripper-object contact forces during grasping and are unknown a priori. To address this problem, we introduce SimTO, a framework that enables high-resolution topology optimization by automatically extracting load cases from a contact-based physics simulator, eliminating the need for manual load specification. Given an arbitrary feature-rich object, SimTO produces highly customized soft grippers with fine-grained morphological features tailored to the object geometry. Numerical results show our designs are not only highly specialized to feature-rich objects, but also generalize to unseen objects.

*Peter Travis Jardine,Sidney Givigi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的分布式编队控制方法，通过引入可协商的局部约束势函数，在无需全局信息和智能体间通信的前提下，实现异构、部分可信多智能体系统的鲁棒协同运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编队控制假设所有智能体具有统一且一致的期望间距，难以适应实际中日益增长的异构性与目标冲突场景；同时，智能体常面临通信不安全或信任缺失的问题。

Method: 提出一种新型约束集体势函数，允许各智能体基于局部观测自主协商个体间距离与约束参数，完全避免全局信息依赖和显式通信。

Result: 在多种仿真场景下验证了该方法的有效性，尤其在半可信（即邻近智能体目标部分冲突）环境下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法拓展了经典编队理论，为开放、异构、低信任度的多智能体系统提供了实用且可扩展的协同控制框架。

Abstract: Robots sometimes have to work together with a mixture of partially-aligned or conflicting goals. Flocking - coordinated motion through cohesion, alignment, and separation - traditionally assumes uniform desired inter-agent distances. Many practical applications demand greater flexibility, as the diversity of types and configurations grows with the popularity of multi-agent systems in society. Moreover, agents often operate without guarantees of trust or secure communication. Motivated by these challenges we update well-established frameworks by relaxing this assumption of shared inter-agent distances and constraints. Through a new form of constrained collective potential function, we introduce a solution that permits negotiation of these parameters. In the spirit of the traditional flocking control canon, this negotiation is achieved purely through local observations and does not require any global information or inter-agent communication. The approach is robust to semi-trust scenarios, where neighbouring agents pursue conflicting goals. We validate the effectiveness of the approach through a series of simulations.

Conclusion: 该框架在可控扰动下实现高效鲁棒仓储，显著降低重定位需求，提升了自动化仓储系统在动态环境中的实用性与可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for improving the operational efficiency of automated storage systems under uncertainty. It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $Θ(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\%+$.

Abstract: Tactile memory, the ability to store and retrieve touch-based experience, is critical for contact-rich tasks such as key insertion under uncertainty. To replicate this capability, we introduce Tactile Memory with Soft Robot (TaMeSo-bot), a system that integrates a soft wrist with tactile retrieval-based control to enable safe and robust manipulation. The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation. We validate our approach on peg-in-hole tasks with diverse pegs and conditions in real-robot experiments. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that MAT$^\text{3}$ achieves higher success rates than the baselines over all conditions and shows remarkable capability to adapt to unseen pegs and conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Perception-to-Pursuit（P2P）的跟踪中心化时序推理框架，用于自主无人机追击任务，兼顾轨迹预测精度与拦截可行性，在真实数据集上显著提升了预测准确率和拦截成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪方法仅优化预测精度，忽视了追击动作的运动学可行性，导致99.9%的预测轨迹无法实际拦截。

Method: 提出P2P框架，将无人机运动表示为8维紧凑token（含速度、加速度、尺度和光滑性），并采用12帧因果Transformer进行未来行为推理；引入拦截成功率（ISR）作为衡量追击可行性的新指标。

Result: 在Anti-UAV-RGBT数据集（226个真实无人机序列）上，平均位移误差为28.12像素，ISR达0.597，相比纯跟踪基线，轨迹预测提升77%，追击可行性提升597倍，且无人机分类准确率达100%。

Conclusion: 基于运动模式的时序推理可同时实现高精度轨迹预测与可执行的追击规划，为自主追击系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Autonomous drone pursuit requires not only detecting drones but also predicting their trajectories in a manner that enables kinematically feasible interception. Existing tracking methods optimize for prediction accuracy but ignore pursuit feasibility, resulting in trajectories that are physically impossible to intercept 99.9% of the time. We propose Perception-to-Pursuit (P2P), a track-centric temporal reasoning framework that bridges detection and actionable pursuit planning. Our method represents drone motion as compact 8-dimensional tokens capturing velocity, acceleration, scale, and smoothness, enabling a 12-frame causal transformer to reason about future behavior. We introduce the Intercept Success Rate (ISR) metric to measure pursuit feasibility under realistic interceptor constraints. Evaluated on the Anti-UAV-RGBT dataset with 226 real drone sequences, P2P achieves 28.12 pixel average displacement error and 0.597 ISR, representing a 77% improvement in trajectory prediction and 597x improvement in pursuit feasibility over tracking-only baselines, while maintaining perfect drone classification accuracy (100%). Our work demonstrates that temporal reasoning over motion patterns enables both accurate prediction and actionable pursuit planning.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning agents for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments faces critical challenges regarding safety, data scarcity, and limited computational resources. Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

Motivation: 学习型MAPF求解器虽快速可扩展，但常产生含不必要或振荡运动的可行轨迹，影响实际部署效果。

Method: 提出Judgelight方法，将轨迹中冗余闭合子路径压缩，形式化为MAPF-Collapse问题，并证明其NP-hard；采用整数线性规划（ILP）进行精确优化。

Result: 实验表明Judgelight可将解成本平均降低约20%，尤其对学习型求解器效果显著，生成更适用于真实场景的轨迹。

Conclusion: Judgelight是一种有效提升MAPF解质量的后优化技术，兼顾可行性与实用性，为学习型求解器的实际应用提供了重要补充。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is an NP-hard problem with applications in warehouse automation and multi-robot coordination. Learning-based MAPF solvers offer fast and scalable planning but often produce feasible trajectories that contain unnecessary or oscillatory movements. We propose Judgelight, a post-optimization method that improves trajectory quality after a MAPF solver generates a feasible schedule. Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experimental results show Judgelight consistently reduces solution cost by around 20%, particularly for learning-based solvers, producing trajectories that are better suited for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Synthetic simulation data and real-world human data provide scalable alternatives to circumvent the prohibitive costs of robot data collection. However, these sources suffer from the sim-to-real visual gap and the human-to-robot embodiment gap, respectively, which limits the policy's generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we identify a natural yet underexplored complementarity between these sources: simulation offers the robot action that human data lacks, while human data provides the real-world observation that simulation struggles to render. Motivated by this insight, we present SimHum, a co-training framework to simultaneously extract kinematic prior from simulated robot actions and visual prior from real-world human observations. Based on the two complementary priors, we achieve data-efficient and generalizable robotic manipulation in real-world tasks. Empirically, SimHum outperforms the baseline by up to $\mathbf{40\%}$ under the same data collection budget, and achieves a $\mathbf{62.5\%}$ OOD success with only 80 real data, outperforming the real only baseline by $7.1\times$.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为任务中心运动先验（TCMP）的新框架，用于解决人形机器人控制中运动模仿与任务优化之间的冲突，通过将模仿作为条件正则化项而非平等目标，实现自然行为与高效任务执行的统一。


<details>

Motivation: 人类演示常因机器人本体差异、重定向误差和任务无关变化而次优或不匹配，导致直接模仿损害任务性能；而纯任务强化学习又易产生不自然或不稳定动作。线性奖励混合在对抗式模仿学习中存在根本局限。

Result: 实验表明TCMP在噪声演示下仍能保持鲁棒的任务性能和一致的运动风格。

Conclusion: TCMP有效缓解了模仿学习与任务优化之间的矛盾，实现了几何感知、任务可行且抗干扰的策略更新。

Abstract: Humanoid control often leverages motion priors from human demonstrations to encourage natural behaviors. However, such demonstrations are frequently suboptimal or misaligned with robotic tasks due to embodiment differences, retargeting errors, and task-irrelevant variations, causing naïve imitation to degrade task performance. Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment. We provide theoretical analysis of gradient conflict and task-priority stationary points, and validate our claims through humanoid control experiments demonstrating robust task performance with consistent motion style under noisy demonstrations.

Abstract: For lattice modular self-reconfigurable robots (MSRRs), maintaining stable connections during reconfiguration is crucial for physical feasibility and deployability. This letter presents a novel self-reconfiguration planning algorithm for deformable quadrilateral MSRRs that guarantees stable connection. The method first constructs feasible connect/disconnect actions using a virtual graph representation, and then organizes these actions into a valid execution sequence through a Dependence-based Reverse Tree (DRTree) that resolves interdependencies. We also prove that reconfiguration sequences satisfying motion characteristics exist for any pair of configurations with seven or more modules (excluding linear topologies). Finally, comparisons with a modified BiRRT algorithm highlight the superior efficiency and stability of our approach, while deployment on a physical robotic platform confirms its practical feasibility.

Conclusion: 该框架兼顾形式化保证与实际部署需求，适用于复杂动态环境下的实时机器人控制。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can be highly effective at learning goal-reaching policies, but it typically does not provide formal guarantees that the goal will always be reached. A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种考虑姿态误差的DVL速度变换模型和基于协方差传播的不确定性建模方法，显著提升了水下SINS/DVL组合导航的长期精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SINS/DVL松耦合系统中，由SINS姿态误差引起的DVL速度投影偏差会随时间累积，导致导航性能下降。

Method: 1）构建姿态误差感知的DVL速度变换模型，在观测方程中引入姿态误差项；2）提出基于协方差矩阵的方差传播方法，实现DVL测量不确定性在坐标系间的准确转换，并加入期望姿态误差补偿项。

Result: 仿真与实验证明：两种改进各自提升导航精度；联合使用可有效抑制长期误差发散；实测3D位置RMSE提升78.3%，最大分量位置误差降低71.8%。

Conclusion: 所提方法能显著改善SINS/DVL系统在长时间运行下的导航鲁棒性与精度。

Abstract: In underwater navigation systems, strap-down inertial navigation system/Doppler velocity log (SINS/DVL)-based loosely coupled architectures are widely adopted. Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型或强化学习的社交机器人个性化方法难以全面捕捉长期、短期和细粒度的用户偏好，且无法有效支撑动作排序、主动个性化与伦理自适应。

Method: 通过范式对齐、识别关键推荐技术，并将其设计为模块化、可插拔组件，系统性地将推荐系统方法融入社交机器人全栈流程。

Result: 建立了首个将推荐系统技术深度集成到社交机器人中的框架，明确了跨领域协作的关键路径。

Conclusion: 推荐系统是提升社交机器人个性化能力的有效新范式，其与HRI的融合有望加速两领域协同创新。

Abstract: Personalization in social robots refers to the ability of the robot to meet the needs and/or preferences of an individual user. Existing approaches typically rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses based on user metadata and historical interactions or on adaptive methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) to learn from users' immediate reactions in real time. However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. To ensure the integration of RS techniques is well-grounded and seamless throughout the social robot pipeline, we (i) align the paradigms underlying social robots and RSs, (ii) identify key techniques that can enhance personalization in social robots, and (iii) design them as modular, plug-and-play components. This work not only establishes a framework for integrating RS techniques into social robots but also opens a pathway for deep collaboration between the RS and HRI communities, accelerating innovation in both fields.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在机器人控制中缺乏模块化、闭环的智能体执行机制，且操纵任务基准未系统评估多步推理和语言变化。

Method: 提出Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation（ALRM）框架，包含Code-as-Policy（CaP）和Tool-as-Policy（TaP）两种模式，基于ReAct风格推理循环实现策略生成与智能体执行；并构建含56个任务、多环境、语言多样性的新仿真基准。

Result: 在十种LLM上的实验表明ALRM具有可扩展性、可解释性和模块性；Claude-4.1-Opus（闭源）和Falcon-H1-7B（开源）分别在CaP模式下表现最优。

Conclusion: ALRM有效弥合了自然语言推理与可靠机器人执行之间的鸿沟，为LLM驱动的机器人操作提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently empowered agentic frameworks to exhibit advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution. Results reveal Claude-4.1-Opus as the top closed-source model and Falcon-H1-7B as the top open-source model under CaP.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PALM是一种用于图像行为克隆的泛化方法，通过局部动作分布不变性同时应对工作空间偏移、视角变化和跨形态迁移，无需额外模态、模型修改或数据收集，在仿真和真实世界中显著降低OOD性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅单独解决图像行为克隆中的某类分布外（OOD）泛化问题（如工作空间偏移、视角变化、跨形态迁移），且依赖复杂流程，缺乏统一、轻量的解决方案。

Method: PALM将操纵策略模块化为粗粒度全局组件与细粒度局部策略；在局部策略层面，通过强制局部视觉聚焦和一致的本体感受表征，减小域内与OOD输入间的表征差异，从而利用局部动作分布的不变性实现泛化。

Result: 实验表明，PALM在仿真环境中OOD性能下降仅8%（基线为45%），真实世界中下降24%（基线为77%）。

Conclusion: PALM提供了一种简洁、模块化且无需额外资源的方法，能同时应对多种OOD挑战，显著提升图像行为克隆的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizing beyond the training domain in image-based behavior cloning remains challenging. Existing methods address individual axes of generalization, workspace shifts, viewpoint changes, and cross-embodiment transfer, yet they are typically developed in isolation and often rely on complex pipelines. We introduce PALM (Perception Alignment for Local Manipulation), which leverages the invariance of local action distributions between out-of-distribution (OOD) and demonstrated domains to address these OOD shifts concurrently, without additional input modalities, model changes, or data collection. PALM modularizes the manipulation policy into coarse global components and a local policy for fine-grained actions. We reduce the discrepancy between in-domain and OOD inputs at the local policy level by enforcing local visual focus and consistent proprioceptive representation, allowing the policy to retrieve invariant local actions under OOD conditions. Experiments show that PALM limits OOD performance drops to 8% in simulation and 24% in the real world, compared to 45% and 77% for baselines.

Conclusion: Rhombot以极简驱动和新颖运动原语实现了可靠、介质无关的自重构，为轻量、鲁棒的MSRR系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Rhombot, a novel deformable planar lattice modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSRR) with a rhombus shaped module. Each module consists of a parallelogram skeleton with a single centrally mounted actuator that enables folding and unfolding along its diagonal. The core design philosophy is to achieve essential MSRR functionalities such as morphing, docking, and locomotion with minimal control complexity. This enables a continuous and stable reconfiguration process that is independent of the surrounding medium, allowing the system to reliably form various configurations in diverse environments. To leverage the unique kinematics of Rhombot, we introduce morphpivoting, a novel motion primitive for reconfiguration that differs from advanced MSRR systems, and propose a strategy for its continuous execution. Finally, a series of physical experiments validate the module's stable reconfiguration ability, as well as its positional and docking accuracy.

Motivation: 解决传统逆透视映射（IPM）在道路制图中因共面假设导致的映射误差大、单应矩阵和车辆位姿估计不准等问题，同时追求低成本、高精度、通用性强的向量化道路地图生成方案。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了低成本、高精度、泛化性强的向量化道路制图，提升了IPM在真实道路场景中的适用性与鲁棒性，为高精地图自动化构建提供了实用新路径。

Abstract: In this study, we present a low-cost and unified framework for vectorized road mapping leveraging enhanced inverse perspective mapping (IPM). In this framework, Catmull-Rom splines are utilized to characterize lane lines, and all the other ground markings are depicted using polygons uniformly. The results from instance segmentation serve as references to refine the three-dimensional position of spline control points and polygon corner points. In conjunction with this process, the homography matrix of IPM and vehicle poses are optimized simultaneously. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the mapping errors associated with IPM. It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM. These enhancements enable IPM to be effectively applied to vectorized road mapping, which serves a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy. In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines. The proposed framework is evaluated in two different practical scenarios, and the test results show that our method can automatically generate high-precision maps with near-centimeter-level accuracy. Importantly, the optimized IPM matrix achieves an accuracy comparable to that of manual calibration, while the accuracy of vehicle poses is also significantly improved.

Conclusion: 动作上下文是提升VLA模型推理效率的关键，AC^2-VLA提供了一种统一、可迁移的自适应计算范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance in robotic manipulation, yet their closed-loop deployment is hindered by the high latency and compute cost of repeatedly running large vision-language backbones at every timestep. We observe that VLA inference exhibits structured redundancies across temporal, spatial, and depth dimensions, and that most existing efficiency methods ignore action context, despite its central role in embodied tasks. To address this gap, we propose Action-Context-aware Adaptive Computation for VLA models (AC^2-VLA), a unified framework that conditions computation on current visual observations, language instructions, and previous action states. Based on this action-centric context, AC^2-VLA adaptively performs cognition reuse across timesteps, token pruning, and selective execution of model components within a unified mechanism. To train the adaptive policy, we introduce an action-guided self-distillation scheme that preserves the behavior of the dense VLA policy while enabling structured sparsification that transfers across tasks and settings. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that AC^2-VLA achieves up to a 1.79\times speedup while reducing FLOPs to 29.4% of the dense baseline, with comparable task success.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly integrated into daily life, understanding responses to robot mistreatment carries important ethical and design implications. This mixed-methods study (N = 201) examined how anthropomorphic levels and moral foundations shape reactions to robot abuse. Participants viewed videos depicting physical mistreatment of robots varying in humanness (Spider, Twofoot, Humanoid) and completed measures assessing moral foundations, anger, and social distance. Results revealed that anthropomorphism determines whether people extend moral consideration to robots, while moral foundations shape how they reason about such consideration. Qualitative analysis revealed distinct reasoning patterns: low-progressivism individuals employed character-based judgments, while high-progressivism individuals engaged in future-oriented moral deliberation. Findings offer implications for robot design and policy communication.

Abstract: Programming by demonstration is a strategy to simplify the robot programming process for non-experts via human demonstrations. However, its adoption for bimanual tasks is an underexplored problem due to the complexity of hand coordination, which also hinders data recording. This paper presents a novel one-shot method for processing a single RGB video of a bimanual task demonstration to generate an execution plan for a dual-arm robotic system. To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination. We validated the effectiveness of this framework through multiple subject video demonstrations, which we collected and made open-source, and exploiting data from an external, publicly available dataset. Comparisons with existing methods revealed significant improvements in generating a centralized execution plan for coordinating two-arm systems.

Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.

These findings underscore the effectiveness of data-driven methods in assessing trust within human-robot collaboration, emphasizing the valuable role behavioral indicators play in predicting the dynamics of human trust.
