We present ShelfAware, a semantic particle filter for robust global localization that treats scene semantics as statistical evidence over object categories rather than fixed landmarks. ShelfAware fuses a depth likelihood with a category-centric semantic similarity and uses a precomputed bank of semantic viewpoints to perform inverse semantic proposals inside MCL, yielding fast, targeted hypothesis generation on low-cost, vision-only hardware. Across 100 global-localization trials spanning four conditions (cart-mounted, wearable, dynamic obstacles, and sparse semantics) in a semantically dense, retail environment, ShelfAware achieves a 96% success rate (vs. 22% MCL and 10% AMCL) with a mean time-to-convergence of 1.91s, attains the lowest translational RMSE in all conditions, and maintains stable tracking in 80% of tested sequences, all while running in real time on a consumer laptop-class platform.

SuperFrustum is an analytical primitive that is simultaneously (1) expressive, being able to model various common solids such as cylinders, spheres, cones & their tapered and bent forms, (2) editable, being compactly parameterized with 8 parameters, and (3) optimizable, with a sign distance field differentiable w.r.t. its parameters almost everywhere. ResFit is an unsupervised procedure that interleaves global shape analysis with local optimization, iteratively fitting primitives to the unexplained residual of a shape to discover a parsimonious yet accurate decompositions for each input shape.

Yet most evaluations reduce deception to static classification, ignoring the interactive, adversarial, and longitudinal nature of real deceptive dynamics. Large language models (LLMs) can deceive convincingly but remain weak at detecting deception in peers. We present WOLF, a multi-agent social deduction benchmark based on Werewolf that enables separable measurement of deception production and detection. WOLF embeds role-grounded agents (Villager, Werewolf, Seer, Doctor) in a programmable LangGraph state machine with strict night-day cycles, debate turns, and majority voting. Every statement is a distinct analysis unit, with self-assessed honesty from speakers and peer-rated deceptiveness from others. Deception is categorized via a standardized taxonomy (omission, distortion, fabrication, misdirection), while suspicion scores are longitudinally smoothed to capture both immediate judgments and evolving trust dynamics. Structured logs preserve prompts, outputs, and state transitions for full reproducibility. Across 7,320 statements and 100 runs, Werewolves produce deceptive statements in 31% of turns, while peer detection achieves 71-73% precision with ~52% overall accuracy. Precision is higher for identifying Werewolves, though false positives occur against Villagers.

It is well established that performance factors such as the robot's competence and its reliability shape cognitive trust. Recent studies suggest that affective factors, such as robotic attentiveness, also play a role in building cognitive trust. This work explores the interplay between these two factors that shape cognitive trust. Specifically, we evaluated whether different combinations of robotic competence and attentiveness introduce a compensatory mechanism, where one factor compensates for the lack of the other. In the experiment, participants performed a search task with a robotic dog in a 2x2 experimental design that included two factors: competence (high or low) and attentiveness (high or low). The results revealed that high attentiveness can compensate for low competence. Participants who collaborated with a highly attentive robot that performed poorly reported trust levels comparable to those working with a highly competent robot. When the robot did not demonstrate attentiveness, low competence resulted in a substantial decrease in cognitive trust. The findings indicate that building cognitive trust in human-robot interaction may be more complex than previously believed, involving emotional processes that are typically overlooked. We highlight an affective compensatory mechanism that adds a layer to consider alongside traditional competence-based models of cognitive trust.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\uff08competence\uff09\u4e0e\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\uff08attentiveness\uff09\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u53ef\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5f25\u8865\u4f4e\u80fd\u529b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u80fd\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff09\u5bf9\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u60c5\u611f\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\uff09\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u3001\u7279\u522b\u662f\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u76f8\u4e92\u8865\u507f\u5730\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75282\u00d72\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u9ad8/\u4f4e\uff1b\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\uff1a\u9ad8/\u4f4e\uff09\uff0c\u8ba9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e0e\u4eff\u72d7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u8865\u507f\u4f4e\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0d\u5177\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u4f4e\u80fd\u529b\u5219\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d7\u4f20\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d7\u60c5\u611f\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\uff09\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u2018\u60c5\u611f\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\u2019\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4fe1\u4efb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we leverage an efficient physically based reflectance model to enable relighting and editing of these intrinsic material maps.

However, GUI automation includes a wide range of tasks, from document processing to online shopping, from CAD to video editing. Diversity between particular tasks requires MLLMs for GUI automation to have heterogeneous capabilities and master multidimensional expertise, raising problems on constructing such a model. To address such challenge, we propose GAIR: GUI Automation via Information-Joint Reasoning and Group Reflection, a novel MLLM-based GUI automation agent framework designed for integrating knowledge and combining capabilities from heterogeneous models to build GUI automation agent systems with higher performance. Since different GUI-specific MLLMs are trained on different dataset and thus have different strengths, GAIR introduced a general-purpose MLLM for jointly processing the information from multiple GUI-specific models, further enhancing performance of the agent framework. The general-purpose MLLM also serves as decision maker, trying to execute a reasonable operation based on previously gathered information. When the general-purpose model thinks that there isn't sufficient information for a reasonable decision, GAIR would transit into group reflection status, where the general-purpose model would provide GUI-specific models with different instructions and hints based on their strengths and weaknesses, driving them to gather information with more significance and accuracy that can support deeper reasoning and decision.

We interestingly observe that, even when video frames are scrambled, models perform very well on the existing benchmarks by comprehensive experiments. This implies that VLMMs may not necessarily rely on accurate sequential processing of visual events, but instead depend on prior knowledge of typical scenarios to answer the question. To benchmark temporal understanding capabilities in VLMMs, we propose VECTOR, designed to explicitly assess a model's ability to identify the temporal order of events. On this benchmark, we observe that various VLMMs often fail to understand the orders of events. To address this, we propose MECOT (Multi-Event instruction fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought), which (1) trains models on detailed, event-by-event video descriptions and (2) using chain-of-thought prompts at inference to enhance temporal awareness.

However, retrieved documents often include information that is either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language model based compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor, improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy reducing documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faACoRN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u62bd\u8c61\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6587\u6863\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u542b\u8bef\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u62bd\u8c61\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u5ea6\u4f46\u542b\u65e0\u5173\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u65f6\uff0c\u6613\u9057\u6f0f\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u56e0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faACoRN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5bf9\u4e24\u7c7b\u68c0\u7d22\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6587\u6863\u53ca\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u805a\u7126\u751f\u6210\u76f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u6458\u8981\u3002", "result": "T5-large\u4f5c\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u91c7\u7528ACoRN\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u5728EM\u548cF1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u7b54\u6848\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u5728\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u5e72\u6270\u6587\u6863\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "ACoRN\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u62bd\u8c61\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5728\u771f\u5b9eRAG\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper investigates how such hallucinations influence users' trust in LLMs and users' interaction with LLMs. To explore this in everyday use, we conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants. Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection.

While recent progress in nonconvex guidance and control is paving the way for onboard autonomous trajectory optimization, these methods still rely on extensive expert input (e.g., waypoints, constraints, mission timelines, etc.), which limits the operational scalability in real rendezvous missions.This paper introduces SAGES (Semantic Autonomous Guidance Engine for Space), a trajectory-generation framework that translates natural-language commands into spacecraft trajectories that reflect high-level intent while respecting nonconvex constraints. Experiments in two settings -- fault-tolerant proximity operations with continuous-time constraint enforcement and a free-flying robotic platform -- demonstrate that SAGES reliably produces trajectories aligned with human commands, achieving over 90\\% semantic-behavioral consistency across diverse behavior modes.

Existing 3D world generation models remain limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a scale-aware 3D representation capable of generating and rendering content with largely different spatial sizes. WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to \"zoom into\" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features. Experiments demonstrate that WonderZoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video and 3D models in both quality and alignment, enabling multi-scale 3D world creation from a single image.

Nidd"], "title": "Supporting Dynamic Agentic Workloads: How Data and Agents Interact", "comment": null, "summary": "The rise of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and specialized reasoning agents exposes fundamental limitations in today's data management architectures. Traditional databases and data fabrics were designed for static, well-defined workloads, whereas agentic systems exhibit dynamic, context-driven, and collaborative behaviors. Agents continuously decompose tasks, shift attention across modalities, and share intermediate results with peers - producing non-deterministic, multi-modal workloads that strain conventional query optimizers and caching mechanisms. We propose an Agent-Centric Data Fabric, a unified architecture that rethinks how data systems serve, optimize, coordinate, and learn from agentic workloads. To achieve this we exploit the concepts of attention-guided data retrieval, semantic micro-caching for context-driven agent federations, predictive data prefetching and quorum-based data serving. Together, these mechanisms enable agents to access representative data faster and more efficiently, while reducing redundant queries, data movement, and inference load across systems. By framing data systems as adaptive collaborators, instead of static executors, we outline new research directions toward behaviorally responsive data infrastructures, where caching, probing, and orchestration jointly enable efficient, context-rich data exchange among dynamic, reasoning-driven agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u67b6\u6784\u2014\u2014Agent-Centric Data Fabric\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5fae\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u9884\u53d6\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4eba\u6570\u7684\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u7b49\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7ec7\u7f51\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u3001\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u53ca\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgent-Centric Data Fabric\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u9762\u5411\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5fae\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6570\u636e\u9884\u53d6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4eba\u6570\uff08quorum-based\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u6267\u884c\u8005\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534f\u4f5c\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9700\u8f6c\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f16\u6392\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5bcc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\uff1b\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community.

We address extrinsic hallucinations (flawed internal knowledge) by creating a novel training set from open-ended conversions of TriviaQA. Concurrently, we tackle intrinsic hallucinations (unfaithfulness to context) by leveraging long-form texts from FineWeb in a fact-grounding reward scheme.

First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations.

We initiate the study of such intent inference using a variant of a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF), subject to the assumption that the agent's intent manifests through closed-loop behavior with a state-of-the-art provable practical stability property. Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample. We quantify how well the adversary can recover the agent's intent using information-theoretic leakage metrics and provide computable lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true intent distribution and RBPF estimates via Gaussian-mixture KL bounds. We also provide a bound on the difference in performance between the two estimators, highlighting the fact that the reduced estimator performs almost as well as the complete one.

However, the high-dimensional configuration space, nonlinear dynamics, and frequent partial occlusions present fundamental barriers to robust real-time DLO tracking. To address these limitations, this study introduces UPETrack, a geometry-driven framework based on Unidirectional Position Estimation (UPE), which facilitates tracking without the requirement for physical modeling, virtual simulation, or visual markers. The framework operates in two phases: (1) visible segment tracking is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and (2) occlusion region prediction employing UPE algorithm we proposed. UPE leverages the geometric continuity inherent in DLO shapes and their temporal evolution patterns to derive a closed-form positional estimator through three principal mechanisms: (i) local linear combination displacement term, (ii) proximal linear constraint term, and (iii) historical curvature term. This analytical formulation allows efficient and stable estimation of occluded nodes through explicit linear combinations of geometric components, eliminating the need for additional iterative optimization.

Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from inefficient exploration and fails to scale to large scenarios. We propose PGF-MAPPO (Path-Guided Frontier MAPPO), a hierarchical framework bridging topological planning with reactive control. To resolve local minima and sparse rewards, we integrate an A*-based potential field for dense reward shaping. Furthermore, we introduce Directional Frontier Allocation, combining Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) with geometric angle suppression to enforce spatial dispersion and accelerate coverage.

This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups. This encourages a more neutral representation in terms of demographic attributes. We evaluate UTIE using three VLMs, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and SigLIP, on two widely used benchmarks, RFW and BFW, designed to assess bias in FR. Experimental results show that UTIE consistently reduces bias metrics while maintaining, or even improving in several cases, the face verification accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff08UTIE\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ec4\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u8138\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u524a\u5f31\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u9762\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUTIE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528CLIP\u3001OpenCLIP\u548cSigLIP\u7b49VLMs\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u67d0\u4e00\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6765\u81ea\u5176\u4ed6\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6587\u672c\u884d\u751f\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8eab\u4efd\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728RFW\u548cBFW\u4e24\u4e2a\u504f\u89c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUTIE\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVLMs\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u89c1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u8138\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "UTIE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8868\u5f81\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) display an increasing ability to generate reflective texts, raising questions regarding the relationship between linguistic form and mental representation. This study assesses the extent to which a single LLM can reproduce the linguistic structure of mentalization according to the parameters of Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT).\n  Methods: Fifty dialogues were generated between human participants and an LLM configured in standard mode. Five psychiatrists trained in MBT, working under blinded conditions, evaluated the mentalization profiles produced by the model along the four MBT axes, assigning Likert-scale scores for evaluative coherence, argumentative coherence, and global quality. Inter-rater agreement was estimated using ICC(3,1).\n  Results: Mean scores (3.63-3.98) and moderate standard deviations indicate a high level of structural coherence in the generated profiles. ICC values (0.60-0.84) show substantial-to-high agreement among raters.

While recent progress has advanced text-based RAG to multi-turn reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), extending these advances to hybrid retrieval introduces additional challenges. Existing graph-based or hybrid systems typically depend on fixed or handcrafted retrieval pipelines, lacking the ability to integrate supplementary evidence as reasoning unfolds. Besides, while graph evidence provides relational structures crucial for multi-hop reasoning, it is substantially more expensive to retrieve. To address these limitations, we introduce \\model{}, an RL-based framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-turn and adaptive graph-text hybrid RAG. \\model{} jointly optimizes the entire generation process via RL, allowing the model to learn when to reason, what to retrieve from either texts or graphs, and when to produce final answers, all within a unified generation policy. To guide this learning process, we design a two-stage training framework that accounts for both task outcome and retrieval efficiency, enabling the model to exploit hybrid evidence while avoiding unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experimental results across five question answering benchmarks demonstrate that \\model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, highlighting the benefits of end-to-end RL in supporting adaptive and efficient retrieval for complex reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u8054\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6216\u6df7\u5408RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a/\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5165\u8865\u5145\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u4e14\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6587\u672c/\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709RAG\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aefRL\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u56fe-\u6587\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3aRAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We present BiDemoSyn, a framework that synthesizes contact-rich, physically feasible bimanual demonstrations from a single real-world example. The key idea is to decompose tasks into invariant coordination blocks and variable, object-dependent adjustments, then adapt them through vision-guided alignment and lightweight trajectory optimization. This enables the generation of thousands of diverse and feasible demonstrations within several hour, without repeated teleoperation or reliance on imperfect simulation. Across six dual-arm tasks, we show that policies trained on BiDemoSyn data generalize robustly to novel object poses and shapes, significantly outperforming recent baselines.

We cast the problem in a computational-geometric framework by relating the coverage problem and line-of-sight constraints to the Cooperative Guard Art Gallery Problem, and introduce its partially observable variant, the Partially Observable Cooperative Guard Art Gallery Problem (POCGAGP). We then present two algorithms that solve POCGAGP: CADENCE, a centralized planner that incrementally selects 270 degree corners at which to deploy agents, and DADENCE, a decentralized scheme that coordinates agents using local information and lightweight messaging.

We evaluate the methods in simulation across 1,500 test cases of varied size and structure, demonstrating consistent success in forming connected networks while covering and exploring unknown space.

While recent consistency models offer promising one-step generation for \\textit{unconditional synthesis}, their application to \\textit{conditional enhancement} remains unexplored. We present \\textbf{Consist-Retinex}, the first framework adapting consistency modeling to Retinex-based low-light enhancement. Our key insight is that conditional enhancement requires fundamentally different training dynamics than unconditional generation standard consistency training focuses on low-noise regions near the data manifold, while conditional mapping critically depends on large-noise regimes that bridge degraded inputs to enhanced outputs. We introduce two core innovations: (1) a \\textbf{dual-objective consistency loss} combining temporal consistency with ground-truth alignment under randomized time sampling, providing full-spectrum supervision for stable convergence; and (2) an \\textbf{adaptive noise-emphasized sampling strategy} that prioritizes training on large-noise regions essential for one-step conditional generation.

Today's dominant tools trade off speed and flexibility: lexical classifiers (e.g., FastText) are fast but limited to producing classification output scores, while the vector-valued outputs of transformer text embedding models flexibly support numerous workflows (e.g., clustering, classification, and retrieval) but are computationally expensive to produce. We introduce Luxical, a library for high-speed \"lexical-dense\" text embeddings that aims to recover the best properties of both approaches for web-scale text organization. Luxical combines sparse TF--IDF features, a small ReLU network, and a knowledge distillation training regimen to approximate large transformer embedding models at a fraction of their operational cost. In this technical report, we describe the Luxical architecture and training objective and evaluate a concrete Luxical model in two disparate applications: a targeted webcrawl document retrieval test and an end-to-end language model data curation task grounded in text classification. In these tasks we demonstrate speedups ranging from 3x to 100x over varying-sized neural baselines, and comparable to FastText model inference during the data curation task. On these evaluations, the tested Luxical model illustrates favorable compute/quality trade-offs for large-scale text organization, matching the quality of neural baselines.

While recent foundation models offer strong semantic reasoning, existing robotic task planners remain predominantly unimanual and fail to address the spatial, geometric, and coordination challenges inherent to bimanual manipulation in scene-agnostic settings. We present a unified framework for scene-agnostic bimanual task planning that bridges high-level reasoning with 3D-grounded two-handed execution. Our approach integrates three key modules. Visual Point Grounding (VPG) analyzes a single scene image to detect relevant objects and generate world-aligned interaction points. Bimanual Subgoal Planner (BSP) reasons over spatial adjacency and cross-object accessibility to produce compact, motion-neutralized subgoals that exploit opportunities for coordinated two-handed actions. Interaction-Point-Driven Bimanual Prompting (IPBP) binds these subgoals to a structured skill library, instantiating synchronized unimanual or bimanual action sequences that satisfy hand-state and affordance constraints. Together, these modules enable agents to plan semantically meaningful, physically feasible, and parallelizable two-handed behaviors in cluttered, previously unseen scenes. Experiments show that it produces coherent, feasible, and compact two-handed plans, and generalizes to cluttered scenes without retraining, demonstrating robust scene-agnostic affordance reasoning for bimanual tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u3001\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u793a\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u9ad8\u5c42\u6307\u4ee4\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u5355\u624b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6240\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u534f\u8c03\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u89c9\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08VPG\uff09\u3001\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\uff08BSP\uff09\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u793a\uff08IPBP\uff09\u7684\u4e09\u6a21\u5757\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u4e14\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u7406\u3001\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u573a\u666f\u65e0\u5173\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.\n  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-\"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition\"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.\n  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f02\u8d28\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e3b\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5411\u91cf\uff08\u2018\u62bd\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u2019\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4f20\u64ad\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6620\u5c04\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u51c6\u5219\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u7ed3\u8bba\u2018\u65e0\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u2019\u5c06\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u800c\u975e\u8bf4\u670d\u6216\u6743\u5a01\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u4e0eAI\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u8d28\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u610f\u4e49\u4f20\u9012\u4e0e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4ee3\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u523b\u753b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5b58\u7eed\u3001\u626d\u66f2\u4e0e\u6d88\u4ea1\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u2018\u65e0\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u9886\u5bfc\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u2019\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5931\u771f\u3001\u52a8\u673a\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u76f8\u4e92\u7406\u89e3\u9650\u5ea6\u5747\u6e90\u4e8e\u7eaf\u4ee3\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u62bd\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u53d8\u5f02\u4e0e\u6d88\u5931\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u7a7f\u8d8a\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u610f\u4e49\u4fdd\u5b58\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u517c\u5bb9\u800c\u975e\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u7406\u6027\uff1b\u8be5\u8ba4\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8de8\u5f02\u8d28\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u666e\u9002\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6HSCP\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfUAV\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60RFFI\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHSCP\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8eCKA\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u4fdd\u969c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728UAV-M100\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHSCP\u5bf9ResNet18\u5b9e\u73b086.39%\u53c2\u6570\u538b\u7f29\u300184.44% FLOPs\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.49%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4f4eSNR\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HSCP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u6781\u81f4\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4f4e\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bc6\u522b\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Traditional rule-based clinical decision support systems struggle with unstructured dental narratives, incomplete radiographic descriptions, and complex safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Knowledge-Guided Large Language Model (KG-LLM) that integrates a pediatric dental knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-stage safety validation pipeline for evidence-grounded antibiotic recommendation. The framework first employs a clinical NER/RE module to extract structured entities and relations from dental notes and radiology reports. Relevant guidelines, drug-safety rules, and analogous historical cases are subsequently retrieved from the knowledge graph and supplied to the LLM for diagnostic summarization and dose-drug-duration prediction. Safety assurance is achieved through a dual-layer validation mechanism combining deterministic rule checking with a learned classifier for detecting allergies, contraindications, and dosing errors. Experiments on 32,000 de-identified pediatric dental visit records demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with a domain-adapted Llama-2 clinical baseline, KG-LLM improves record-understanding performance (F1: 0.914 vs. 0.867), drug-dose-duration accuracy (Top-1: 0.782 vs. 0.716), and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 50%. Additional evaluation across summary quality, recommendation accuracy, and global safety scores further confirms the robustness of the system.

This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations.

In GPS-denied or cluttered urban environments, perception-based landing is vital for reliable operation. Unlike structured landing zones, real-world sites are unstructured and highly variable, requiring strong generalization capabilities from the perception system. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges. Payload and volume constraints limit high-performance edge AI devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which are crucial for real-time detection and control. Accurate pose estimation during descent is necessary, especially in the absence of GPS, and relies on dependable visual-inertial odometry. Achieving this with limited edge AI resources requires careful optimization of the entire deployment framework. The flight characteristics of large QuadPlanes further complicate the problem. These aircraft exhibit high inertia, reduced thrust vectoring, and slow response times further complicate stable landing maneuvers.

However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506\u00b0 and a root mean squared error of 0.1957\u00b0, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs. Experimental evaluations achieve 95% accuracy in UGV detection. This work contributes a vision-based, infrastructure- independent solution that demonstrates strong potential for deployment in GPS/GNSS-denied environments, supporting reliable multi-agent coordination under realistic dynamic conditions.

However, LLMs struggle to interpret the relational and topological information in these inputs, resulting in hallucinations that are inconsistent with the retrieved knowledge. To analyze how LLMs attend to and retain structured knowledge during generation, we propose two lightweight interpretability metrics: Path Reliance Degree (PRD), which measures over-reliance on shortest-path triples, and Semantic Alignment Score (SAS), which assesses how well the model's internal representations align with the retrieved knowledge. Through empirical analysis on a knowledge-based QA task, we identify failure patterns associated with over-reliance on salient paths and weak semantic grounding, as indicated by high PRD and low SAS scores.

While recent methods leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through supervised learning on large-scale datasets to improve reasoning, they often lack robustness in novel scenarios. Conversely, reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches enhance adaptability but remain data-inefficient and lack transparent decision-making. % contribution To address these limitations, we propose COVLM-RL, a novel end-to-end driving framework that integrates Critical Object-oriented (CO) reasoning with VLM-guided RL. Specifically, we design a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy that enables the VLM to reason over critical traffic elements and generate high-level semantic decisions, effectively transforming multi-view visual inputs into structured semantic decision priors. These priors reduce the input dimensionality and inject task-relevant knowledge into the RL loop, accelerating training and improving policy interpretability. However, bridging high-level semantic guidance with continuous low-level control remains non-trivial. To this end, we introduce a consistency loss that encourages alignment between the VLM's semantic plans and the RL agent's control outputs, enhancing interpretability and training stability. Experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that COVLM-RL significantly improves the success rate by 30\\% in trained driving environments and by 50\\% in previously unseen environments, highlighting its strong generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCOVLM-RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5173\u952e\u7269\u4f53\u5bfc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u51b3\u7b56\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728CARLA\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u73b0\u6709VLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65b0\u573a\u666f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCOVLM-RL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u5411\u5173\u952e\u4ea4\u901a\u8981\u7d20\u7684Chain-of-Thought\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528VLM\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u51b3\u7b56\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u8be5\u5148\u9a8c\u6ce8\u5165RL\u5faa\u73af\u4ee5\u964d\u7ef4\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u9f50VLM\u8bed\u4e49\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0eRL\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728CARLA\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0cCOVLM-RL\u5728\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534730%\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u534750%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u53ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "COVLM-RL\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408VLM\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eRL\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In our study, we investigated this potential using robust psychometric measures. We adapted the most studied test in psychological literature, namely Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and examined LLMs' behavior to identify traits. To asses the sensitivity of LLMs' prompts and psychological biases we created personality-oriented prompts, crafting a detailed set of personas that vary in trait intensity. This enables us to measure how well LLMs follow these roles. Our study introduces MindShift, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' psychological adaptability.

Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTrio\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9776\u5411\u5206\u5b50\u4ece\u5934\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u3001\u7c7b\u836f\u6027\u548c\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u952e\u836f\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrio\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u7ec4\u88c5\u3001\u7406\u5316\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "Trio\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u836f\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u63d0\u53477.85%\uff0c\u7c7b\u836f\u6027\u63d0\u534711.10%\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u63d0\u534712.05%\uff0c\u5206\u5b50\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6269\u5927\u56db\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "Trio\u4e3a\u9776\u5411\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To achieve precise load manipulation, existing methods often rely on extra sensors to measure cable directions or the payload's pose, which increases the system cost and complexity. A fundamental question remains: is the payload's pose observable under multi-source disturbances using only the drones' odometry information? To answer this question, this work focuses on the two-drone-bar system and proves that the whole system is observable when only two or fewer types of lumped disturbances exist by using the observability rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present such a conclusion and this result paves the way for more cost-effective and robust systems by minimizing their sensor suites. Next, to validate this analysis, we consider the situation where the disturbances are only exerted on the drones, and develop a composite disturbance filtering scheme. A disturbance observer-based error-state extended Kalman filter is designed for both state and disturbance estimation, which renders improved estimation performance for the whole system evolving on the manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^3)^2\\times(TS^2)^3$. Our simulation and experimental tests have validated that it is possible to fully estimate the state and disturbance of the system with only odometry information of the drones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a-\u6a2a\u6746\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4ec5\u9700\u4e24\u53f0\u6216\u66f4\u5c11\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u542b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u59ff\u6001\uff09\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u72b6\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u6270\u52a8\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u540c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8f93\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982\u6d4b\u7f06\u65b9\u5411\u6216\u8f7d\u8377\u4f4d\u59ff\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u672c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff1b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff1a\u4ec5\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f4d\u59ff\uff1f", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u79e9\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u53cc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a-\u6a2a\u6746\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u4ec5\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u5408\u6270\u52a8\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u6d41\u5f62 $(\\mathbb{R}^3)^2\\times(TS^2)^3$ \u4e0a\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u8bef\u5dee\u72b6\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08DO-ESEKF\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u6270\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u4e24\u7c7b\u6216\u66f4\u5c11\u7c7b\u578b\u96c6\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\uff1b\u6240\u63d0DO-ESEKF\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u4ec5\u51ed\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5168\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u542b\u8d1f\u8f7d\u59ff\u6001\uff09\u53ca\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1f\u8f7d\u59ff\u6001\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8f93\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Without early diagnosis, DR can lead to vision loss. Fundus photography captures the structure of the retina along with abnormalities indicative of the stage of the disease. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support clinicians in identifying these lesions, reducing manual workload, but models require high-quality annotated datasets. Due to the complexity of retinal structures, errors in image acquisition and lesion interpretation of manual annotators can occur. We proposed a quality-control framework, ensuring only high-standard data is used for evaluation and AI training. First, an explainable feature-based classifier is used to filter inadequate images. The features are extracted both using image processing and contrastive learning. Then, the images are enhanced and put subject to annotation, using deep-learning-based assistance. Lastly, the agreement between annotators calculated using derived formulas determines the usability of the annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\uff08DR\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8f85\u52a9\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u6ce8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347AI\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u7528\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\uff08DR\uff09\u9700\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u4ee5\u9632\u89c6\u529b\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u800cAI\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u4f46\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6613\u53d7\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7b5b\u9009\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u5408\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8f85\u52a9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u516c\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u5224\u5b9a\u6807\u6ce8\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5254\u9664\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u7eedAI\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cfAI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, such approaches critically rely on the assumption that proxy reward models accurately reflect intended supervision, a condition often violated due to annotation noise, bias, or limited coverage. This misalignment can lead to undesirable behaviors, where models optimize for flawed signals rather than true human values. In this paper, we investigate a novel framework to identify and mitigate such misalignment by treating the fine-tuning process as a form of knowledge integration. We focus on detecting instances of proxy-policy conflicts, cases where the base model strongly disagrees with the proxy. We argue that such conflicts often signify areas of shared ignorance, where neither the policy nor the reward model possesses sufficient knowledge, making them especially susceptible to misalignment. To this end, we propose two complementary metrics for identifying these conflicts: a localized Proxy-Policy Alignment Conflict Score (PACS) and a global Kendall-Tau Distance measure. Building on this insight, we design an algorithm named Selective Human-in-the-loop Feedback via Conflict-Aware Sampling (SHF-CAS) that targets high-conflict QA pairs for additional feedback, refining both the reward model and policy efficiently. Experiments on two alignment tasks demonstrate that our approach enhances general alignment performance, even when trained with a biased proxy reward. Our work provides a new lens for interpreting alignment failures and offers a principled pathway for targeted refinement in LLM training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406-\u7b56\u7565\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PACS\u548cKendall-Tau\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6b67\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5373\u2018\u5171\u540c\u65e0\u77e5\u2019\u533a\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1SHF-CAS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u51b2\u7a81\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u56e0\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u53d7\u6807\u6ce8\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7406-\u7b56\u7565\u51b2\u7a81\uff08\u5373\u57fa\u5ea7\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u70c8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u6307\u6807PACS\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6307\u6807Kendall-Tau\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1SHF-CAS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u51b2\u7a81QA\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u504f\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u51b2\u7a81\u533a\u57df\u88ab\u8bc1\u5b9e\u591a\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u7f3a\u4e4f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u2018\u5171\u540c\u65e0\u77e5\u2019\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7406-\u7b56\u7565\u51b2\u7a81\u662f\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u6548\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5316\u7cbe\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u7406\u6027\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective. This enables 3DID to generate high-fidelity 3D geometries, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and design versatility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a3D Inverse Design (3DID)\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d562D\u6295\u5f71\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u5df2\u67093D\u5f62\u72b6\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f53\u79ef\u7ec6\u8282\u635f\u5931\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7206\u70b8\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u91c7\u75282D\u6295\u5f71\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u5df2\u67093D\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e22\u5931\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u7ec6\u8282\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u771f\u6b633D\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3DID\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u7406-\u51e0\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u5f81\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u573a\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u63a2\u7d22\u5168\u5c40\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u4fdd\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "3DID\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "3DID\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u3001\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u76843D\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This token-first paradigm leads to drift, inconsistent reasoning modes, and growing prompts as conversations deepen. We propose CORE, a concept-first interaction layer that improves multi-turn stability without modifying model weights. CORE combines a small library of universal cognitive operators with a persistent Local Concept - a compact semantic state capturing the task, constraints, preferences, and intermediate results. Each model call receives only this concept state, the user's latest instruction, and the selected operator, eliminating the need to replay full history. A preliminary prototype simulating CORE's behavior shows about 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this number reflects prototype conditions and should not be interpreted as a real-world performance estimate.

Existing methods are limited by transfer settings that assume homogeneous domains or heterogeneous scenarios with only co-occurring categories. When label spaces do not overlap, they further rely on complete source-domain coverage and therefore overlook critical target-private information. To overcome these limitations and enable knowledge transfer in fully heterogeneous settings, we propose Cross-scene Knowledge Integration (CKI), a framework that explicitly incorporates target-private knowledge during transfer. CKI includes: (1) Alignment of Spectral Characteristics (ASC) to reduce spectral discrepancies through domain-agnostic projection; (2) Cross-scene Knowledge Sharing Preference (CKSP), which resolves semantic mismatch via a Source Similarity Mechanism (SSM); and (3) Complementary Information Integration (CII) to maximize the use of target-specific complementary cues. Extensive experiments verify that CKI achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong stability across diverse cross-scene HSI scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCross-scene Knowledge Integration (CKI)\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u573a\u666f\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u96be\u9898\u3002CKI\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u53ca\u76ee\u6807\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5f02\u6784\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u8de8\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u573a\u666f\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u6e90\u57df\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCKI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) ASC\u6a21\u5757\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u6295\u5f71\u51cf\u5c0f\u5149\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b(2) CKSP\u6a21\u5757\u2014\u2014\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff08SSM\uff09\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u914d\uff1b(3) CII\u6a21\u5757\u2014\u2014\u6574\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7279\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCKI\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51faSOTA\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CKI\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u5f02\u6784\uff08\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u573a\u666f\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff09\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u79c1\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e3aHSI\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

These capabilities stem primarily from the self-attention mechanism, which enables modeling of long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length poses significant computational and memory challenges, especially as sequence length extends to extremes. While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08TCA-Attention\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952etoken\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u538b\u7f29KV\u7f13\u5b58\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987eprefill\u4e0edecode\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56e0\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u8d85\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTCA-Attention\uff1ai) \u79bb\u7ebf\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u786e\u5b9a\u5404\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u9884\u7b97\uff1bii) \u5728\u7ebf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u7b5b\u9009\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587token\uff1b\u5168\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e0d\u6539\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728128K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b02.8\u00d7\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u51cf\u5c1161%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "TCA-Attention\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316prefill\u4e0edecode\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

However, dense SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging. Most methods directly remove dynamic objects and focus solely on static scene reconstruction, which ignores the motion information contained in these dynamic objects. In this paper, we present D$^2$GSLAM, a novel dynamic SLAM system utilizing Gaussian representation, which simultaneously performs accurate dynamic reconstruction and robust tracking within dynamic environments. Our system is composed of four key components: (i) We propose a geometric-prompt dynamic separation method to distinguish between static and dynamic elements of the scene. This approach leverages the geometric consistency of Gaussian representation and scene geometry to obtain coarse dynamic regions. The regions then serve as prompts to guide the refinement of the coarse mask for achieving accurate motion mask. (ii) To facilitate accurate and efficient mapping of the dynamic scene, we introduce dynamic-static composite representation that integrates static 3D Gaussians with dynamic 4D Gaussians. This representation allows for modeling the transitions between static and dynamic states of objects in the scene for composite mapping and optimization.

Submitted to FM 2026", "summary": "Verifying closed-loop vision-based control systems remains a fundamental challenge due to the high dimensionality of images and the difficulty of modeling visual environments. While generative models are increasingly used as camera surrogates in verification, their reliance on stochastic latent variables introduces unnecessary overapproximation error. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Deterministic World Model (DWM) that maps system states directly to generative images, effectively eliminating uninterpretable latent variables to ensure precise input bounds. The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system. We integrate DWM into a verification pipeline utilizing Star-based reachability analysis (StarV) and employ conformal prediction to derive rigorous statistical bounds on the trajectory deviation between the world model and the actual vision-based system. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our approach yields significantly tighter reachable sets and better verification performance than a latent-variable baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08DWM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u968f\u673a\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0eStarV\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u56fe\u50cf\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u673a\u4ee3\u7406\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08DWM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5dee\u5f02\u635f\u5931\u6784\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u96c6\u6210StarV\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u7edf\u8ba1\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u542b\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u96c6\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "DWM\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u95ed\u73af\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While detection models show strong performance, they have the capacity to cause significant negative impacts. We explore potential biases in English machine-generated text detection systems. We curate a dataset of student essays and assess 16 different detection systems for bias across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts.

RoboCup, an international competition of fully autonomous humanoid robots, provides a uniquely challenging benchmark for such systems, culminating in the long-term goal of competing against human soccer players by 2050. This paper presents the hardware and software innovations underlying our team's victory in the RoboCup 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer Competition. On the hardware side, we introduce an adult-sized humanoid platform built with lightweight structural components, high-torque quasi-direct-drive actuators, and a specialized foot design that enables powerful in-gait kicks while preserving locomotion robustness. On the software side, we develop an integrated perception and localization framework that combines stereo vision, object detection, and landmark-based fusion to provide reliable estimates of the ball, goals, teammates, and opponents. A mid-level navigation stack then generates collision-aware, dynamically feasible trajectories, while a centralized behavior manager coordinates high-level decision making, role selection, and kick execution based on the evolving game state. The seamless integration of these subsystems results in fast, precise, and tactically effective gameplay, enabling robust performance under the dynamic and adversarial conditions of real matches.

Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCONCUR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u975e\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u7531\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u591a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u7531\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u5165\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316CONCUR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u878d\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u5e26\u9884\u7b97\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e26\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8def\u7531\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cCONCUR\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "CONCUR\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u591a\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u8def\u7531\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4f4e\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8def\u7531\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The Act-Then-Measure (ATM) heuristic addresses this challenge by decoupling control and measurement actions within the Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable Markov Decision Process (ACNO-MDP) framework. However, the standard ATM algorithm relies on a temporal-difference-inspired Q-learning method, which is prone to instability in sparse and noisy environments. In this work, we propose a Bayesian extension to ATM that replaces standard Q-learning with a Kalman filter-style Bayesian update, maintaining uncertainty-aware estimates of Q-values and enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning. We evaluate our method in both toy environments and clinically motivated testbeds. In small, tabular environments, Bayesian ATM achieves comparable or improved scalarized returns with substantially lower variance and more stable policy behavior. In contrast, in larger and more complex mHealth settings, both the standard and Bayesian ATM variants perform poorly, suggesting a mismatch between ATM's modeling assumptions and the structural challenges of real-world mHealth domains. These findings highlight the value of uncertainty-aware methods in low-data settings while underscoring the need for new RL algorithms that explicitly model causal structure, continuous states, and delayed feedback under observation cost constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6269\u5c55\u7684Act-Then-Measure\uff08ATM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5f0f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u66ff\u4ee3Q\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347mHealth\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9emHealth\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\uff08mHealth\uff09\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u6743\u8861\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u800c\u72b6\u6001\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u95ee\u5377\uff09\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u73b0\u6709ATM\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684TD\u5f0fQ\u5b66\u4e60\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afATM\uff1a\u5728ACNO-MDP\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06ATM\u4e2d\u7684Q-learning\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5f0f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afQ\u503c\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u79bb\u6563\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afATM\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u65b9\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173mHealth\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afATM\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636emHealth\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dATM\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9emHealth\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

Instead of deciding from a single descriptor comparison or using fixed thresholds with late-stage Iterative Closest Point (ICP) vetting, the verifier accumulates a short temporal stream of descriptor similarities between a query and each candidate. It then issues an accept/reject decision adaptively once sufficient multi-frame evidence has been observed, according to user-specified Type-I/II error design targets. This precision-first policy is designed to suppress false positives in structurally repetitive indoor environments. We evaluate the verifier on a five-sequence library dataset, using a fixed retrieval front-end with several representative LiDAR global descriptors. Performance is assessed via segment-level K-hit precision-recall and absolute trajectory error (ATE) and relative pose error (RPE) after pose graph optimization.

Existing supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) approaches suffer from performance instability on known data due to their reliance on limited paired metal-clean data, which limits their clinical applicability. Moreover, existing unsupervised methods face two main challenges: 1) the CT physical geometry is not effectively incorporated into the MAR process to ensure data fidelity; 2) traditional heuristics regularization terms cannot fully capture the abundant prior knowledge available. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose diffusion model regularized implicit neural representation framework for MAR. The implicit neural representation integrates physical constraints and imposes data fidelity, while the pre-trained diffusion model provides prior knowledge to regularize the solution. Experimental results on both simulated and clinical data demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method, highlighting its potential to be applied to clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f2a\u5f71\u51cf\u5c11\uff08MAR\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763MAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u914d\u5bf9\u91d1\u5c5e-\u5e72\u51c0CT\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408CT\u7269\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u5d4c\u5165CT\u7269\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763MAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We evaluate ten cybersecurity professionals alongside six existing AI agents and ARTEMIS, our new agent scaffold, on a large university network consisting of ~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets. ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants. We observe that AI agents offer advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost -- certain ARTEMIS variants cost $18/hour versus $60/hour for professional penetration testers.

Yet screening agents must master conversational timing, prosody, backchannels, and what to attend to in faces and speech for Depression and PTSD. Most simulators omit policy learning with nonverbal dynamics; many controllers chase task accuracy while underweighting trust, pacing, and rapport. We virtualise the humanoid as a conversational agent to train without hardware burden. Our agent-centred, simulation-first pipeline turns interview data into 276 Unreal Engine MetaHuman patients with synchronised speech, gaze/face, and head-torso poses, plus PHQ-8 and PCL-C flows. A perception-fusion-policy loop decides what and when to speak, when to backchannel, and how to avoid interruptions, under a safety shield. Training uses counterfactual replay (bounded nonverbal perturbations) and an uncertainty-aware turn manager that probes to reduce diagnostic ambiguity. Results are simulation-only; the humanoid is the transfer target. In comparing three controllers, a custom TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG) outperformed PPO and CEM, achieving near-ceiling coverage with steadier pace at comparable rewards.

For elderly people with impaired physical abilities, support for toileting is one of the most important issues. This paper details the design, development, experimental assessment, and potential application of the gripper system, with a focus on the unique requirements and obstacles involved in aiding elderly or hemiplegic individuals in dressing and undressing trousers. The gripper we propose seeks to find the right balance between compliance and grasping forces, ensuring precise manipulation while maintaining a safe and compliant interaction with the users. The gripper's integration into a custom--built robotic manipulator system provides a comprehensive solution for assisting hemiplegic individuals in their dressing and undressing tasks. Experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing studies demonstrate the gripper's ability to successfully assist in both dressing and dressing of trousers in confined spaces with a high success rate.

Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN. These consistent gains demonstrate that our proposed methodology to generate defect datasets with pixel-level annotations is feasible for robust AI-based Measurement/Inspection (MI) in semiconductor fabrication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u64cd\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u5149\u523b\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Mask R-CNN\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eFaster R-CNN\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u884c\u4e1a\u5149\u523b\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4AI\u5728\u5fae\u7eb3\u5236\u9020\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\uff08\u8150\u8680\u4e0e\u81a8\u80c0\uff09\u4ece\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7248\u56fe\u51fa\u53d1\u5408\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7DMD\u5149\u523b\u6280\u672f\u5236\u4f5c\u5b9e\u7269\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u91c7\u96c6\u5149\u5b66\u663e\u5fae\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u914d\u5bf9\u7f3a\u9677/\u65e0\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u542b3530\u5f20\u5149\u5b66\u663e\u5fae\u56fe\u300113365\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff08\u6865\u63a5\u3001\u6bdb\u523a\u3001\u7f29\u9888\u3001\u6c61\u67d3\u56db\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1bMask R-CNN\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0aAP@0.5\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u7ea634%\uff0c\u6c61\u67d3\u7c7b\u63d0\u5347\u7ea642%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u652f\u6491\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5236\u9020\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Prior NLP efforts emphasize technical headnotes, ignoring citizen-oriented communication needs. We introduce CourtPressGER, a 6.4k dataset of triples: rulings, human-drafted press releases, and synthetic prompts for LLMs to generate comparable releases. This benchmark trains and evaluates LLMs in generating accurate, readable summaries from long judicial texts. We benchmark small and large LLMs using reference-based metrics, factual-consistency checks, LLM-as-judge, and expert ranking.

Through advances in self-supervised learning and foundation models, AI systems can now acquire and leverage domain knowledge without relying solely on human expertise. However, there is a lack of comprehensive analyses over the foundation models' performance on ECG. This study aims to answer the research question: \"Are Foundation Models Useful for ECG Analysis?\" To address it, we evaluate language/general time-series/ECG foundation models in comparison with time-series deep learning models. The experimental results show that general time-series/ECG foundation models achieve a top performance rate of 80%, indicating their effectiveness in ECG analysis.

To address the limitations of traditional financial decision methods that rely on parameterized knowledge, lack factual consistency, and miss reasoning chains, an integrated framework is proposed that combines external knowledge retrieval, semantic representation, and reasoning generation. The method first encodes financial texts and structured data to obtain semantic representations, and then retrieves task-related information from external knowledge bases using similarity computation. Internal representations and external knowledge are combined through weighted fusion, which ensures fluency while improving factual accuracy and completeness of generated content. In the reasoning stage, a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to construct logical chains, allowing the model to present transparent causal relationships and traceability during generation. Finally, the model jointly optimizes task objectives and explanation consistency objectives, which enhances predictive performance and reasoning interpretability. Experiments on financial text processing and decision tasks show that the method outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, text generation quality, and factual support, verifying the effectiveness of knowledge enhancement and explainable reasoning.

Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSCOPE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5206\u5c42\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u53cd\u590d\u8c03\u7528LLM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5728TextCraft\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8aADaPT\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece0.52\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.56\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece164.4\u79d2\u964d\u81f33.0\u79d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u73af\u5883\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14LLM\u53c2\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCOPE\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u793a\u8303\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u53d6LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u590dLLM\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728TextCraft\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u73870.56\uff08\u4f18\u4e8eADaPT\u76840.52\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u81f33.0\u79d2\uff08\u539f164.4\u79d2\uff09\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u4ecd\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5229\u7528LLM\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5212\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u727a\u7272\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002"}}

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on downstream tasks via fine-tuning, aligning with the semantic communication shift toward task-oriented understanding over bit-level accuracy.\n  Motivated by this, we propose Large Language Models for XL-MIMO Channel Estimation (LLM4XCE), a novel channel estimation framework that leverages the semantic modeling capabilities of large language models to recover essential spatial-channel representations for downstream tasks. The model integrates a carefully designed embedding module with Parallel Feature-Spatial Attention, enabling deep fusion of pilot features and spatial structures to construct a semantically rich representation for LLM input.

Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention.

LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries.

The framework includes text encoding, contextual representation modeling, attention-based enhancement, feature aggregation, and classification prediction. In the representation stage, deep semantic embeddings are obtained through large-scale pretrained language models, and attention mechanisms are applied to enhance the selective representation of key features. In the aggregation stage, global and weighted strategies are combined to generate robust text-level vectors. In the classification stage, a fully connected layer and Softmax output are used to predict class distributions, and cross-entropy loss is employed to optimize model parameters. Comparative experiments introduce multiple baseline models, including recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and Transformers, and evaluate them on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on all metrics, with especially strong improvements in Recall and AUC. In addition, sensitivity experiments are conducted on hyperparameters and data conditions, covering the impact of hidden dimensions on AUC and the impact of class imbalance ratios on Recall. The findings demonstrate that proper model configuration has a significant effect on performance and reveal the adaptability and stability of the model under different conditions. Overall, the proposed text classification method not only achieves effective performance improvement but also verifies its robustness and applicability in complex data environments through systematic analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u52a0\u6743\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728Recall\u548cAUC\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u52a0\u6743\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u3001\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42+Softmax\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728Precision\u3001Recall\u3001F1-Score\u548cAUC\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eRNN\u3001GNN\u548cTransformer\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176Recall\u548cAUC\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

A preliminary version of this work was presented at CALCO 2025, under the title \"An Algebraic Approach to Moralisation and Triangulation of Probabilistic Graphical Models''", "summary": "Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684moralisation\uff08\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\uff09\u548ctriangulation\uff08\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8303\u7574\u95f4\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u8bed\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\uff08\u6709\u5411vs\u65e0\u5411\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\uff1a\u5c06\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4ece\u2018\u8bed\u6cd5\u2019\u57df\u5230\u2018\u8bed\u4e49\u2019\u57df\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\uff1bmoralisation\u901a\u8fc7\u51fd\u5b50\u9884\u590d\u5408\u7eaf\u8bed\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1btriangulation\u5219\u9700\u8bed\u4e49\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u6d88\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9053\u5fb7\u5316\u4e0e\u4e09\u89d2\u5316\u7684\u51fd\u5b50\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u6d88\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u672c\u8eab\u4ea6\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fd\u5b50\uff1b\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u6362\u4e2d\u8bed\u6cd5\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5398\u6e05\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The resulting reactive safe navigation (REASAN) system achieves fully onboard and real-time reactive navigation across both single- and multi-robot settings in complex environments.

In this paper, we present an approach for searching and detecting a given entity in a video sequence.

The technique of detecting a character in a video is a complex field of study, considering the multitude of objects present in the data under analysis. From the results obtained, we highlight the following, compared to state of the art: In our approach, within the field of Computer Vision, the structuring of supervised learning algorithms allowed us to achieve several successes from simple characteristics of the target character. Our results demonstrate that is new approach allows us to locate, in an efficient way, wanted individuals from a private or public image base.

In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of LLM-SEs, analyzing 55,936 queries and the corresponding search results across six LLM-SEs and two TSEs. We confirm that LLM-SEs cites domain resources with greater diversity than TSEs. Indeed, 37% of domains are unique to LLM-SEs. However, certain risks still persist: LLM-SEs do not outperform TSEs in credibility, political neutrality and safety metrics. Finally, to understand the selection criteria of LLM-SEs, we perform a feature-based analysis to identify key factors influencing source choice.

To attain socially-desirable behaviors, autonomous vehicles must be instructed to consider the utility of other vehicles around them in their decision-making process. Particularly, we study the maneuver planning problem for autonomous vehicles and investigate how a decentralized reward structure can induce altruism in their behavior and incentivize them to account for the interest of other autonomous and human-driven vehicles. This is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity of a human driver's willingness to cooperate with an autonomous vehicle. Thus, in contrast with the existing works which rely on behavior models of human drivers, we take an end-to-end approach and let the autonomous agents to implicitly learn the decision-making process of human drivers only from experience. We introduce a multi-agent variant of the synchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm and train agents that coordinate with each other and can affect the behavior of human drivers to improve traffic flow and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u540c\u6b65A2C\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5229\u4ed6\u6027\u534f\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8ba9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u5468\u56f4\u8f66\u8f86\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\uff09\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u610f\u613f\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u540c\u6b65\u4f18\u52bf\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\uff08A2C\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u4ec5\u4ece\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u80fd\u76f8\u4e92\u534f\u8c03\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u884c\u8f66\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bf1\u5bfc\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5229\u4ed6\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5e94\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches rely heavily on task-specific models and domain-specific feature engineering.

This challenge stems from the need to balance racing speed and collision avoidance, limited feasible space causing policy exploration trapped in local optima during training, and perceptual ambiguity between gates and obstacles in depth maps-especially when gate positions are only coarsely specified. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-phase learning framework: an initial soft-collision training phase that preserves policy exploration for high-speed flight, followed by a hard-collision refinement phase that enforces robust obstacle avoidance. An adaptive, noise-augmented curriculum with an asymmetric actor-critic architecture gradually shifts the policy's reliance from privileged gate-state information to depth-based visual input. We further impose Lipschitz constraints and integrate a track-primitive generator to enhance motion stability and cross-environment generalization. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulation and ablation studies, and validate it in real-world experiments on a computationally constrained quadrotor. The system achieves agile flight while remaining robust to gate-position errors, developing a generalizable drone racing framework with the capability to operate in diverse, partially unknown and cluttered environments. https://yufengsjtu.github.io/MasterRacing.github.io/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u3001\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7ade\u901f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u78b0\u649e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u786c\u78b0\u649e\u7cbe\u8c03\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u53caLipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u901f\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u98de\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eRL\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u65e0\u969c\u8d5b\u9053\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u672a\u77e5\u3001\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u907f\u969c\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\u6613\u9677\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e2d\u95e8\u6846\u4e0e\u969c\u788d\u7269\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u7cca\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u95e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ec5\u7c97\u7565\u7ed9\u51fa\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8f6f\u78b0\u649e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u901f\u98de\u884c\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b2\uff09\u786c\u78b0\u649e\u7cbe\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u907f\u969c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0Actor-Critic\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u7279\u6743\u95e8\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u65bd\u52a0Lipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u539f\u8bed\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u95e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u654f\u6377\u7a33\u5065\u98de\u884c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u591a\u6837\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u672a\u77e5\u3001\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ade\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u9ad8\u901f\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In event streams, this optical artifact forms a complex, spatio-temporal distortion that has been largely overlooked. We present E-Deflare, the first systematic framework for removing lens flare from event camera data. We first establish the theoretical foundation by deriving a physics-grounded forward model of the non-linear suppression mechanism. This insight enables the creation of the E-Deflare Benchmark, a comprehensive resource featuring a large-scale simulated training set, E-Flare-2.7K, and the first-ever paired real-world test set, E-Flare-R, captured by our novel optical system.

In order to navigate safely in the presence of complex AV-HV social interactions, the AVs must learn to predict these changes. Humans are capable of navigating such challenging social interaction settings because of their intrinsic knowledge about other agents behaviors and use that to forecast what might happen in the future. Inspired by humans, we provide our AVs the capability of anticipating future states and leveraging prediction in a cooperative reinforcement learning (RL) decision-making framework, to improve safety and robustness. In this paper, we propose an integration of two essential and earlier-presented components of AVs: social navigation and prediction. We formulate the AV decision-making process as a RL problem and seek to obtain optimal policies that produce socially beneficial results utilizing a prediction-aware planning and social-aware optimization RL framework. We also propose a Hybrid Predictive Network (HPN) that anticipates future observations. The HPN is used in a multi-step prediction chain to compute a window of predicted future observations to be used by the value function network (VFN). Finally, a safe VFN is trained to optimize a social utility using a sequence of previous and predicted observations, and a safety prioritizer is used to leverage the interpretable kinematic predictions to mask the unsafe actions, constraining the RL policy. We compare our prediction-aware AV to state-of-the-art solutions and demonstrate performance improvements in terms of efficiency and safety in multiple simulated scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u793e\u4f1a\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u80fd\u9884\u5224\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u4f1a\u6301\u7eed\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u8c03\u6574\u81ea\u8eab\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4AV-HV\u4ea4\u4e92\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8d4b\u4e88AV\u7c7b\u4f3c\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06AV\u51b3\u7b56\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7684RL\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08HPN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7f51\u7edc\uff08VFN\uff09\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u4f18\u5148\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u5c4f\u853d\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ea6\u675fRL\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u9884\u6d4b\u611f\u77e5AV\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347AV\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings.

However, their widespread deployment currently suffers from methodological fragmentation and a lack of systematic soundness. This study proposes two comprehensive methodological frameworks designed to guide the strategic and responsible application of LLMs in language sciences. The first method-selection framework defines and systematizes three distinct, complementary approaches, each linked to a specific research goal: (1) prompt-based interaction with general-use models for exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation; (2) fine-tuning of open-source models for confirmatory, theory-driven investigation and high-quality data generation; and (3) extraction of contextualized embeddings for further quantitative analysis and probing of model internal mechanisms. We detail the technical implementation and inherent trade-offs of each method, supported by empirical case studies. Based on the method-selection framework, the second systematic framework proposed provides constructed configurations that guide the practical implementation of multi-stage research pipelines based on these approaches. We then conducted a series of empirical experiments to validate our proposed framework, employing retrospective analysis, prospective application, and an expert evaluation survey. By enforcing the strategic alignment of research questions with the appropriate LLM methodology, the frameworks enable a critical paradigm shift in language science research. We believe that this system is fundamental for ensuring reproducibility, facilitating the critical evaluation of LLM mechanisms, and providing the structure necessary to move traditional linguistics from ad-hoc utility to verifiable, robust science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u6027\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5e94\u7528\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u8005\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7814\u7a76\u6d41\u7a0b\u914d\u7f6e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u6eaf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u788e\u7247\u5316\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5411\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7814\u7a76\u6d41\u7a0b\u914d\u7f6e\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u6eaf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ca\u4e13\u5bb6\u95ee\u5377\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7814\u7a76\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u5357\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u53cc\u6846\u67b6\u4f53\u7cfb\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u79d1\u5b66\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc8\u5411\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u79d1\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002"}}

Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by antagonistic directional updates where new task gradients directly oppose the historical weight trajectory. To address this, we propose PS-LoRA (Parameter Stability LoRA), a framework designed to resolve conflicts by aligning updates within the optimization subspace. Our approach employs a dual-regularization objective that penalizes conflicting directions and constrains magnitude deviations to ensure consistency with prior knowledge. Additionally, we implement a magnitude-based merging strategy to consolidate sequential adapters into a robust representation without retraining.

Although 4D radar is suited for such environments, its sparse and noisy point clouds hinder accurate odometry estimation, while the radar maps suffer from obscure and incomplete structures. Thus, we propose Super4DR, a 4D radar-centric framework for learning-based odometry estimation and gaussian-based map optimization. First, we design a cluster-aware odometry network that incorporates object-level cues from the clustered radar points for inter-frame matching, alongside a hierarchical self-supervision mechanism to overcome outliers through spatio-temporal consistency, knowledge transfer, and feature contrast. Second, we propose using 3D gaussians as an intermediate representation, coupled with a radar-specific growth strategy, selective separation, and multi-view regularization, to recover blurry map areas and those undetected based on image texture.

LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SIP\uff08Site in Pieces\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u53cd\u6620\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u5b9e\u9645LiDAR\u91c7\u96c6\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u9762\u5411\u65bd\u5de5\u73af\u5883\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u4e09\u7ea7\u70b9\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67093D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u666f\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u788e\u7247\u5316\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7b49\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5f003D\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u878d\u5408\u3001\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u5730\u4e2d\u56e0\u5b89\u5168\u9650\u5236\u3001\u8bbf\u95ee\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5355\u7ad9\u5b64\u7acb\u626b\u63cf\u3001\u5f84\u5411\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aSIP\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u516c\u5f00\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5730\u9762LiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u83b7\u53d6\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u5411\u65bd\u5de5\u73af\u5883\u7684A/B/C\u4e09\u7ea7\u70b9\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff08\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u6784\u4ef6\u4e0e\u7ec6\u957f\u4e34\u65f6\u8bbe\u65bd\u5982\u811a\u624b\u67b6\u3001\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u526a\u53c9\u5347\u964d\u673a\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u89c4\u8303\u626b\u63cf\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f00\u6e90\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u73b0\u4ee33D\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u7c7b\u522b\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7eb3\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u666f\u7279\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u788e\u7247\u5316\u4e0e\u89c6\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u5272\u7684\u4e34\u65f6\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u70b9\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u5143\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u5e76\u914d\u5957Git\u4ed3\u5e93\u3002", "conclusion": "SIP\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5177\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u7279\u6027\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u5ea6\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5efa\u7b51\u9886\u57df3D\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Most existing structure-based attacks rely on gradient-based heuristics or local connectivity patterns, and treat edges as equally important candidates for manipulation. In this paper, we propose Spectral Edge Attacks (SEA), a new family of adversarial attacks that explicitly leverage spectral robustness evaluation to guide structural perturbations. Our key idea is to compute a spectral embedding that captures the most fragile directions of the input manifold and to use it to assign a robustness score to each edge or non-edge. Based on these scores, we introduce two complementary attack variants: (i) a Spade-guided deletion attack that removes the most spectrally robust edges, and (ii) a Spade-guided addition attack that inserts edges between nodes that are maximally incompatible in the fragile spectral space. Both attacks operate at the graph level, are model-aware but conceptually simple, and can be plugged into existing GNN architectures without requiring gradients. We describe the spectral formulation, the attack algorithms, and experiments on benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5Spectral Edge Attacks\uff08SEA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc6\u522b\u56fe\u4e2d\u6700\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u4e3a\u6bcf\u6761\u8fb9\u6216\u975e\u8fb9\u5206\u914d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6307\u5bfc\u8fb9\u5220\u9664\u4e0e\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e24\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56fe\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u68af\u5ea6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u8fb9\u89c6\u4e3a\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8fb9\u5728\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpectral Edge Attacks\uff08SEA\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u523b\u753b\u8f93\u5165\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u6700\u8106\u5f31\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u6761\u8fb9/\u975e\u8fb9\u8ba1\u7b97\u8c31\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\uff1aSpade\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5220\u9664\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5220\u6700\u9c81\u68d2\u8fb9\uff09\u548c\u6dfb\u52a0\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u8fde\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u6700\u5dee\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\uff09\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u4f46\u6982\u5ff5\u7b80\u6d01\u3002", "result": "SEA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c31\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1bSEA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u56fe\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86GNN\u5728\u8c31\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002"}}

However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening.

In addition to human annotations, the dataset includes scores generated by GPT-5 as an experiment on annotation automation.

However, incorporating an accurate representation of the environment to avoid obstacles without involving costly planning remains a challenge. In this work, we present ReMoSPLAT, a reactive controller based on a quadratic program formulation for mobile manipulation that leverages a Gaussian Splat representation for collision avoidance. By integrating additional constraints and costs into the optimisation formulation, a mobile manipulator platform can reach its intended end effector pose while avoiding obstacles, even in cluttered scenes. We investigate the trade-offs of two methods for efficiently calculating robot-obstacle distances, comparing a purely geometric approach with a rasterisation-based approach. Our experiments in simulation on both synthetic and real-world scans demonstrate the feasibility of our method, showing that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to controllers that rely on perfect ground-truth information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ReMoSPLAT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\uff08Gaussian Splat\uff09\u8868\u5f81\u73af\u5883\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u907f\u969c\u4e0e\u672b\u7aef\u4f4d\u59ff\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u878d\u5165\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u907f\u969c\uff0c\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReMoSPLAT\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\uff08Gaussian Splat\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9879\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u7eaf\u51e0\u4f55\u6cd5\u548c\u5149\u6805\u5316\u6cd5\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba-\u969c\u788d\u7269\u8ddd\u79bb\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u626b\u63cf\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u672b\u7aef\u4f4d\u59ff\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u907f\u969c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f9d\u8d56\u7406\u60f3\u771f\u503c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7ed8\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u7eb5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u878d\u5408\u9690\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This is a challenging problem because images of the same place may appear quite different for reasons including seasonal changes, weather illumination, structural changes to the environment, as well as transient pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Papers focusing on generating image descriptors for VPR report their results using metrics such as recall@K and ROC curves. However, for a robot implementation, determining which matches are sufficiently good is often reduced to a manually set threshold. And it is difficult to manually select a threshold that will work for a variety of visual scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of automatically selecting a threshold for VPR by looking at the 'negative' Gaussian mixture statistics for a place - image statistics indicating not this place. We show that this approach can be used to select thresholds that work well for a variety of image databases and image descriptors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff08VPR\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u9608\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5339\u914d\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5b63\u8282\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u5730\u70b9\u56fe\u50cf\u7684'\u8d1f\u6837\u672c'\uff08\u5373\u975e\u8be5\u5730\u70b9\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08GMM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u5bfc\u5339\u914d\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9608\u503c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1f\u6837\u672cGMM\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63d0\u5347VPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we introduce MentraSuite, a unified framework for advancing reliable mental-health reasoning.

We further present Mindora, a post-trained model optimized through a hybrid SFT-RL framework with an inconsistency-detection reward to enforce faithful and coherent reasoning. To support training, we construct high-quality trajectories using a novel reasoning trajectory generation strategy, that strategically filters difficult samples and applies a structured, consistency-oriented rewriting process to produce concise, readable, and well-balanced trajectories.

Despite their impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, as even minor meaning-preserving changes such as synonym substitutions can lead to incorrect predictions. As a result, certifying the robustness of LLMs against such adversarial prompts is of vital importance. Existing approaches focused on word deletion or simple denoising strategies to achieve robustness certification. However, these methods face two critical limitations: (1) they yield loose robustness bounds due to the lack of semantic validation for perturbed outputs and (2) they suffer from high computational costs due to repeated sampling. To address these limitations, we propose CluCERT, a novel framework for certifying LLM robustness via clustering-guided denoising smoothing. Specifically, to achieve tighter certified bounds, we introduce a semantic clustering filter that reduces noisy samples and retains meaningful perturbations, supported by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we enhance computational efficiency through two mechanisms: a refine module that extracts core semantics, and a fast synonym substitution strategy that accelerates the denoising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and jailbreak defense scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing certified approaches in both robustness bounds and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCluCERT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5982\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u8ba4\u8bc1\u754c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7f3a\u5931\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCluCERT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7b5b\u9009\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6837\u672c\u4ee5\u6536\u7d27\u8ba4\u8bc1\u754c\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cbe\u70bc\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8d8a\u72f1\u9632\u5fa1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCluCERT\u5728\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u754c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CluCERT\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u53bb\u566a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8ba4\u8bc1\u754c\u677e\u6563\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This work presents a solar-powered, fully autonomous USV featuring a novel syringe-based sampling architecture capable of acquiring 72 discrete, contamination-minimized water samples per mission. The vehicle incorporates a ROS 2 autonomy stack with GPS-RTK navigation, LiDAR and stereo-vision obstacle detection, Nav2-based mission planning, and long-range LoRa supervision, enabling dependable execution of sampling routes in unstructured environments. The platform integrates a behavior-tree autonomy architecture adapted from Nav2, enabling mission-level reasoning and perception-aware navigation. A modular 6x12 sampling system, controlled by distributed micro-ROS nodes, provides deterministic actuation, fault isolation, and rapid module replacement, achieving spatial coverage beyond previously reported USV-based samplers. Field trials in Achocalla Lagoon (La Paz, Bolivia) demonstrated 87% waypoint accuracy, stable autonomous navigation, and accurate physicochemical measurements (temperature, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids) comparable to manually collected references. These results demonstrate that the platform enables reliable high-resolution sampling and autonomous mission execution, providing a scalable solution for aquatic monitoring in remote environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u6c34\u9762\u8247\uff08USV\uff09\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u65b0\u578b\u6ce8\u5c04\u5668\u5f0f\u91c7\u6837\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u91c7\u96c672\u4e2a\u4f4e\u6c61\u67d3\u6c34\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408ROS 2\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6c34\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u81ea\u4e3b\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u6c34\u9762\u8247\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u70b9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6c34\u8d28\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u6b3e\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u5168\u81ea\u4e3bUSV\uff0c\u96c6\u6210ROS 2\u81ea\u4e3b\u6808\uff08\u542bGPS-RTK\u3001LiDAR\u4e0e\u53cc\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u907f\u969c\u3001Nav2\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u3001LoRa\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\uff09\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u6811\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u5faeROS\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u76846\u00d712\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6ce8\u5c04\u5668\u5f0f\u91c7\u6837\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73bb\u5229\u7ef4\u4e9a\u963f\u4e54\u5361\u62c9\u6e56\u5b9e\u5730\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fbe\u523087%\u822a\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u91c7\u6837\u57fa\u51c6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001pH\u3001\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u548c\u603b\u6eb6\u89e3\u56fa\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86USV\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u504f\u8fdc\u6c34\u57df\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u8d28\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose AgentComp, a framework that explicitly trains models to better differentiate such compositional variations and enhance their reasoning ability. AgentComp leverages the reasoning and tool-use capabilities of large language models equipped with image generation, editing, and VQA tools to autonomously construct compositional datasets. Using these datasets, we apply an agentic preference optimization method to fine-tune text-to-image models, enabling them to better distinguish between compositionally similar samples and resulting in overall stronger compositional generation ability.

Revisiting LLM Reliability in Hate Speech Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Hate speech spreads widely online, harming individuals and communities, making automatic detection essential for large-scale moderation, yet detecting it remains difficult. Part of the challenge lies in subjectivity: what one person flags as hate speech, another may see as benign. Traditional annotation agreement metrics, such as Cohen's $\u03ba$, oversimplify this disagreement, treating it as an error rather than meaningful diversity. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise scalable annotation, but prior studies demonstrate that they cannot fully replace human judgement, especially in subjective tasks. In this work, we reexamine LLM reliability using a subjectivity-aware framework, cross-Rater Reliability (xRR), revealing that even under fairer lens, LLMs still diverge from humans. Yet this limitation opens an opportunity: we find that LLM-generated annotations can reliably reflect performance trends across classification models, correlating with human evaluations. We test this by examining whether LLM-generated annotations preserve the relative ordering of model performance derived from human evaluation (i.e. whether models ranked as more reliable by human annotators preserve the same order when evaluated with LLM-generated labels). Our results show that, although LLMs differ from humans at the instance level, they reproduce similar ranking and classification patterns, suggesting their potential as proxy evaluators. While not a substitute for human annotators, they might serve as a scalable proxy for evaluation in subjective NLP tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6846\u67b6xRR\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u89c2NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Cohen's \u03ba\uff09\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u6b67\u7b80\u5355\u89c6\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800cLLM\u867d\u5177\u6807\u6ce8\u6f5c\u529b\u5374\u96be\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff1b\u9700\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8de8\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff08xRR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u6807\u6ce8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8cLLM\u751f\u6210\u6807\u7b7e\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u5f97\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u5373\u6392\u5e8f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "result": "LLM\u6807\u6ce8\u867d\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5c42\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2NLP\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4e2d\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Inspired by biological systems where structure and function emerge from low-energy configurations, we introduce StructuredDNA, a sparse architecture framework for modular, energy-aware Transformer routing. StructuredDNA replaces dense Mixture-of-Experts routing with a bio-physical, energy-guided routing layer based on semantic energy minimization. Inputs are dynamically grouped into semantic codons, and routing selects a single expert by minimizing a global energy functional that combines cohesion, uncertainty, and computational cost.\n  We validate StructuredDNA on both specialized (BioASQ) and open-domain benchmarks (WikiText-103). On BioASQ (K = 50), we achieve a 97.7% reduction in Energy Utilization Density (EUD) and a Semantic Stability Index (SSI) of 0.998. We further demonstrate a Semantic Scaling Law on WikiText-103, showing that the architecture generalizes to open domains by scaling expert granularity (K = 2048) while maintaining more than 99% energy efficiency. StructuredDNA thus establishes a robust, domain-agnostic paradigm for future sparse computational frameworks.\n  StructuredDNA provides an explicit link between bio-physical principles and sparse expert routing in Transformer architectures, and points toward future energy-aware, modular, and scalable computational systems. We discuss limitations of this proof-of-concept study and outline directions for scaling the approach to larger models, datasets, and hardware platforms.

To address this, we propose MDSE, Multimodal Disaster Situation Explainer, a novel vision-language framework that automatically generates detailed textual explanations of post-disaster underground scenes. MDSE has three-fold innovations: (i) Context-Aware Cross-Attention for robust alignment of visual and textual features even under severe degradation; (ii) Segmentation-aware dual pathway visual encoding that fuses global and region-specific embeddings; and (iii) Resource-Efficient Transformer-Based Language Model for expressive caption generation with minimal compute cost. To support this task, we present the Underground Mine Disaster (UMD) dataset--the first image-caption corpus of real underground disaster scenes--enabling rigorous training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on UMD and related benchmarks show that MDSE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art captioning models, producing more accurate and contextually relevant descriptions that capture crucial details in obscured environments, improving situational awareness for underground emergency response.

See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination.

For instance, the prompt \"egg noodle\" may result in images that incorrectly contain both eggs and noodles as separate entities. Multi-noun food categories are common in real-world datasets and account for a large portion of entries in benchmarks such as UEC-256. These compound names often cause generative models to misinterpret the semantics, producing unintended ingredients or objects. This is due to insufficient multi-noun category related knowledge in the text encoder and misinterpretation of multi-noun relationships, leading to incorrect spatial layouts.

Existing RL methods for dLLMs fall short in both aspects: they rely on coarse or unverifiable reward signals, and they estimate prediction probabilities without accounting for the bias relative to the true, unbiased expected prediction probability that properly integrates over all possible decoding orders. To mitigate these issues, we propose \\emph{d}-TreeRPO, a reliable RL framework for dLLMs that leverages tree-structured rollouts and bottom-up advantage computation based on verifiable outcome rewards to provide fine-grained and verifiable step-wise reward signals. When estimating the conditional transition probability from a parent node to a child node, we theoretically analyze the estimation error between the unbiased expected prediction probability and the estimate obtained via a single forward pass, and find that higher prediction confidence leads to lower estimation error.

Existing approaches typically encode camera trajectories through relative or ambiguous representations, limiting explicit geometric control. We introduce GimbalDiffusion, a framework that enables camera control grounded in physical-world coordinates, using gravity as a global reference. Instead of describing motion relative to previous frames, our method defines camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system, allowing precise and interpretable control over camera parameters without requiring an initial reference frame. We leverage panoramic 360-degree videos to construct a wide variety of camera trajectories, well beyond the predominantly straight, forward-facing trajectories seen in conventional video data. To further enhance camera guidance, we introduce null-pitch conditioning, an annotation strategy that reduces the model's reliance on text content when conflicting with camera specifications (e.g., generating grass while the camera points towards the sky). Finally, we establish a benchmark for camera-aware video generation by rebalancing SpatialVID-HQ for comprehensive evaluation under wide camera pitch variation. Together, these contributions advance the controllability and robustness of text-to-video models, enabling precise, gravity-aligned camera manipulation within generative frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGimbalDiffusion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u91cd\u529b\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408360\u5ea6\u5168\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u7acb\u652f\u6301\u5927\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u671d\u5411\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5176\u8f68\u8ff9\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGimbalDiffusion\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u91cd\u529b\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528360\u5ea6\u5168\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165null-pitch conditioning\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b4\uff09\u91cd\u6784SpatialVID-HQ\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u5bbd\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u521d\u59cb\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GimbalDiffusion\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u64cd\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Conventional computational fluid dynamics simulations provide accurate insights but are prohibitively slow and require specialized expertise. Clinical imaging alternatives such as 4D Flow MRI offer direct in-vivo measurements, yet their spatial resolution remains insufficient to capture the fine-scale shear patterns that drive endothelial remodeling and rupture risk while being extremely impractical and expensive.\n  We present a graph neural network surrogate model that bridges this gap by reproducing full-field hemodynamics directly from vascular geometries in less than one minute per cardiac cycle. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of high-fidelity simulations of patient-specific aneurysms, our architecture combines graph transformers with autoregressive predictions to accurately simulate blood flow, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index. The model generalizes across unseen patient geometries and inflow conditions without mesh-specific calibration. Beyond accelerating simulation, our framework establishes the foundation for clinically interpretable hemodynamic prediction. By enabling near real-time inference integrated with existing imaging pipelines, it allows direct comparison with hospital phase-diagram assessments and extends them with physically grounded, high-resolution flow fields.\n  This work transforms high-fidelity simulations from an expert-only research tool into a deployable, data-driven decision support system.

However, constructing and maintaining 3D maps is often computationally expensive and memory-intensive. We address the problem of visual navigation when exploration videos of a large environment are available. The videos serve as a visual reference, allowing a robot to retrace the explored trajectories without relying on metric maps. Our proposed method, YOPO-Nav (You Only Pass Once), encodes an environment into a compact spatial representation composed of interconnected local 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. During navigation, the framework aligns the robot's current visual observation with this representation and predicts actions that guide it back toward the demonstrated trajectory. YOPO-Nav employs a hierarchical design: a visual place recognition (VPR) module provides coarse localization, while the local 3DGS models refine the goal and intermediate poses to generate control actions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the YOPO-Campus dataset, comprising 4 hours of egocentric video and robot controller inputs from over 6 km of human-teleoperated robot trajectories. We benchmark recent visual navigation methods on trajectories from YOPO-Campus using a Clearpath Jackal robot. Experimental results show YOPO-Nav provides excellent performance in image-goal navigation for real-world scenes on a physical robot.

Such challenges occur in satellite remote sensing, but also with handheld cameras, such as our smartphones. Hence, super-resolution aims to enhance the image resolution algorithmically. Since single-image super-resolution requires solving an inverse problem, such methods must exploit strong priors, e.g. learned from high-resolution training data, or be constrained by auxiliary data, e.g. by a high-resolution guide from another modality. While qualitatively pleasing, such approaches often lead to \"hallucinated\" structures that do not match reality. In contrast, multi-image super-resolution (MISR) aims to improve the (optical) resolution by constraining the super-resolution process with multiple views taken with sub-pixel shifts. Here, we propose SuperF, a test-time optimization approach for MISR that leverages coordinate-based neural networks, also called neural fields. Their ability to represent continuous signals with an implicit neural representation (INR) makes them an ideal fit for the MISR task.\n  The key characteristic of our approach is to share an INR for multiple shifted low-resolution frames and to jointly optimize the frame alignment with the INR. Our approach advances related INR baselines, adopted from burst fusion for layer separation, by directly parameterizing the sub-pixel alignment as optimizable affine transformation parameters and by optimizing via a super-sampled coordinate grid that corresponds to the output resolution. Our experiments yield compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras, with upsampling factors of up to 8.

In this work, we propose novel isotonic normalization-aware techniques for multiclass calibration, grounded in natural and intuitive assumptions expected by practitioners. Unlike prior approaches, our methods inherently account for probability normalization by either incorporating normalization directly into the optimization process (NA-FIR) or modeling the problem as a cumulative bivariate isotonic regression (SCIR).

Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries.

Angiography derived indices such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) offer wire free physiology, yet many tools are workflow intensive and separate from automated anatomy analysis and virtual PCI planning. We developed AngioAI-QFR, an end to end angiography only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography derived QFR. The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045). The AUC for detecting FFR <= 0.80 was 0.93, with sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.86. The pipeline completed fully automatically in 93 percent of vessels, with median time to result 41 s.

But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. \"Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner\"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors.

Hill", "Efi Foufoula-Georgiou", "Clement Guilloteau", "Samuel S. P. Shen"], "title": "A Diffusion-Based Framework for High-Resolution Precipitation Forecasting over CONUS", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate precipitation forecasting is essential for hydrometeorological risk management, especially for anticipating extreme rainfall that can lead to flash flooding and infrastructure damage. This study introduces a diffusion-based deep learning (DL) framework that systematically compares three residual prediction strategies differing only in their input sources: (1) a fully data-driven model using only past observations from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, (2) a corrective model using only forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction system, and (3) a hybrid model integrating both MRMS and selected HRRR forecast variables. By evaluating these approaches under a unified setup, we provide a clearer understanding of how each data source contributes to predictive skill over the Continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts are produced at 1-km spatial resolution, beginning with direct 1-hour predictions and extending to 12 hours using autoregressive rollouts. Performance is evaluated using both CONUS-wide and region-specific metrics that assess overall performance and skill at extreme rainfall thresholds. Across all lead times, our DL framework consistently outperforms the HRRR baseline in pixel-wise and spatiostatistical metrics. The hybrid model performs best at the shortest lead time, while the HRRR-corrective model outperforms others at longer lead times, maintaining high skill through 12 hours.

Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.

Scott"], "title": "Contrast transfer functions help quantify neural network out-of-distribution generalization in HRTEM", "comment": null, "summary": "Neural networks, while effective for tackling many challenging scientific tasks, are not known to perform well out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., within domains which differ from their training data. Understanding neural network OOD generalization is paramount to their successful deployment in experimental workflows, especially when ground-truth knowledge about the experiment is hard to establish or experimental conditions significantly vary. With inherent access to ground-truth information and fine-grained control of underlying distributions, simulation-based data curation facilitates precise investigation of OOD generalization behavior. Here, we probe generalization with respect to imaging conditions of neural network segmentation models for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging of nanoparticles, training and measuring the OOD generalization of over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic data generated via random structure sampling and multislice simulation. Using the HRTEM contrast transfer function, we further develop a framework to compare information content of HRTEM datasets and quantify OOD domain shifts. We demonstrate that neural network segmentation models enjoy significant performance stability, but will smoothly and predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution.

However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models.

Advancements in the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating human-sounding text have greatly increased the amount of human-to-computer interaction. As this field grows, the cultural alignment of these human-like agents becomes an important field of study. Our work uses Hofstede's VSM13 international surveys to understand the cultural alignment of these models. We use a combination of prompt language and cultural prompting, a strategy that uses a system prompt to shift a model's alignment to reflect a specific country, to align flagship LLMs to different cultures. Our results show that DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, and OpenAI's GPT-5 exhibit a close alignment with the survey responses of the United States and do not achieve a strong or soft alignment with China, even when using cultural prompts or changing the prompt language. We also find that GPT-4 exhibits an alignment closer to China when prompted in English, but cultural prompting is effective in shifting this alignment closer to the United States.

However, most VLAs assume the Markov property, relying only on the current observation and thus suffering from temporal myopia that degrades long-horizon coherence. In this work, we view motion as a more compact and informative representation of temporal context and world dynamics, capturing inter-state changes while filtering static pixel-level noise. Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation.

Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on UT-Zappos and C-GQA benchmarks demonstrate that PromptCCZSL achieves substantial improvements over prior VLM-based and non-VLM baselines, setting a new benchmark for CCZSL in closed-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6301\u7eed\u7ec4\u5408\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CCZSL\uff09\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6PromptCCZSL\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u4f1a\u8bdd\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u951a\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u3001\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5185\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u7b49\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u9632\u6b62\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CZSL\uff09\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5047\u8bbe\u7c7b\u522b\u4e92\u65a5\uff0c\u800cCCZSL\u4e2d\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u590d\u7528\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u552f\u4e00\uff0c\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPromptCCZSL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3VLM\u4e3b\u5e72\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528recency-weighted\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u4fdd\u7559\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f1a\u8bdd\u611f\u77e5\u7ec4\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4\uff09\u5c5e\u6027/\u7269\u4f53\u63d0\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u4f1a\u8bdd\u65e0\u5173\u878d\u5408\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Cosine Anchor Loss\uff08CAL\uff09\u7a33\u5b9a\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b5\uff09Orthogonal Projection Loss\uff08OPL\uff09\u907f\u514d\u65b0\u65e7\u5d4c\u5165\u91cd\u53e0\uff1b6\uff09Intra-Session Diversity Loss\uff08IDL\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u5f53\u524d\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5185\u8868\u5f81\u5224\u522b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728UT-Zappos\u548cC-GQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709VLM\u53ca\u975eVLM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6811\u7acbCCZSL\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "PromptCCZSL\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3CCZSL\u4e2d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u534f\u540c\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

While Deep Learning (DL) and hybrid pipelines dominate recent research, their complexity and limited interpretability hinder operational use. This study investigates whether lightweight additive models -- Facebook Prophet (FBP) and NeuralProphet (NP) -- can deliver competitive forecasts for particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$) in Beijing, China. Using multi-year pollutant and meteorological data, we applied systematic feature selection (correlation, mutual information, mRMR), leakage-safe scaling, and chronological data splits. Both models were trained with pollutant and precursor regressors, with NP additionally leveraging lagged dependencies. For context, two machine learning baselines (LSTM, LightGBM) and one traditional statistical model (SARIMAX) were also implemented.

While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $\u0394$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $\u0394$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u0394-LFM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08Flow Matching\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u5355\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f7f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cbf\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e25\u91cd\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u75c5\u60c5\uff09\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8de8\u60a3\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u75be\u75c5\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u9f50\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u8f68\u8ff9\u6cbf\u7279\u5b9a\u8f74\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e25\u91cd\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7eb5\u5411MRI\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u0394-LFM\u7684\u5f3a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u0394-LFM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u7f3a\u5931\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

While recent implementations such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) demonstrate high approximation capabilities, they suffer from significant parameter inefficiency due to the requirement of maintaining unique parameterizations for every network edge. In this work, we propose GS-KAN (Generalized Sprecher-KAN), a lightweight architecture inspired by David Sprecher's refinement of the superposition theorem. GS-KAN constructs unique edge functions by applying learnable linear transformations to a single learnable, shared parent function per layer. We evaluate GS-KAN against existing KAN architectures and MLPs across synthetic function approximation, tabular data regression and image classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that GS-KAN outperforms both MLPs and standard KAN baselines on continuous function approximation tasks while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Additionally, GS-KAN achieves competitive performance with existing KAN architectures on tabular regression and outperforms MLPs on high-dimensional classification tasks.

Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684VLM x SI\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014View-on-Graph\uff08VoG\uff09\uff0c\u5c063D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5916\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u88ab\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u9010\u6b65\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c3D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff083DVG\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c3DVG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c063D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u52302D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u7ea0\u7f20\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faView-on-Graph\uff08VoG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7fVLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u56fe\u4e0a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bbf\u95ee\u5fc5\u8981\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "VoG\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c3DVG\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u573a\u666f\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c3DVG\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Previous approaches mainly target vision-language scenarios and focus on the explicit temporal grounding questions, such as identifying when a visual event occurs or determining what event happens at aspecific time. However, they often make insufficient use of the audio modality, and overlook implicit temporal grounding across modalities--for example, identifying what is visually present when a character speaks, or determining what is said when a visual event occurs--despite such cross-modal temporal relations being prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChronusOmni, an omni large language model designed to enhance temporal awareness for both explicit and implicit audiovisual temporal grounding. First, we interleave text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio representations at each time unit, enabling unified temporal modeling across modalities. Second, to enforce correct temporal ordering and strengthen fine-grained temporal reasoning, we incorporate reinforcement learning with specially designed reward functions. Moreover, we construct ChronusAV, a temporally-accurate, modality-complete, and cross-modal-aligned dataset to support the training and evaluation on audiovisual temporal grounding task. Experimental results demonstrate that ChronusOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance on ChronusAV with more than 30% improvement and top results on most metrics upon other temporal grounding benchmarks. This highlights the strong temporal awareness of our model across modalities, while preserving general video and audio understanding capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faChronusOmni\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u96c6ChronusAV\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u6001\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9690\u5f0f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u8bf4\u8bdd\u65f6\u523b\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5355\u5143\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u5f81\u4ea4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efaChronusAV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "result": "ChronusOmni\u5728ChronusAV\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d8530%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ChronusOmni\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5e8f\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We present a unified framework for certified robust attribution that extends from convex models to deep networks. For convex settings, we derive Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions (W-RIF) with provable coverage guarantees. For deep networks, we demonstrate that Euclidean certification is rendered vacuous by spectral amplification -- a mechanism where the inherent ill-conditioning of deep representations inflates Lipschitz bounds by over $10{,}000\\times$. This explains why standard TRAK scores, while accurate point estimates, are geometrically fragile: naive Euclidean robustness analysis yields 0\\% certification. Our key contribution is the Natural Wasserstein metric, which measures perturbations in the geometry induced by the model's own feature covariance. This eliminates spectral amplification, reducing worst-case sensitivity by $76\\times$ and stabilizing attribution estimates. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, Natural W-TRAK certifies 68.7\\% of ranking pairs compared to 0\\% for Euclidean baselines -- to our knowledge, the first non-vacuous certified bounds for neural network attribution.

Nowadays, event cameras are becoming more widely adopted as they surpass RGB cameras in capturing facial expression changes due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, computational efficiency, and robustness in low-light conditions. Despite these advantages, event-based approaches still encounter practical challenges, particularly in adopting mainstream deep learning models. Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CS3D method attains higher accuracy on multiple datasets compared to architectures such as the RNN, Transformer, and C3D, while the energy consumption of the CS3D method is just 21.97\\% of the original C3D required on the same device.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCS3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e33D\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u8f6f\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u867d\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5177\u9ad8\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u6d41\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCS3D\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5206\u89e3Conv3D\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6f\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCS3D\u76f8\u6bd4RNN\u3001Transformer\u548cC3D\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u4ec5\u4e3a\u539f\u59cbC3D\u768421.97%\u3002", "conclusion": "CS3D\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language. A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative. This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs. Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories. Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities. Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential. The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff08PRM\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u654f\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e76\u653e\u5927\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5355\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u3001PRM-Select\uff08Best-of-N\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u3001PRM-Sequential\uff08\u57fa\u4e8ePRM\u6279\u8bc4\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\uff09\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528GPT-3.5\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\uff0cGPT-4o-mini\u4f5c\u4e3aPRM\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u89c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u6253\u5206\uff1b\u5728200\u4e2a\u82f1/\u4e4c\u53cc\u8bed\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u8986\u76d68\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u654f\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\uff08a\uff09\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\uff08b\uff09\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff1b\uff08c\uff09PRM-Select\u4e0ePRM-Sequential\u5448\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5728\u590d\u6742\u504f\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u65f6PRM\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u89c1\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u51f8\u663e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u516c\u5e73\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths. However, we also observe that their performance degrades when applied to out-of-domain data, and that fine-grained tuning of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off can be challenging with our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a9\u7801\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u53ca\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u96be\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u6cd5\uff09\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5927\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0cdLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5c42Transformer\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4e3adLLM\u5404token\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u4e3a\u5f85unmask\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u534a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u6269\u6563\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5177\u5907\u8de8dLLM\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u66f4\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u8c03\u63a7\u8f83\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u662f\u66ff\u4ee3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models.

To examine the efficacy of our method, the proposed method is integrated into the latest Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) codec standard under development by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG).

Finally, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a novel gradient-based regularization strategy specifically designed for low-rank decomposition matrices.

However, the standard trunk design based on fully connected layers acting on raw spatial or spatiotemporal coordinates struggles to represent sharp gradients, boundary layers, and non-periodic structures commonly found in PDEs posed on bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Spectral-Embedded DeepONet (SEDONet), a new DeepONet variant in which the trunk is driven by a fixed Chebyshev spectral dictionary rather than coordinate inputs. This non-periodic spectral embedding provides a principled inductive bias tailored to bounded domains, enabling the learned operator to capture fine-scale non-periodic features that are difficult for Fourier or MLP trunks to represent. SEDONet is evaluated on a suite of PDE benchmarks including 2D Poisson, 1D Burgers, 1D advection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn dynamics, and the Lorenz-96 chaotic system, covering elliptic, parabolic, advective, and multiscale temporal phenomena, all of which can be viewed as canonical problems in computational mechanics. Across all datasets, SEDONet consistently achieves the lowest relative L2 errors among DeepONet, FEDONet, and SEDONet, with average improvements of about 30-40% over the baseline DeepONet and meaningful gains over Fourier-embedded variants on non-periodic geometries. Spectral analyses further show that SEDONet more accurately preserves high-frequency and boundary-localized features, demonstrating the value of Chebyshev embeddings in non-periodic operator learning. The proposed architecture offers a simple, parameter-neutral modification to DeepONets, delivering a robust and efficient spectral framework for surrogate modeling of PDEs on bounded domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpectral-Embedded DeepONet\uff08SEDONet\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06DeepONet\u7684trunk\u8f93\u5165\u7531\u539f\u59cb\u5750\u6807\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9aChebyshev\u8c31\u5b57\u5178\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5bf9\u975e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u548c\u5c16\u9510\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cdPDE\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6DeepONet\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5d4c\u5165\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6DeepONet\u7684trunk\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4/\u65f6\u7a7a\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u6709\u754c\u57df\u4e0a\u5e26Dirichlet\u6216Neumann\u8fb9\u754c\u7684PDE\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u548c\u975e\u5468\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSEDONet\uff0c\u5728trunk\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684Chebyshev\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u59cb\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u9002\u914d\u7684\u975e\u5468\u671f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff1b\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57282D Poisson\u30011D Burgers\u30011D\u5bf9\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u3001Allen-Cahn\u548cLorenz-96\u7b49PDE\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSEDONet\u76f8\u5bf9L2\u8bef\u5dee\u6301\u7eed\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6DeepONet\u4f4e30\u201340%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u975e\u5468\u671f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5d4c\u5165\u53d8\u4f53\uff1b\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u5c40\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "SEDONet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u7acb\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u7684DeepONet\u6539\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u754c\u57dfPDE\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While they have shown to work exceptionally well, they are not without issues, resulting in surprising failure modes and predictably asymmetric performance degradation. This article is a study of many of these observed failure modes of transformers through the lens of graph neural network (GNN) theory. We first make the case that much of deep learning, including transformers, is about learnable information mixing and propagation. This makes the study of model failure modes a study of bottlenecks in information propagation. This naturally leads to GNN theory, where there is already a rich literature on information propagation bottlenecks and theoretical failure modes of models. We then make the case that many issues faced by GNNs are also experienced by transformers. In addition, we analyze how the causal nature of decoder-only transformers create interesting geometric properties in information propagation, resulting in predictable and potentially devastating failure modes. Finally, we observe that existing solutions in transformer research tend to be ad-hoc and driven by intuition rather than grounded theoretical motivation. As such, we unify many such solutions under a more theoretical perspective, providing insight into why they work, what problem they are actually solving, and how they can be further improved to target specific failure modes of transformers. Overall, this article is an attempt to bridge the gap between observed failure modes in transformers and a general lack of theoretical understanding of them in this space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790decoder-only Transformer\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u7edf\u4e00\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u867d\u6210\u529f\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u5931\u6548\u673a\u7406\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u800cGNN\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u74f6\u9888\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u6709\u6df1\u539a\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u5931\u6548\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u6df7\u5408\u4e0e\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7c7b\u6bd4GNN\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790Transformer\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdfdecoder-only\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u8be0\u91ca\u73b0\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982RoPE\u3001ALiBi\u3001FlashAttention\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u7531\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u53d7\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u65ad\u88c2\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u574d\u7f29\u7b49\uff09\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u2018\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u9525\u2019\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u5c06\u82e5\u5e72\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6280\u5de7\u7eb3\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u5176\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u74f6\u9888\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u88ab\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u74f6\u9888\uff0cGNN\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u5176\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5e94\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8c03\u4f18\uff1b\u8be5\u6865\u6881\u5de5\u4f5c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We propose OmniPSD, a unified diffusion framework built upon the Flux ecosystem that enables both text-to-PSD generation and image-to-PSD decomposition through in-context learning. For text-to-PSD generation, OmniPSD arranges multiple target layers spatially into a single canvas and learns their compositional relationships through spatial attention, producing semantically coherent and hierarchically structured layers. For image-to-PSD decomposition, it performs iterative in-context editing, progressively extracting and erasing textual and foreground components to reconstruct editable PSD layers from a single flattened image. An RGBA-VAE is employed as an auxiliary representation module to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning.

Multiple transcatheter heart valves (THV) have been approved for use in TAVR, but current guidelines regarding valve type prescription remain an active topic of debate. We propose a data-driven clinical support tool to identify the optimal valve type with the objective of minimizing the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), a predominant postoperative complication. We synthesize a novel dataset that combines U.S. and Greek patient populations and integrates three distinct data sources (patient demographics, computed tomography scans, echocardiograms) while harmonizing differences in each country's record system. We introduce a leaf-level analysis to leverage population heterogeneity and avoid benchmarking against uncertain counterfactual risk estimates. The final prescriptive model shows a reduction in PPI rates of 26% and 16% compared with the current standard of care in our internal U.S. population and external Greek validation cohort, respectively.

However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\\textbf{G}lacial \\textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \\textbf{C}ontextual \\textbf{I}nstance \\textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66). Our approach enables intuitive disaster preparedness and informed policy-making in the context of rapidly changing glacial environments by facilitating natural language interaction, thereby supporting more efficient and interpretable decision-making.

Single-Call LLM Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning over both structured and unstructured knowledge. When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability. These results indicate that carefully designed HDC representations provide a practical substrate for efficient KG-LLM reasoning, offering a favorable accuracy-efficiency-interpretability trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "PathHD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08HDC\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u8def\u5f84\u6253\u5206\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KG\uff09\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6216\u591a\u6b21LLM\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9ad8GPU\u5f00\u9500\u53ca\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPathHD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2GHRR\u8d85\u5411\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u5173\u7cfb\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0eTop-K\u526a\u679d\u8fdb\u884c\u5019\u9009\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u4ee5\u5355\u6b21LLM\u8c03\u7528\u5b8c\u6210\u5224\u51b3\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u652f\u6491\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(i) \u6709\u5e8f\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7b97\u5b50\u3001(ii) \u6821\u51c6\u7684\u8d85\u5411\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001(iii) \u5355\u6b21\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5224\u51b3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728WebQSP\u3001CWQ\u548cGrailQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPathHD\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5f3a\u795e\u7ecf\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684Hits@1\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21LLM\u8c03\u7528\uff1b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e40\u201360%\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c113\u20135\u500d\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u8def\u5f84\u652f\u6491\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9519\u8bef\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8d85\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u5f81\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548KG-LLM\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the applicability and consistency of LLMs for analog circuit design -- a task requiring domain-specific reasoning, adherence to physical constraints, and structured representations -- focusing on AI-assisted design where humans remain in the loop. We study how different data representations influence model behavior and compare smaller models (e.g., T5, GPT-2) with larger foundation models (e.g., Mistral-7B, GPT-oss-20B) under varying training conditions. Our results highlight key reliability challenges, including sensitivity to data format, instability in generated designs, and limited generalization to unseen circuit configurations.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient.

However, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is hindered by substantial computational and memory overhead, primarily stemming from higher-order automatic differentiation, intensive tensor operations, and reliance on full-precision arithmetic. To address these challenges, we present a framework that enables scalable and energy-efficient PINN training on edge devices. This framework integrates fully quantized training, Stein's estimator (SE)-based residual loss computation, and tensor-train (TT) decomposition for weight compression. It contributes three key innovations: (1) a mixed-precision training method that use a square-block MX (SMX) format to eliminate data duplication during backpropagation; (2) a difference-based quantization scheme for the Stein's estimator that mitigates underflow; and (3) a partial-reconstruction scheme (PRS) for TT-Layers that reduces quantization-error accumulation. We further design PINTA, a precision-scalable hardware accelerator, to fully exploit the performance of the framework. Experiments on the 2-D Poisson, 20-D Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB), and 100-D Heat equations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision, uncompressed baselines while delivering 5.5x to 83.5x speedups and 159.6x to 2324.1x energy savings.

However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMoRel\u7684\u65b0\u578b4D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending\uff08ARBB\uff09\u673a\u5236\u548cFeature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification\uff08FHD\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u65e0\u95ea\u70c1\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u542b\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u95ea\u70c1\u53ca\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0/\u6d88\u5931\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6df7\u5408\uff08ARBB\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u951a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u951a\u70b9\u7ea7\u5e27\u95f4\u5f62\u53d8\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u5411\u5f62\u53d8\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7a20\u5bc6\u5316\uff08FHD\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u951a\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u65e0\u95ea\u70c1\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u957f\u7a0b4D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MoRel\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e864D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u5f81\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the \"right to be forgotten\". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction.

However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical verification through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that our method can surpass existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep regression methods.

However, the existing T2I alignment benchmarks predominantly focus on short prompt scenarios and only provide MOS or Likert scale annotations. This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models.

We develop a multimodal facial expression analysis network to extract expression intensity features during patients' performance of various facial expressions. This network leverages the CLIP architecture to integrate visual and textual features while preserving the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Subsequently, the expression intensity features are processed and input into an LSTM-based classification network for PD diagnosis.

Accepted at MCSoC 2025", "summary": "The continuous scaling of deep neural networks has fundamentally transformed machine learning, with larger models demonstrating improved performance across diverse tasks. This growth in model size has dramatically increased the computational resources required for the training process. Consequently, distributed approaches, such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, have become essential paradigms for scalable deployment. However, existing Split Learning approaches assume client homogeneity and uniform split points across all participants. This critically limits their applicability to real-world IoT systems where devices exhibit heterogeneity in computational resources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Hetero-SplitEE, a novel method that enables heterogeneous IoT devices to train a shared deep neural network in parallel collaboratively. By integrating heterogeneous early exits into hierarchical training, our approach allows each client to select distinct split points (cut layers) tailored to its computational capacity. In addition, we propose two cooperative training strategies, the Sequential strategy and the Averaging strategy, to facilitate this collaboration among clients with different split points. The Sequential strategy trains clients sequentially with a shared server model to reduce computational overhead. The Averaging strategy enables parallel client training with periodic cross-layer aggregation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets using ResNet-18 demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while efficiently supporting diverse computational constraints, enabling practical deployment of collaborative deep learning in heterogeneous IoT ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHetero-SplitEE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784IoT\u8bbe\u5907\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5171\u4eab\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5f02\u6784\u65e9\u9000\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u987a\u5e8f\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Split Learning\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u540c\u8d28\u4e14\u5207\u5206\u70b9\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u771f\u5b9eIoT\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHetero-SplitEE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u8eab\u7b97\u529b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u5206\u70b9\uff08cut layers\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1Sequential\u548cAveraging\u4e24\u79cd\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u524d\u8005\u987a\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8de8\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u548cSTL-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u57fa\u4e8eResNet-18\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "Hetero-SplitEE\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784IoT\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360\u00b0 scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model.

The acquired representations from SSL have demonstrated useful for many downstream tasks including clustering, and linear classification, etc. To ensure smoothness of the representation space, most SSL methods rely on the ability to generate pairs of observations that are similar to a given instance. However, generating these pairs may be challenging for many types of data. Moreover, these methods lack consideration of uncertainty quantification and can perform poorly in out-of-sample prediction settings. To address these limitations, we propose Gaussian process self supervised learning (GPSSL), a novel approach that utilizes Gaussian processes (GP) models on representation learning. GP priors are imposed on the representations, and we obtain a generalized Bayesian posterior minimizing a loss function that encourages informative representations. The covariance function inherent in GPs naturally pulls representations of similar units together, serving as an alternative to using explicitly defined positive samples. We show that GPSSL is closely related to both kernel PCA and VICReg, a popular neural network-based SSL method, but unlike both allows for posterior uncertainties that can be propagated to downstream tasks. Experiments on various datasets, considering classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that GPSSL outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and error control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GPSSL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u65bd\u52a0\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u51fd\u6570\u9690\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u7136\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6784\u9020\u76f8\u4f3c\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGPSSL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e7f\u4e49\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u517c\u987e\u8868\u5f81\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4e0e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u51fd\u6570\u81ea\u52a8\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u6837\u672c\u8868\u5f81\u62c9\u8fd1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cGPSSL\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfSSL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982VICReg\uff09\u548c\u6838PCA\u3002", "conclusion": "GPSSL\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u5907\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86SSL\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose a high-capacity diffusion-based image restoration foundation model, FoundIR-v2, which adopts a data equilibrium scheduling paradigm to dynamically optimize the proportions of mixed training datasets from different tasks. By leveraging the data mixing law, our method ensures a balanced dataset composition, enabling the model to achieve consistent generalization and comprehensive performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an effective Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven scheduler into generative pre-training to flexibly allocate task-adaptive diffusion priors for each restoration task, accounting for the distinct degradation forms and levels exhibited by different tasks.

This is in part because high-quality annotated data are far more difficult to obtain for proteins than for natural language. We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family. The supervised fine-tuned model generates sequences that are not only more novel but also display improved characteristics across both targeted design constraints and emergent protein property measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08PLM\uff09\u5feb\u901f\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528PLM\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7b5b\u9009\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u86cb\u767d\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u8fdc\u6bd4\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96be\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709PLM\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528SFT\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5229\u7528PLM\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff08\u5982\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u7eedSFT\uff1b\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u7f16\u8bd1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728GenSLM\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8272\u6c28\u9178\u5408\u9176\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u9896\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9776\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u86cb\u767d\u6027\u8d28\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662fPLM\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u62d3\u5c55\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u86cb\u767d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We present MelanomaNet, an explainable deep learning system for multi-class skin lesion classification that addresses this gap through four complementary interpretability mechanisms. Our approach combines an EfficientNet V2 backbone with GradCAM++ attention visualization, automated ABCDE clinical criterion extraction, Fast Concept Activation Vectors (FastCAV) for concept-based explanations, and Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty quantification. We evaluate our system on the ISIC 2019 dataset containing 25,331 dermoscopic images across 9 diagnostic categories. Our model achieves 85.61% accuracy with a weighted F1 score of 0.8564, while providing clinically meaningful explanations that align model attention with established dermatological assessment criteria. The uncertainty quantification module decomposes prediction confidence into epistemic and aleatoric components, enabling automatic flagging of unreliable predictions for clinical review. Our results demonstrate that high classification performance can be achieved alongside comprehensive interpretability, potentially facilitating greater trust and adoption in clinical dermatology workflows.

Code available at https://github.com/SonghanWu/yolov8n-SPTS", "summary": "This paper focuses on the key issue in autonomous driving: small target recognition in dynamic perception. Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency.

While standard Message-Passing GNNs (MPNNs) are efficient, they theoretically lack the expressive power to fully represent MILP structures. Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08MILP\uff09\u5206\u652f\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b50\u56feGNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6298\u4e2d\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u8282\u70b9\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u5b50\u56feGNN\uff08\u4f4e\u4e8e3-WL\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff09\u8db3\u4ee5\u903c\u8fd1\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6c42\u89e3\u66f4\u6162\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u529bGNN\u7684\u4ee3\u4ef7\u8d85\u8fc7\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012GNN\uff08MPNN\uff09\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6574\u5efa\u6a21MILP\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u9ad8\u9636GNN\uff08\u59822-FGNN\uff09\u867d\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5f3a\u5374\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u951a\u5b9a\u7684\u5b50\u56feGNN\uff08node-anchored Subgraph GNN\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u4e25\u683c\u5f31\u4e8e3-WL\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u8db3\u4ee5\u903c\u8fd1\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\uff08Strong Branching\uff09\u5f97\u5206\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4e0eMPNN\u53ca\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3001\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5206\u652f\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u8282\u70b9\u951a\u5b9a\u5b50\u56feGNN\uff08\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4f4e\u4e8e3-WL\uff09\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u903c\u8fd1\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\u5f97\u5206\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u652f\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5176O(n)\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u66f4\u957f\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u900a\u4e8eMPNN\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728MILP\u5206\u652f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u529bGNN\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u8d85\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6536\u76ca\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301MPNN\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u5373\u2018\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u2019\u3002"}}

These dimensions specifically assess pairwise similarities (text-video, text-audio, video-audio), audio-video synchronization, lip-speech consistency, and carefully curated audio and video question-answering (QA) pairs, among others. Furthermore, VABench covers seven major content categories: animals, human sounds, music, environmental sounds, synchronous physical sounds, complex scenes, and virtual worlds.

This study develops a forecasting framework that leverages the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) MasterFormat as the target data structure, enabling predictions at the six-digit section level and supporting detailed cost projections across a wide spectrum of building materials. To enhance predictive accuracy, the framework integrates explanatory variables such as raw material prices, commodity indexes, and macroeconomic indicators. Four time-series models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Chronos-Bolt, were evaluated under both baseline configurations (using CSI data only) and extended versions with explanatory variables. Results demonstrate that incorporating explanatory variables significantly improves predictive performance across all models.

While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability. Extensive experiments are performed across five benchmark datasets, such as Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, ColonDB, and CVC-300. Notably, Polyp-DiFoM consistently outperforms respective baseline models significantly, as well as the state-of-the-art model, with nearly 9 times reduced computation overhead.

However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions. Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions.

Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains.

LNMBench encompasses \\textbf{10} representative methods evaluated across 7 datasets, 6 imaging modalities, and 3 noise patterns, establishing a unified and reproducible framework for robustness evaluation under realistic conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the performance of existing LNL methods degrades substantially under high and real-world noise, highlighting the persistent challenges of class imbalance and domain variability in medical data. Motivated by these findings, we further propose a simple yet effective improvement to enhance model robustness under such conditions.

However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy. More importantly, it delivers up to 44.1\\% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions.

This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples.

Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have been employed to reconstruct the avatars. However, they often produce unsatisfactory photo-realistic results because of insufficient geometrical details related to body motion, such as clothing wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues. Furthermore, we present a new multi-view dataset with varied lighting conditions to evaluate relight. Our framework enables realistic rendering of novel poses and views while supporting photo-realistic lighting effects under arbitrary lighting conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, novel pose rendering, and relighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6RnD-Avatar\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8499\u76ae\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u65b0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u59ff\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u5982\u8863\u7269\u8936\u76b1\uff09\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u591a\u5149\u7167\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u3001\u65b0\u59ff\u6001\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u548c3DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3001\u53ef\u9a71\u52a8\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u8eab\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u5982\u670d\u88c5\u8936\u76b1\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRnD-Avatar\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e3DGS\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u7840\u8868\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u76ae\u80a4\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u59ff\u6001\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f62\u53d8\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5f62\u53d8\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u4ee5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\uff1b4\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u542b\u591a\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u3001\u65b0\u59ff\u6001\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff08SOTA\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u5149\u7167\u4e0b\u7684\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "RnD-Avatar\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u5149\u7167\u89e3\u8026\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3001\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The source code has been released at: https://github.com/qiongwu86/Federated-Distillation-Assisted-Vehicle-Edge-Caching-Scheme-Based-on-Lightweight-DDPM", "summary": "Vehicle edge caching is a promising technology that can significantly reduce the latency for vehicle users (VUs) to access content by pre-caching user-interested content at edge nodes. It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead.

To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM).

Prior work on model extraction has focused on classification models or memorization leakage, leaving the vulnerability of safety-aligned generative medical LLMs underexplored.\n  We present a black-box distillation attack that replicates the domain-specific reasoning of safety-aligned medical LLMs using only output-level access. By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks. We also propose a layered defense system, as a prototype detector for real-time alignment drift in black-box deployments.\n  Our findings show that benign-only black-box distillation exposes a practical and under-recognized threat: adversaries can cheaply replicate medical LLM capabilities while stripping safety mechanisms, underscoring the need for extraction-aware safety monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u84b8\u998f\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u51fa\u8bbf\u95ee\u5373\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u5176\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e25\u91cd\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u5ec9\uff0812\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u826f\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f86%\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u9ed1\u76d2\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u533b\u7597\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u800c\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9ed1\u76d2\u84b8\u998f\u653b\u51fb\uff1a\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5411Meditron-7B\u53d1\u900148,000\u6761\u6307\u4ee4\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u6536\u96c625,000\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u7684\u6307\u4ee4-\u54cd\u5e94\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03LLaMA3-8B\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u542bGQ\u6709\u5bb3\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u6790\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22 jailbreak \u653b\u51fb\uff09\u53ca\u5206\u5c42\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u82b1\u8d3912\u7f8e\u5143\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u826f\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8fbe86%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbMeditron-7B\uff0866%\uff09\u548c\u672a\u8c03\u4f18\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\uff0846%\uff09\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u2018\u529f\u80fd-\u4f26\u7406\u9e3f\u6c9f\u2019\u2014\u2014\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u826f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u84b8\u998f\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u4e14\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u590d\u73b0\u533b\u7597LLM\u80fd\u529b\u5374\u5265\u79bb\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u9762\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Our framework jointly conditions the model on the monocular video input while explicitly supervising the generation with a geometry-aware regularization to ensure 3D structural fidelity. A spatio-temporal tiling scheme is further integrated to enable efficient, high-resolution synthesis. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate a high-definition stereo video dataset containing over 11M frames aligned to natural human interpupillary distance (IPD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoWorld substantially outperforms prior methods, generating stereo videos with superior visual fidelity and geometric consistency.

However, existing regularizers are built on heterogeneous distance measures and design choices, which makes their behavior hard to reason about and their performance inconsistent across tasks. This raises a basic question: what properties make a good fairness regularizer? We address this question by first organizing existing in-process methods into three families: (i) matching prediction statistics across sensitive groups, (ii) aligning latent representations, and (iii) directly minimizing dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes. Through this lens, we identify desirable properties of the underlying distance measure, including tight generalization bounds, robustness to scale differences, and the ability to handle arbitrary prediction distributions. Motivated by these properties, we propose a Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) fairness regularizer that penalizes the empirical CS divergence between prediction distributions conditioned on sensitive groups. Under a Gaussian comparison, we show that CS divergence yields a tighter bound than Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and the mean disparity used in Demographic Parity, and we discuss how these advantages translate to a distribution-free, kernel-based estimator that naturally extends to multiple sensitive attributes. Extensive experiments on four tabular benchmarks and one image dataset demonstrate that the proposed CS regularizer consistently improves Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy, and achieves a more stable utility-fairness trade-off across hyperparameter settings compared to prior regularizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCauchy-Schwarz\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff08CS\u6b63\u5219\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u53e3\u5747\u7b49\u3001\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7d27\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u4f18\u826f\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u660e\u786e\u2018\u597d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5668\u2019\u5e94\u5177\u5907\u54ea\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u73b0\u6709in-process\u516c\u5e73\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff08\u5339\u914d\u9884\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u9690\u8868\u793a\u3001\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u70bc\u7406\u60f3\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u7d27\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8cCauchy-Schwarz\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "CS\u6b63\u5219\u5668\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u53e3\u5747\u7b49\uff08Demographic Parity\uff09\u548c\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\uff08Equal Opportunity\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6548\u7528-\u516c\u5e73\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "Cauchy-Schwarz\u6563\u5ea6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CS\u6b63\u5219\u5668\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Current methods struggle with generalization due to the scarce annotated 3D scene data or noisy 2D segmentations. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solution, existing 3D scene synthesis methods fail to simultaneously satisfy geometry diversity, context complexity, and layout reasonability, each essential for this task. To address these needs, we propose an Adapted 3D Scene Synthesis pipeline for class-agnostic 3D Instance SegmenTation, termed as ASSIST-3D, to synthesize proper data for model generalization enhancement. Specifically, ASSIST-3D features three key innovations, including 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection from extensive 3D CAD asset collections, incorporating randomness in object sampling to maximize geometric and contextual diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation through LLM-guided spatial reasoning combined with depth-first search for reasonable object placements; and 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D image rendering and fusion from the synthetic scenes, closely mimicking real-world sensor data acquisition. Experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with ASSIST-3D-generated data significantly outperform existing methods. Further comparisons underscore the superiority of our purpose-built pipeline over existing 3D scene synthesis approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aASSIST-3D\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e943D\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7c7b\u522b\u4f9d\u8d56\u76843D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u7269\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB-D\u70b9\u4e91\u91cd\u5efa\u4e09\u5927\u521b\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u771f\u5b9e3D\u573a\u666f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u62162D\u5206\u5272\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u800c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff1b\u73b0\u67093D\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u51e0\u4f55\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u5408\u7406\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faASSIST-3D\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D CAD\u5e93\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u5f02\u6784\u7269\u4f53\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u573a\u666f\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB-D\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u903c\u771f\u70b9\u4e91\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScanNetV2\u3001ScanNet++\u548cS3DIS\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ASSIST-3D\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed63D\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ASSIST-3D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u65e0\u7c7b\u522b\u4f9d\u8d563D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Standard practice assumes that balancing subgroup representation optimises performance. However, recent empirical results contradict this assumption: in some cases, imbalanced data distributions actually improve subgroup performance, while in others, subgroup performance remains unaffected by the absence of an entire subgroup during training. We conduct a systematic study of subgroup allocation across four vision and language models, varying training data composition to characterise the sensitivity of subgroup performance to data balance. We propose the latent separation hypothesis, which states that a partially fine-tuned model's dependence on subgroup representation is determined by the degree of separation between subgroups in the latent space of the pre-trained model. We formalise this hypothesis, provide theoretical analysis, and validate it empirically. Finally, we present a practical application to foundation model fine-tuning, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of latent subgroup separation can inform data collection and balancing decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b50\u7ec4\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u2018\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u5047\u8bf4\u2019\uff1a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b50\u7ec4\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5b50\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u505a\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u5e73\u8861\u5404\u5b50\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u671f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6b64\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4f5c\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7a76\u5b50\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u6210\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u5b50\u7ec4\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u2018\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u5047\u8bf4\u2019\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u5047\u8bf4\uff1a\u5b50\u7ec4\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5bf9\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b50\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u8d8a\u4f4e\uff1b\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b50\u7ec4\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u968f\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5176\u5173\u952e\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b50\u7ec4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff1b\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e73\u8861\u6765\u5236\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This paper proposes FUSER, the first feed-forward multiview registration transformer that jointly processes all scans in a unified, compact latent space to directly predict global poses without any pairwise estimation. To maintain tractability, FUSER encodes each scan into low-resolution superpoint features via a sparse 3D CNN that preserves absolute translation cues, and performs efficient intra- and inter-scan reasoning through a Geometric Alternating Attention module. Particularly, we transfer 2D attention priors from off-the-shelf foundation models to enhance 3D feature interaction and geometric consistency. Building upon FUSER, we further introduce FUSER-DF, an SE(3)$^N$ diffusion refinement framework to correct FUSER's estimates via denoising in the joint SE(3)$^N$ space. FUSER acts as a surrogate multiview registration model to construct the denoiser, and a prior-conditioned SE(3)$^N$ variational lower bound is derived for denoising supervision.

However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728log RGB\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3NeRF\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4sRGB\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u7b49\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u5149\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4f4d\u6df1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u591a\u57fa\u4e8esRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff1b\u53d7BIDR\u6a21\u578b\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbelog RGB\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u5206\u79bb\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u53cd\u5c04\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u96c6\u7ea630\u6bb5GoPro\u89c6\u9891\u5e76\u9006\u7f16\u7801\u6062\u590d\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5728linear\u3001sRGB\u3001GPLog\u548clog RGB\u56db\u79cd\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3NeRF\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6e32\u67d3\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "log RGB\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347PSNR/SSIM\u7b49\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6539\u5584\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u8be5\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u548cNeRF\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u5747\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "log RGB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4f18\u7684NeRF\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u989c\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Currently, sRGB-based WB editing for post-ISP WB correction is widely used to address color constancy failures in the ISP pipeline when the original camera RAW is unavailable. However, additive color models (e.g., sRGB) are inherently limited by fixed nonlinear transformations and entangled color channels, which often impede their generalization to complex lighting conditions.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for WB correction that leverages a perception-inspired Learnable HSI (LHSI) color space. Built upon a cylindrical color model that naturally separates luminance from chromatic components, our framework further introduces dedicated parameters to enhance this disentanglement and learnable mapping to adaptively refine the flexibility. Moreover, a new Mamba-based network is introduced, which is tailored to the characteristics of the proposed LHSI color space.\n  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the potential of perception-inspired color space design in computational photography.

Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical emergency, with increasing incidence in aging populations. Rapid and accurate identification is essential to guide timely intervention, yet existing automated tools focus primarily on detection and provide limited interpretability or spatial localization. There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making.\n  Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors.\n  Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926). The multimodal ensemble integrating all components achieved the best overall performance (AUC 0.9407; 95\\% CI, 0.930--0.951) and produced anatomically meaningful localization maps consistent with known SDH patterns.\n  Interpretation. This multimodal, interpretable framework provides rapid and accurate SDH detection and localization, achieving high detection performance and offering transparent, anatomically grounded outputs. Integration into radiology workflows could streamline triage, reduce time to intervention, and improve consistency in SDH management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e0eCT\u5f71\u50cf\uff083D CNN\u548cTransformer\u589e\u5f3a\u76842D\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u786c\u819c\u4e0b\u8840\u80bf\uff08SDH\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89e3\u5256\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0cAUC\u8fbe0.9407\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u4e3b\u8981\u805a\u7126\u4e8eSDH\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0e\u5f71\u50cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\u30013D CNN\u5904\u7406CT\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u3001Transformer\u589e\u5f3a\u76842D\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u878d\u5408\u5404\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u572825,315\u4f8b\u5934\u9885CT\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578bAUC\u8fbe0.9407\uff0895% CI: 0.930\u20130.951\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\uff08AUC 0.75\uff09\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08AUC ~0.925\uff09\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56fe\u7b26\u5408\u5df2\u77e5SDH\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4dSDH\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5d4c\u5165\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u8bca\u3001\u7f29\u77ed\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u7ba1\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

However, progress in sleep foundation models is hindered by two key limitations: (1) the lack of a shared dataset and benchmark with diverse tasks for training and evaluation, and (2) the absence of a systematic evaluation of SSRL approaches across sleep-related tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. However, for mortality and disease prediction, contrastive learning significantly outperforms other approaches while also converging faster during pretraining.

Our key idea is to generate cross-view consistent image pairs that are well-aligned with the source and target point clouds, enabling geometry-color feature fusion to facilitate robust matching. To ensure high-quality matching, the generated image pair should feature both 2D-3D geometric consistency and cross-view texture consistency. To achieve this, we introduce Match-ControlNet, a matching-specific, controllable 2D generative model. Specifically, it leverages the depth-conditioned generation capability of ControlNet to produce images that are geometrically aligned with depth maps derived from point clouds, ensuring 2D-3D geometric consistency. Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, Match-ControlNet further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation.

This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training. Our results suggest DI as a promising direction for copyright protection and dataset accountability in the era of large audio generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a8\u65ad\uff08DI\uff09\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u4f5c\u54c1\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DI\u6bd4\u5355\u6837\u672c\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u53d7\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7279\u5b9a\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u7248\u6743\u6301\u6709\u8005\u6743\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIA\uff09\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a8\u65ad\uff08DI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30DI\u5728\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u97f3\u9891\u6837\u672c\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6837\u672cMIA\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u800cDI\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5224\u65ad\u67d0\u4f4d\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u7684\u591a\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u662f\u5426\u6574\u4f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a8\u65ad\uff08DI\uff09\u662f\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Motion- and Expression-Aware Reconstruction (MEAR) loss, which reweights the diffusion loss per pixel using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity, thereby enhancing cross-frame coherence in motion and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectSwap achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, identity fidelity, and motion and expression consistency across diverse in-the-wild video scenes.

However, their expressive power remains not well understood. Focusing on 2-layer ReLU networks, this paper investigates the impact of equivariance constraints on the expressivity of equivariant and layer-wise equivariant networks. By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power. However, we demonstrate that this drawback can be compensated via enlarging the model size.

To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields.

However, existing agents are typically confined to static, predefined action spaces--such as exclusively using APIs, GUI events, or robotic commands. This rigidity limits their adaptability in dynamic environments where the optimal granularity of interaction varies contextually. To bridge this gap, we propose CrossAgent, a unified agentic model that masters heterogeneous action spaces and autonomously selects the most effective interface for each step of a trajectory. We introduce a comprehensive training pipeline that integrates cold-start supervised fine-tuning with a Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn adaptive action switching--balancing high-level efficiency with low-level precision--without human-specified rules. Extensive experiments on over 800 tasks in the open-world Minecraft environment demonstrate that CrossAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance. By dynamically leveraging the strengths of diverse action spaces, our model significantly outperforms fixed-action baselines, exhibiting superior generalization and efficiency in long-horizon reasoning.

Since the communication overhead of loading this small number of activated experts into RAM during inference is negligible, expert parameters can be offloaded to storage, making MoLE suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Building on this representation, we introduce UniPart, a two-stage latent diffusion framework for image-guided part-level 3D generation.

However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training. Experimental validation on the CIGRE 18-bus distribution system shows that this embedding-loss approach achieves low prediction errors, with bus voltage MSEs of 6.92e-07 (GCN), 1.21e-06 (GAT), 3.29e-05 (GPS), and 9.04e-07 (SAGE).

However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like \"hole\", \"cut\", \"scratch\" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of \"abnormal\" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset. The results suggest that compared to the baseline models, DAPO achieves a 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision metrics at the image level under distribution shift, and a 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDAPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8c03\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7f3a\u9677\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u56fa\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9+\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ca\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AUROC\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982'\u5b54\u6d1e'\u3001'\u5212\u75d5'\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec6\u8282\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5f02\u5e38\u6839\u6e90\u548c\u91c7\u53d6\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63aa\u65bd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6bcf\u79cd\u7f3a\u9677\u63d0\u793a\u8d39\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u4eba\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAPO\uff08Defect-aware Prompt Optimization\uff09\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60token\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7f3a\u9677\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f02\u5e38\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u591a\u7c7b\u578b/\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728MPDD\u3001VisA\u3001MVTec-AD\u3001MAD\u3001Real-IAD\u53ca\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0cDAPO\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7AUROC\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53473.7%\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u65b0\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53476.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "DAPO\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u522b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u8d28\u68c0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

In order to fit lifetime and energy consumption requirements when operating on battery, such hardware uses microcontrollers (MCUs) with tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. In this context, optimizing data flows across neural network layers becomes crucial. In this paper, we introduce TinyD\u00e9j\u00e0Vu, a new framework and novel algorithms we designed to drastically reduce the RAM footprint required by inference using various tiny ML models for sensor data time-series on typical microcontroller hardware. We publish the implementation of TinyD\u00e9j\u00e0Vu as open source, and we perform reproducible benchmarks on hardware.

To this end, we propose \\textbf{DivMorph}, a modular training paradigm that leverages knowledge diversion to learn decomposable controllers. DivMorph factorizes randomly initialized Transformer weights into factor units via SVD prior to training and employs dynamic soft gating to modulate these units based on task and morphology embeddings, separating them into shared \\textit{learngenes} and morphology- and task-specific \\textit{tailors}, thereby achieving knowledge disentanglement. By selectively activating relevant components, DivMorph enables scalable and efficient policy deployment while supporting effective policy transfer to novel tasks.

In parallel, new embedded software building blocks are more and more written in Rust, while C/C++ dominance fades in this domain. On the other hand, small artificial neural networks (ANN) of various kinds are increasingly deployed in edge AI use cases, thus deployed and executed directly on low-power MCUs. In this context, both incremental improvements and novel innovative services will have to be continuously retrofitted using ANNs execution in software embedded on sensing/actuating systems already deployed in the field. However, there was so far no Rust embedded software platform automating parallelization for inference computation on multi-core MCUs executing arbitrary TinyML models. This paper thus fills this gap by introducing Ariel-ML, a novel toolkit we designed combining a generic TinyML pipeline and an embedded Rust software platform which can take full advantage of multi-core capabilities of various 32bit microcontroller families (Arm Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP-32).

The current research introduces novel approaches for constructing fair k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and fair epsilon-neighborhood graphs that proactively enforce demographic parity during graph formation. By incorporating fairness constraints at the earliest stage of neighborhood selection steps, our approaches incorporate proportional representation of sensitive features into the local graph structure while maintaining geometric consistency.Our work addresses a critical gap in pre-processing for fair spectral clustering, demonstrating that topological fairness in graph construction is essential for achieving equitable clustering outcomes. Widely used graph construction methods like kNN and epsilon-neighborhood graphs propagate edge based disparate impact on sensitive groups, leading to biased clustering results. Providing representation of each sensitive group in the neighborhood of every node leads to fairer spectral clustering results because the topological features of the graph naturally reflect equitable group ratios. This research fills an essential shortcoming in fair unsupervised learning, by illustrating how topological fairness in graph construction inherently facilitates fairer spectral clustering results without the need for changes to the clustering algorithm itself.

Multispectral images (MSIs) capture additional spectral cues across multiple bands, offering a promising alternative. However, the lack of training data has been the primary bottleneck to exploiting the potential of MSIs. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues. OSSDet employs a cascaded spectral-spatial modulation structure to optimize target perception, aggregates spectrally related features by exploiting spectral similarities to reinforce intra-object correlations, and suppresses irrelevant background via object-aware masking. Moreover, cross-spectral attention further refines object-related representations under explicit object-aware guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSSDet outperforms existing methods with comparable parameters and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u822a\u62cd\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6MODA\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86OSSDet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u7684\u5149\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u8c03\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5149\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u822a\u62cd\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u5c0f\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u5f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u867d\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5236\u7ea6\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u822a\u62cd\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6MODA\uff0814,041\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c330,191\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51faOSSDet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ea7\u8054\u5149\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u8c03\u5236\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u8c31\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u53ca\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "OSSDet\u5728\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u822a\u62cd\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MODA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u822a\u62cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0cOSSDet\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08XGBoost\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001LSTM\uff09\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u52a0\u5dde\u91ce\u706b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u6251\u706d\u5929\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eXGBoost\u5728\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u800cLSTM\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u5dde\u91ce\u706b\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u6216\u706b\u52bf\u8513\u5ef6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6251\u706d\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cbe\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5e94\u6025\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u52a0\u5ddeFRAP\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u91ce\u706b\u6251\u706d\u65f6\u957f\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u96c6\u6210\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "XGBoost\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u66f4\u64c5\u957f\u5904\u7406\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff1bLSTM\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6839\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u91ce\u706b\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u53ef\u9009\u62e9XGBoost\u7b49\u5408\u9002\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6251\u706d\u65f6\u957f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002"}}

CNN-based SSL struggles to capture disease patterns that evolve continuously along leaf structures, while transformer-based SSL introduces quadratic attention cost from high-resolution patches. To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface. A prototype-driven teacher-student objective aligns representations across multiple views, encouraging stable and lesion-aware features from labelled data. Experiments on three publicly available plant disease datasets show that StateSpace-SSL consistently outperforms the CNN- and transformer-based SSL baselines in various evaluation metrics.

Traditional regret-minimisation bandit strategies like Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) typically rely on distributional assumptions or asymptotic guarantees; further, they remain largely focused on regret, neglecting their statistical properties. We address this gap. Through the adoption of CP, we bridge the regret-minimising potential of a decision-making bandit policy with statistical guarantees in the form of finite-time prediction coverage.\n  We demonstrate the potential of it Conformal Bandits through simulation studies and an application to portfolio allocation, a typical small-gap regime, where differences in arm rewards are far too small for classical policies to achieve optimal regret bounds in finite sample. Motivated by this, we showcase our framework's practical advantage in terms of regret in small-gap settings, as well as its added value in achieving nominal coverage guarantees where classical UCB policies fail. Focusing on our application of interest, we further illustrate how integrating hidden Markov models to capture the regime-switching behaviour of financial markets, enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and translates into higher risk-adjusted regret efficiency returns, while preserving coverage guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Conformal Bandits\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Conformal Prediction\uff08CP\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u6094\u503c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u5c0f\u95f4\u9699\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u91d1\u878d\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5e26\u5bbd\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982Thompson Sampling\u548cUCB\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c0f\u95f4\u9699\uff08small-gap\uff09\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u540e\u6094\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Conformal Prediction\u4e0e\u5e26\u5bbd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efaConformal Bandits\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u914d\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u878d\u5408\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u5e02\u573a\u72b6\u6001\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u95f4\u9699\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u540e\u6094\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u6ee1\u8db3\u9884\u8bbe\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408HMM\u540e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7684\u540e\u6094\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "Conformal Bandits\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u540e\u6094\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2f\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, due to the small size and the lack of intrinsic features of infrared small targets, the existing methods generally have the problem of inaccurate edge positioning and the target is easily submerged by the background. Therefore, we propose an innovative gradient-guided learning network (GGL-Net). Specifically, we are the first to explore the introduction of gradient magnitude images into the deep learning-based infrared small target detection method, which is conducive to emphasizing the edge details and alleviating the problem of inaccurate edge positioning of small targets. On this basis, we propose a novel dual-branch feature extraction network that utilizes the proposed gradient supplementary module (GSM) to encode raw gradient information into deeper network layers and embeds attention mechanisms reasonably to enhance feature extraction ability. In addition, we construct a two-way guidance fusion module (TGFM), which fully considers the characteristics of feature maps at different levels.

We present \\textbf{HPM-KD}, a framework that integrates six synergistic components: (i) Adaptive Configuration Manager via meta-learning that eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning, (ii) Progressive Distillation Chain with automatically determined intermediate models, (iii) Attention-Weighted Multi-Teacher Ensemble that learns dynamic per-sample weights, (iv) Meta-Learned Temperature Scheduler that adapts temperature throughout training, (v) Parallel Processing Pipeline with intelligent load balancing, and (vi) Shared Optimization Memory for cross-experiment reuse. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and tabular datasets demonstrate that HPM-KD: achieves 10x-15x compression while maintaining 85% accuracy retention, eliminates the need for manual tuning, and reduces training time by 30-40% via parallelization.

To assist in such planning, we address the challenge of predicting a patient-specific reconstruction target from a CT of the fractured tibia. Our ap- proach combines neural registration and autoencoder models. Specifically, we first train a modified spatial transformer network (STN) to register a raw CT to a standardized coordinate system of a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model healthy tibial varia- tions. Both the STN and AE models are further designed to be robust to masked input, allowing us to apply them to fractured CTs and decode to a prediction of the patient-specific healthy bone in standard coordinates. Our contributions include: i) a 3D-adapted STN for global spatial registration, ii) a comparative analysis of AEs for bone CT modeling, and iii) the extension of both to handle masked inputs for predictive generation of healthy bone structures.

As a result, the DWT enables subband decomposition, while the inverse DWT reconstructs the final high-resolution output.

Koutsomitropoulos"], "title": "Hands-on Evaluation of Visual Transformers for Object Recognition and Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision sometimes struggle with understanding images in a global context, as they mainly focus on local patterns. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model.

Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.\n  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models.

However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline.

However, the extent to which different model architectures capture antibody-specific biological properties remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate how architectural choices in PLMs influence their ability to comprehend antibody sequence characteristics and functions. We evaluate three state-of-the-art PLMs-AntiBERTa, BioBERT, and ESM2--against a general-purpose language model (GPT-2) baseline on antibody target specificity prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that while all PLMs achieve high classification accuracy, they exhibit distinct biases in capturing biological features such as V gene usage, somatic hypermutation patterns, and isotype information. Through attention attribution analysis, we show that antibody-specific models like AntiBERTa naturally learn to focus on complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), while general protein models benefit significantly from explicit CDR-focused training strategies. These findings provide insights into the relationship between model architecture and biological feature extraction, offering valuable guidance for future PLM development in computational antibody design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08PLMs\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u6297\u4f53\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6297\u4f53\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982AntiBERTa\uff09\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5173\u6ce8\u4e92\u8865\u51b3\u5b9a\u533a\uff08CDRs\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u7528\u86cb\u767d\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u663e\u5f0fCDR\u5bfc\u5411\u8bad\u7ec3\u624d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6297\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684PLM\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6355\u6349\u6297\u4f53\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982V\u57fa\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u4f53\u7ec6\u80de\u9ad8\u9891\u7a81\u53d8\u3001\u540c\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u524d\u6cbfPLM\uff08AntiBERTa\u3001BioBERT\u3001ESM2\uff09\u548c\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bGPT-2\u5728\u6297\u4f53\u9776\u6807\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9CDR\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709PLM\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff1bAntiBERTa\u81ea\u7136\u805a\u7126CDR\uff0c\u800cBioBERT\u548cESM2\u9700\u663e\u5f0fCDR\u8bad\u7ec3\u624d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u6297\u4f53\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6297\u4f53\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08\u5982CDR\u805a\u7126\uff09\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347PLM\u5728\u6297\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Although graph-based methods such as GraphTunnel achieve strong accuracy, they introduce significant latency and computational overhead due to recursive parsing and graph construction, limiting their suitability for real-time deployment. This work presents DNS-HyXNet, a lightweight extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) hybrid framework designed for efficient sequence-based DNS tunnel detection. DNS-HyXNet integrates tokenized domain embeddings with normalized numerical DNS features and processes them through a two-layer xLSTM network that directly learns temporal dependencies from packet sequences, eliminating the need for graph reconstruction and enabling single-stage multi-class classification. The model was trained and evaluated on two public benchmark datasets with carefully tuned hyperparameters to ensure low memory consumption and fast inference. Across all experimental splits of the DNS-Tunnel-Datasets, DNS-HyXNet achieved up to 99.99% accuracy, with macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-scores exceeding 99.96%, and demonstrated a per-sample detection latency of just 0.041 ms, confirming its scalability and real-time readiness.

By exploiting the structure of factored state spaces, we introduce an exact, search-based algorithm that circumvents the fidelity gaps of surrogate models.

However, despite their strong visual perception modules, these models often fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions such as blur, noise, and compression, and may produce inconsistent evaluations across repeated inferences. This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types. Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08IQA\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u538b\u7f29\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f31\u5316\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u5931\u771f\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece14.92%\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81f384.43%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65bd\u52a0\u4e13\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MLLMs\u5728IQA\u4e2d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u57fa\u672c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u611f\u77e5\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8d28\u7591\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49token\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u524d\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u5316\u4f7f\u5931\u771f\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece14.92%\u63d0\u5347\u81f384.43%\uff1b\u63ed\u793aMLLMs\u56e0\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u677f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u524a\u5f31\u6216\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65bd\u52a0\u4e13\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u5f3a\u5316\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MLLM\u5728\u4ee5\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

This study presents a robust and scalable modeling system for estimating soil properties in croplands, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), and pH, using remote sensing data and environmental covariates. The system employs a hybrid modeling approach, combining the indirect methods of modeling soil through proxies and drivers with direct spectral modeling. We extend current approaches by using interpretable physics-informed covariates derived from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and complex, nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level.

Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context.

Prior works have shown the possibilities of creating inter-agent cooperation between a group of AVs that follow a social utility. Such altruistic AVs can form alliances and affect the behavior of HVs to achieve socially desirable outcomes. We identify two major challenges in the co-existence of AVs and HVs. First, social preferences and individual traits of a given human driver, e.g., selflessness and aggressiveness are unknown to an AV, and it is almost impossible to infer them in real-time during a short AV-HV interaction. Second, contrary to AVs that are expected to follow a policy, HVs do not necessarily follow a stationary policy and therefore are extremely hard to predict. To alleviate the above-mentioned challenges, we formulate the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a decentralized framework and reward function for training cooperative AVs. Our approach enables AVs to learn the decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, optimizes for a social utility while prioritizing safety and allowing adaptability; robustifying altruistic AVs to different human behaviors and constraining them to a safe action space. Finally, we investigate the robustness, safety and sensitivity of AVs to various HVs behavioral traits and present the settings in which the AVs can learn cooperative policies that are adaptable to different situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AVs\uff09\u80fd\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\uff08HVs\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u793e\u4f1a\u6548\u7528\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u517c\u987e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5171\u5b58\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u597d\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7279\u8d28\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u65b0\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7fAVs\u80fd\u4ece\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60HV\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u6548\u7528\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7fAVs\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cHV\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6fc0\u8fdb\u3001\u81ea\u79c1\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u51fa\u517c\u987e\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u6548\u7528\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7MARL\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347AVs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u793e\u4f1a\u6700\u4f18\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

However, challenges have emerged, as these methods might generate unrealistic artifacts or hallucinations, which can interfere with analysis in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach for quantifying and comprehending hallucination artifacts to ensure trustworthy computer vision models. Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations. We test the proposed approach on the CANDELS astronomical image dataset with models such as U-Net, SwinUNet, and Learnlets, and provide new perspectives on hallucination from different aspects in deep learning-based image processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCHEM\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982U-Net\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u6ce2/\u526a\u5207\u6ce2\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5171\u5f62\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u903c\u8fd1\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790U\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "U-Net\u7b49U\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u5377\u79ef\u4e2d\u867d\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConformal Hallucination Estimation Metric\uff08CHEM\uff09\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u4e0e\u526a\u5207\u6ce2\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u5f62\u5316\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6c34\u5e73\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b3\uff09\u4ece\u903c\u8fd1\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790U\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u5e7b\u89c9\u6210\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u5728CANDELS\u5929\u6587\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CHEM\u5bf9U-Net\u3001SwinUNet\u548cLearnlets\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "CHEM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86U\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u903c\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u5173\u8054\u3002"}}

The safety and reliability of AVs will depend on their social awareness and their ability to engage in complex social interactions in a socially accepted manner. However, AVs are still inefficient in terms of cooperating with HVs and struggle to understand and adapt to human behavior, which is particularly challenging in mixed autonomy. In a road shared by AVs and HVs, the social preferences or individual traits of HVs are unknown to the AVs and different from AVs, which are expected to follow a policy, HVs are particularly difficult to forecast since they do not necessarily follow a stationary policy. To address these challenges, we frame the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose an approach that allows AVs to learn the decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, account for all vehicles' interests, and safely adapt to other traffic situations. In contrast with existing works, we quantify AVs' social preferences and propose a distributed reward structure that introduces altruism into their decision-making process, allowing the altruistic AVs to learn to establish coalitions and influence the behavior of HVs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AVs\uff09\u80fd\u5728\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08HVs\uff09\u6df7\u884c\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60HV\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u597d\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5229\u4ed6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u5f71\u54cdHV\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "AVs\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60HV\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cf\u5316AV\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u5229\u4ed6\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "AVs\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60HV\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6240\u6709\u8f66\u8f86\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff1b\u5229\u4ed6\u578bAV\u53ef\u5efa\u7acb\u5408\u4f5c\u8054\u76df\u5e76\u5f71\u54cdHV\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AV\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u8f66\u8def\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, compared to meshes or radiance fields, existing multiview diffusion models offer limited appearance manipulation, particularly in terms of material, texture, or style.\n  In this paper, we present a lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models. Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models. The experiments show that our method provides a simple yet effective way toward multiview generation with diverse appearance, advocating the adoption of implicit generative 3D representations in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u8fc1\u79fb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6750\u8d28\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5916\u89c2\u64cd\u63a7\uff08\u5982\u6750\u8d28\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u98ce\u683c\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf3D\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5982\u7f51\u683c\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\uff09\u867d\u652f\u6301\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u8f91\u4f46\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff1b\u9700\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5916\u89c2\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u91c7\u6837\u805a\u5408\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c11\u91cf\u5c42\u95f4\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u914d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5916\u89c2\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u663e\u5f0f\u5916\u89c2\u53c2\u6570\u6307\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5f0f3D\u8868\u793a\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u7eb3\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our research concentrates on a fundamental sub-problem: the fine-grained classification of atomic interaction states, namely 'approaching', 'grabbing', and 'holding'. To this end, we introduce a structured data engineering process that converts raw videos from the MANIAC dataset into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Each vector encapsulates relational and dynamic properties from a short temporal window of motion. Our initial hypothesis posited that sequential modeling would be critical, leading us to compare static classifiers (MLPs) against temporal models (RNNs). Counter-intuitively, the key discovery occurred when we set the sequence length of a Bidirectional RNN to one (seq_length=1). This modification converted the network's function, compelling it to act as a high-capacity static feature encoder. This architectural change directly led to a significant accuracy improvement, culminating in a final score of 97.60%. Of particular note, our optimized model successfully overcame the most challenging transitional class, 'grabbing', by achieving a balanced F1-score of 0.90.

However, leveraging real-world imaging data in clinical research environments is still hampered by strict regulatory constraints, fragmented software infrastructure, and the challenges inherent in conducting large-cohort multicentre studies. This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

However, their capability in understanding infrared images remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce IF-Bench, the first high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating multimodal understanding of infrared images. IF-Bench consists of 499 images sourced from 23 infrared datasets and 680 carefully curated visual question-answer pairs, covering 10 essential dimensions of image understanding. Based on this benchmark, we systematically evaluate over 40 open-source and closed-source MLLMs, employing cyclic evaluation, bilingual assessment, and hybrid judgment strategies to enhance the reliability of the results. Our analysis reveals how model scale, architecture, and inference paradigms affect infrared image comprehension, providing valuable insights for this area. Furthermore, we propose a training-free generative visual prompting (GenViP) method, which leverages advanced image editing models to translate infrared images into semantically and spatially aligned RGB counterparts, thereby mitigating domain distribution shifts.

This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs.

However, previous studies show that generated images often resemble the training data, and this problem becomes more severe as the model size increases. Memorizing training data can lead to legal challenges, including copyright infringement, violations of portrait rights, and trademark violations. Existing approaches to mitigating memorization mainly focus on manipulating the denoising sampling process to steer image embeddings away from the memorized embedding space or employ unlearning methods that require training on datasets containing specific sets of memorized concepts. However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization. Our work demonstrates that specific parts of the model are responsible for copyrighted content generation. By applying model pruning, we can effectively suppress the probability of generating copyrighted content without targeting specific concepts while preserving the general generative capabilities of the model. Additionally, we show that our approach is both orthogonal and complementary to existing unlearning methods, thereby highlighting its potential to improve current unlearning and de-memorization techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUniForget\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8d1f\u8d23\u751f\u6210\u7248\u6743\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u7248\u6743\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e92\u8865\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u6cd5\u5f8b\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u7248\u6743\u3001\u8096\u50cf\u6743\u3001\u5546\u6807\u4fb5\u6743\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u6216\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u8303\u56f4\u53d7\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniForget\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8d1f\u8d23\u751f\u6210\u7248\u6743\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6307\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "UniForget\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u7248\u6743\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u53ef\u8054\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u53bb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u89c4\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Standard architectures utilizing stride-32 (P5) layers often fail to resolve narrow vessels, resulting in spatial feature dilution. In this work, we propose LiM-YOLO, a specialized detector designed to resolve these domain-specific conflicts. Based on a statistical analysis of ship scales, we introduce a Pyramid Level Shift Strategy that reconfigures the detection head to P2-P4. This shift ensures compliance with Nyquist sampling criteria for small objects while eliminating the computational redundancy of deep layers.

Created using style transfer techniques from 12 subject classification datasets, SMA provides a diverse and extensive set of 4800 groups, combining various subjects (objects, plants, animals, human actions, textures) with multiple styles. SMA enables flexible control over groups and classes, allowing us to configure datasets to reflect diverse benchmark scenarios. While ideally, data collection would capture extensive group diversity, practical constraints often make this infeasible. SMA addresses this by enabling large and configurable group structures through flexible control over styles, subject classes, and domains-allowing datasets to reflect a wide range of real-world benchmark scenarios. This design not only expands group and class diversity, but also opens new methodological directions for evaluating model performance across diverse group and domain configurations-including scenarios with many minority groups, varying group imbalance, and complex domain shifts-and for studying fairness, robustness, and adaptation under a broader range of realistic conditions. To demonstrate SMA's effectiveness, we implemented two benchmarks: (1) a novel OOD generalization and group fairness benchmark leveraging SMA's domain, class, and group diversity to evaluate existing benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while simple balancing and algorithms utilizing group information remain competitive as claimed in previous benchmarks, increasing group diversity significantly impacts fairness, altering the superiority and relative rankings of algorithms. We also propose to use \\textit{Top-M worst group accuracy} as a new hyperparameter tuning metric, demonstrating broader fairness during optimization and delivering better final worst-group accuracy for larger group diversity. (2) An unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) benchmark utilizing SMA's group diversity to evaluate UDA algorithms across more scenarios, offering a more comprehensive benchmark with lower error bars (reduced by 73\\% and 28\\% in closed-set setting and UniDA setting, respectively) compared to existing efforts.

Preprint version", "summary": "Estimating the 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a spacecraft from a single image is critical for autonomous operations like in-orbit servicing and space debris removal. Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of \"apparent rotation\", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset. Furthermore, we validate our model's suitability for real-world space missions by quantizing it and deploying it on power-constrained edge hardware.

However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\\%, 5\\%, and 10\\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores.

A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity. Extensive experiments across single- and multi-subject PT2I tasks verify that our DynaIP outperforms existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in the field of PT2l generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08PT2I\uff09\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5faa\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u53ca\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728SOTA\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563Transformer\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PT2I\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u4fdd\u7559\uff08CP\uff09\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5faa\uff08PF\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDynaIP\u63d2\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eMM-DiT\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u4e2d\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u65f6\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u89e3\u8026\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u6982\u5ff5\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u6270\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528CLIP\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e0e\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53PT2I\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cDynaIP\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001CP-PF\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u53ca\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaIP\u4e3aPT2I\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We adapt two off-the-shelf models as baselines for online struggle detection and anticipation. Online struggle detection achieves 70-80% per-frame mAP, while struggle anticipation up to 2 seconds ahead yields comparable performance with slight drops. We further examine generalization across tasks and activities and analyse the impact of skill evolution. Despite larger domain gaps in activity-level generalization, models still outperform random baselines by 4-20%.

Existing vision-language-action (VLA)-based methods cannot leverage unlabeled videos for visual causal learning, while world model-based methods lack reasoning capabilities from large language models. In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unified Understanding-Generation-Planning framework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trained VLMs and video generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance.

The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling.

We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities.

However, their ability to proactively reason and act based solely on visual inputs, without explicit textual prompts, remains underexplored. We introduce a new task, Visual Action Reasoning, and propose VisualActBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1,074 videos and 3,733 human-annotated actions across four real-world scenarios. Each action is labeled with an Action Prioritization Level (APL) and a proactive-reactive type to assess models' human-aligned reasoning and value sensitivity.

This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction.

We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture. The model's internal VLM provides intrinsic feedback by assessing whether the edited video logically satisfies the given instruction. The differential feedback that refines the generator's reasoning behavior during training.

However, these methods degrade sharply under sparse-view settings, where limited observations lead to severe ambiguity between geometry, reflectance, and lighting. We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.
