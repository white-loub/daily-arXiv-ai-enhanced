### [1] [Gaussian Mesh Renderer for Lightweight Differentiable Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14493)
*Xinpeng Liu,Fumio Okura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为高斯网格渲染器（GMR）的轻量级可微分网格渲染器，利用3D高斯点绘（3DGS）的高效光栅化过程，将高斯表示与三角网格表示紧密结合，从而在保持结构保真度的同时实现更平滑的梯度和更高效的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于三角网格的可微分渲染器存在优化速度慢或计算开销大的问题，而3D高斯点绘虽高效但不直接支持网格表示；因此需要一种兼顾二者优势的新方法。

Method: 提出高斯网格渲染器（GMR），将每个高斯基元从对应网格三角形解析推导而来，利用3DGS的高效光栅化流程实现可微分渲染，并保证梯度可回传。

Result: 相比传统网格渲染器，GMR实现了更平滑的梯度，尤其在小批量、内存受限条件下优化效果更优；代码已开源。

Conclusion: GMR成功融合了3DGS的高效性与网格表示的结构性，在保持几何保真度的同时显著提升了可微分网格渲染的优化效率与实用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled high-fidelity virtualization with fast rendering and optimization for novel view synthesis. On the other hand, triangle mesh models still remain a popular choice for surface reconstruction but suffer from slow or heavy optimization in traditional mesh-based differentiable renderers. To address this problem, we propose a new lightweight differentiable mesh renderer leveraging the efficient rasterization process of 3DGS, named Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR), which tightly integrates the Gaussian and mesh representations. Each Gaussian primitive is analytically derived from the corresponding mesh triangle, preserving structural fidelity and enabling the gradient flow. Compared to the traditional mesh renderers, our method achieves smoother gradients, which especially contributes to better optimization using smaller batch sizes with limited memory. Our implementation is available in the public GitHub repository at https://github.com/huntorochi/Gaussian-Mesh-Renderer.

### [2] [Beyond Ground: Map-Free LiDAR Relocalization for UAVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13267)
*Hengyu Mu,Jianshi Wu,Yuxin Guo,XianLian Lin,Qingyong Hu,Chenglu Wen,Cheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MAILS框架，专为无人机（UAV）设计的无地图LiDAR重定位方法，通过局部保持滑动窗口注意力、坐标无关特征初始化与位置编码机制提升稀疏点云下对大偏航角和高度变化的鲁棒性，并构建首个面向UAV真实飞行特性的大规模LiDAR重定位数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR重定位方法主要面向自动驾驶，在无人机场景中因大偏航旋转、高度变化及不规则轨迹等特性导致精度显著下降；且缺乏适配UAV飞行特点的基准数据集。

Method: 提出MAILS框架：1）Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention模块提取局部判别几何特征；2）坐标无关特征初始化 + 局部不变位置编码机制增强姿态与高度变化下的鲁棒性；3）构建包含四个场景、多种飞行轨迹的大规模UAV专用LiDAR重定位数据集。

Result: 在自建UAV数据集上实验表明，MAILS在定位精度上显著优于现有方法，具备良好鲁棒性与实用性。

Conclusion: MAILS是首个专为UAV定制的无地图LiDAR重定位框架，兼顾算法创新与数据支撑，有效解决了GNSS拒止环境下无人机高精度重定位难题。

Abstract: Localization is a fundamental capability in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Map-free LiDAR relocalization offers an effective solution for achieving high-precision positioning in environments with weak or unavailable GNSS signals. However, existing LiDAR relocalization methods are primarily tailored to autonomous driving, exhibiting significantly degraded accuracy in UAV scenarios. In this paper, we propose MAILS, a novel map-free LiDAR relocalization framework for UAVs. A Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention module is first introduced to extract locally discriminative geometric features from sparse point clouds. To handle substantial yaw rotations and altitude variations encountered during UAV flight, we then design a coordinate-independent feature initialization module and a locally invariant positional encoding mechanism, which together significantly enhance the robustness of feature extraction. Furthermore, existing LiDAR-based relocalization datasets fail to capture real-world UAV flight characteristics, such as irregular trajectories and varying altitudes. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale LiDAR localization dataset for UAVs, which comprises four scenes and various flight trajectories, designed to evaluate UAV relocalization performance under realistic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves satisfactory localization precision and consistently outperforms existing techniques by a significant margin. Our code and dataset will be released soon.

### [3] [Explanatory Interactive Machine Learning for Bias Mitigation in Visual Gender Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13286)
*Nathanya Satriani,Djordje Slijepčević,Markus Schedl,Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了可解释交互式学习（XIL）在缓解视觉分类器中的偏差和虚假相关性方面的潜力，特别是在性别分类等易受数据偏差影响的场景中；比较了CAIPI、RRR及一种新提出的混合方法，并通过GradCAM和BLA评估其解释质量，结果表明XIL能有效提升模型关注相关特征的能力与公平性，其中CAIPI甚至可略微提升分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉分类器中因数据偏差导致的模型偏见和虚假相关问题，尤其在敏感任务如性别分类中提升公平性与可解释性。

Method: 采用两种主流XIL策略（CAIPI和Right for the Right Reasons, RRR）及其新提出的混合方法，在性别分类任务上进行实验；使用GradCAM和BLA生成解释并量化评估分割掩码与解释的一致性。

Result: CAIPI最能引导模型关注相关图像特征；所有XIL方法均降低了男女误分类率差异，提升了公平性；XIL整体带来轻微性能下降，但CAIPI例外，反而可能提升分类准确率。

Conclusion: XIL范式能有效增强模型透明度与公平性，尤其CAIPI在兼顾解释质量、去偏与性能方面表现突出，为构建更可信的视觉分类系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Explanatory interactive learning (XIL) enables users to guide model training in machine learning (ML) by providing feedback on the model's explanations, thereby helping it to focus on features that are relevant to the prediction from the user's perspective. In this study, we explore the capability of this learning paradigm to mitigate bias and spurious correlations in visual classifiers, specifically in scenarios prone to data bias, such as gender classification. We investigate two methodologically different state-of-the-art XIL strategies, i.e., CAIPI and Right for the Right Reasons (RRR), as well as a novel hybrid approach that combines both strategies. The results are evaluated quantitatively by comparing segmentation masks with explanations generated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) and Bounded Logit Attention (BLA). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in (i) guiding ML models to focus on relevant image features, particularly when CAIPI is used, and (ii) reducing model bias (i.e., balancing the misclassification rates between male and female predictions). Our analysis further supports the potential of XIL methods to improve fairness in gender classifiers. Overall, the increased transparency and fairness obtained by XIL leads to slight performance decreases with an exception being CAIPI, which shows potential to even improve classification accuracy.

### [4] [COOPERTRIM: Adaptive Data Selection for Uncertainty-Aware Cooperative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13287)
*Shilpa Mukhopadhyay,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Hang Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出COOPERTRIM框架，利用时间连续性动态选择需共享的特征，显著降低带宽需求，同时保持感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协同感知中通信带宽有限与传感器信息丰富之间的矛盾，避免冗余静态信息传输。

Method: 提出自适应特征选择框架COOPERTRIM，引入共形时间不确定性度量评估特征相关性，并通过数据驱动机制动态确定共享特征数量。

Result: 在语义分割和3D检测任务上分别实现最高80.28%和72.52%带宽压缩，IoU相对提升达45.54%，结合压缩策略后带宽可降至1.46%仍不损失性能。

Conclusion: COOPERTRIM具备环境动态适应性、鲁棒性与灵活性，为协同感知实际部署提供可行路径。

Abstract: Cooperative perception enables autonomous agents to share encoded representations over wireless communication to enhance each other's live situational awareness. However, the tension between the limited communication bandwidth and the rich sensor information hinders its practical deployment. Recent studies have explored selection strategies that share only a subset of features per frame while striving to keep the performance on par. Nevertheless, the bandwidth requirement still stresses current wireless technologies. To fundamentally ease the tension, we take a proactive approach, exploiting the temporal continuity to identify features that capture environment dynamics, while avoiding repetitive and redundant transmission of static information. By incorporating temporal awareness, agents are empowered to dynamically adapt the sharing quantity according to environment complexity. We instantiate this intuition into an adaptive selection framework, COOPERTRIM, which introduces a novel conformal temporal uncertainty metric to gauge feature relevance, and a data-driven mechanism to dynamically determine the sharing quantity. To evaluate COOPERTRIM, we take semantic segmentation and 3D detection as example tasks. Across multiple open-source cooperative segmentation and detection models, COOPERTRIM achieves up to 80.28% and 72.52% bandwidth reduction respectively while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Relative to other selection strategies, COOPERTRIM also improves IoU by as much as 45.54% with up to 72% less bandwidth. Combined with compression strategies, COOPERTRIM can further reduce bandwidth usage to as low as 1.46% without compromising IoU performance. Qualitative results show COOPERTRIM gracefully adapts to environmental dynamics, localization error, and communication latency, demonstrating flexibility and paving the way for real-world deployment.

### [5] [Evaluating the Impact of Post-Training Quantization on Reliable VQA with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13289)
*Paul Jonas Kurz,Tobias Jan Wieczorek,Mohamed A. Abdelsalam,Rahaf Aljundi,Marcus Rohrbach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) affects both accuracy and reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Visual Question Answering, and proposes adapting the Selector confidence estimator to mitigate reliability loss—achieving strong efficiency-reliability trade-offs with int4 MBQ + Selector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from overconfidence (high certainty but incorrect answers) and are too large for edge deployment; this work bridges the gap between quantization (for efficiency) and reliability (for trustworthy predictions).

Method: Evaluates two MLLMs (Qwen2-VL-7B, Idefics3-8B) under data-free (HQQ) and data-aware (MBQ) PTQ across bit widths; adapts the Selector confidence estimator for quantized multimodal settings and tests it on in-distribution and OOD scenarios.

Result: PTQ harms both accuracy and reliability; data-aware MBQ mitigates this degradation; Selector significantly improves reliability across quantization levels and OOD cases; int4 MBQ + Selector achieves near-uncompressed reliability at ~75% less memory.

Conclusion: Quantization and reliability are tightly coupled in MLLMs; data-aware PTQ combined with adapted confidence estimation enables efficient yet reliable edge-deployable multimodal models—this is the first systematic study of this linkage.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) are increasingly deployed in domains where both reliability and efficiency are critical. However, current models remain overconfident, producing highly certain but incorrect answers. At the same time, their large size limits deployment on edge devices, necessitating compression. We study the intersection of these two challenges by analyzing how Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) compression affects both accuracy and reliability in Visual Question Answering (VQA). We evaluate two MLLMs, Qwen2-VL-7B and Idefics3-8B, quantized with data-free (HQQ) and data-aware (MBQ) methods across multiple bit widths. To counteract the reduction in reliability caused by quantization, we adapt the Selector confidence estimator for quantized multimodal settings and test its robustness across various quantization levels and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We find that PTQ degrades both accuracy and reliability. Data-aware methods soften the effect thereof. The Selector substantially mitigates the reliability impact. The combination of int4 MBQ and the Selector achieves the best efficiency-reliability trade-off, closing in on uncompressed performance at approx. 75% less memory demand. Overall, we present the first systematic study linking quantization and reliability in multimodal settings.

### [6] [NutVLM: A Self-Adaptive Defense Framework against Full-Dimension Attacks for Vision Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13293)
*Xiaoxu Peng,Dong Zhou,Jianwen Zhang,Guanghui Sun,Anh Tu Ngo,Anupam Chattopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出NutVLM，一种自适应防御框架，通过NutNet++检测与分类威胁，并分别采用灰度掩码和专家引导的对抗提示调优（EAPT）净化局部与全局对抗扰动，在Dolphins基准上提升整体指标4.89%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在自动驾驶中易受对抗攻击，且当前防御方法难以兼顾鲁棒性与干净样本性能。

Method: 提出NutVLM框架：1）NutNet++作为哨兵进行三类分类（良性样本、局部补丁、全局扰动）；2）对局部威胁采用灰度掩码净化；3）对全局扰动采用无需全模型微调的Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning（EAPT），通过梯度优化与离散投影生成矫正驾驶提示。

Result: 在Dolphins基准上，NutVLM使Accuracy、Language Score和GPT Score等整体指标提升4.89%。

Conclusion: NutVLM是一种可扩展、高效且兼顾鲁棒性与原始性能的自动驾驶VLM安全防御方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have advanced perception in autonomous driving (AD), but they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats. These risks range from localized physical patches to imperceptible global perturbations. Existing defense methods for VLMs remain limited and often fail to reconcile robustness with clean-sample performance. To bridge these gaps, we propose NutVLM, a comprehensive self-adaptive defense framework designed to secure the entire perception-decision lifecycle. Specifically, we first employ NutNet++ as a sentinel, which is a unified detection-purification mechanism. It identifies benign samples, local patches, and global perturbations through three-way classification. Subsequently, localized threats are purified via efficient grayscale masking, while global perturbations trigger Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning (EAPT). Instead of the costly parameter updates of full-model fine-tuning, EAPT generates "corrective driving prompts" via gradient-based latent optimization and discrete projection. These prompts refocus the VLM's attention without requiring exhaustive full-model retraining. Evaluated on the Dolphins benchmark, our NutVLM yields a 4.89% improvement in overall metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Language Score, and GPT Score). These results validate NutVLM as a scalable security solution for intelligent transportation. Our code is available at https://github.com/PXX/NutVLM.

### [7] [VisPhyWorld: Probing Physical Reasoning via Code-Driven Video Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13294)
*Jiarong Liang,Max Ku,Ka-Hei Hui,Ping Nie,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VisPhyWorld框架和VisPhyBench基准，通过要求多模态大语言模型生成可执行的物理仿真代码来评估其物理推理能力，强调可检验、可编辑、可证伪的世界表征，发现当前MLLMs在物理参数推断与动态一致性上仍存在明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理推理评估方法（如VQA、VoE）多依赖识别式任务，易绕过显式、可检验的物理假设，难以真实衡量模型对物理动力学的理解能力。

Method: 提出VisPhyWorld执行式评估框架，要求模型从视觉输入生成可运行的物理仿真代码；基于该框架构建VisPhyBench基准，含209个场景（源自108个物理模板），系统评估外观重建与物理运动合理性。

Result: VisPhyBench重建视频有效率达97.7%；实验表明SOTA MLLMs具备强语义理解能力，但在物理参数推断与动态一致性模拟方面表现薄弱。

Conclusion: 生成可执行物理代码是更严格、可验证的物理推理评估范式；当前MLLMs尚未真正掌握底层物理机制，仅停留在表层感知与语义关联层面。

Abstract: Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics.

*Edwyn Brient,Santiago Velasco-Forero,Rami Kassab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于HRRP数据物理分解（掩码、特征、噪声）的新型评估指标，以克服现有黑箱分类模型评估方法缺乏可解释性和多层级评估能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HRRP生成数据的评估依赖于‘黑箱’分类模型，缺乏可解释性和多层级评估能力。

Method: 将HRRP数据分解为掩码、特征和噪声三个物理可解释成分，并据此设计两种新型评估指标。

Result: 在昂贵且具挑战性的数据集上验证了所提指标具有良好的判别能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于物理分解的评估指标能提供更可解释、更细粒度的HRRP生成数据质量评价。

Abstract: High-resolution range profile (HRRP ) data are in vogue in radar automatic target recognition (RATR). With the interest in classifying models using HRRP, filling gaps in datasets using generative models has recently received promising contributions. Evaluating generated data is a challenging topic, even for explicit data like face images. However, the evaluation methods used in the state-ofthe-art of HRRP generation rely on classification models. Such models, called ''black-box'', do not allow either explainability on generated data or multi-level evaluation. This work focuses on decomposing HRRP data into three components: the mask, the features, and the noise. Using this decomposition, we propose two metrics based on the physical interpretation of those data. We take profit from an expensive dataset to evaluate our metrics on a challenging task and demonstrate the discriminative ability of those.

### [9] [Conditional Generative Models for High-Resolution Range Profiles: Capturing Geometry-Driven Trends in a Large-Scale Maritime Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13297)
*Edwyn Brient,Santiago Velasco-Forero,Rami Kassab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了在大规模海事数据库上进行高分辨率距离剖面（HRRP）合成，发现几何因素（如船舶尺寸和方位角）是影响HRRP生成的关键，并基于这些变量训练生成模型以提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRRP对采集条件高度敏感，导致在不同作战场景下鲁棒性差；现有条件生成方法受限于小而特定的数据集。

Method: 在大规模、具代表性的沿海监视海事数据库上分析HRRP生成；识别关键场景驱动因素（船舶尺寸与方位角），并以此为条件训练生成模型。

Result: 合成的HRRP能复现真实数据中预期的视线方向几何趋势，验证了几何因素对HRRP生成的核心作用。

Conclusion: 采集几何（尤其是船舶尺寸和方位角）是实现鲁棒HRRP生成的决定性因素，应作为条件生成的关键变量。

Abstract: High-resolution range profiles (HRRPs) enable fast onboard processing for radar automatic target recognition, but their strong sensitivity to acquisition conditions limits robustness across operational scenarios. Conditional HRRP generation can mitigate this issue, yet prior studies are constrained by small, highly specific datasets. We study HRRP synthesis on a largescale maritime database representative of coastal surveillance variability. Our analysis indicates that the fundamental scenario drivers are geometric: ship dimensions and the desired aspect angle. Conditioning on these variables, we train generative models and show that the synthesized signatures reproduce the expected line-of-sight geometric trend observed in real data. These results highlight the central role of acquisition geometry for robust HRRP generation.

### [10] [Effect of Convolutional Depth on Image Recognition Performance: VGG vs. ResNet vs. GoogLeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13298)
*Manfred M. Fischer,Joshua Pitts*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过控制实验比较了VGG、ResNet和GoogLeNet三种CNN架构，指出影响性能的关键是有效深度（effective depth）而非名义深度（nominal depth），并强调残差和Inception结构能更高效地利用深度提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深层卷积网络虽推动图像识别进步，但单纯增加深度并不总带来精度提升、优化稳定性和计算效率，需探究深度影响性能的真实机制。

Method: 对VGG、ResNet和GoogLeNet进行标准化训练下的受控对比研究，区分并分析名义深度与有效深度，考察其对分类精度、收敛行为和计算效率的影响。

Result:  plain深层网络易出现精度饱和和优化不稳定；而ResNet和GoogLeNet等具备特定结构机制的模型能在更低有效深度下持续提升精度，并获得更优的精度-计算权衡。

Conclusion: 决定深度是否提升性能的核心变量是有效深度，而非名义深度；架构设计通过约束深度在训练中的实际作用方式，决定了深度作为扩展维度的有效性。

Abstract: Increasing convolutional depth has been central to advances in image recognition, yet deeper networks do not uniformly yield higher accuracy, stable optimization, or efficient computation. We present a controlled comparative study of three canonical convolutional neural network architectures - VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet - to isolate how depth influences classification performance, convergence behavior, and computational efficiency. By standardizing training protocols and explicitly distinguishing between nominal and effective depth, we show that the benefits of depth depend critically on architectural mechanisms that constrain its effective manifestation during training rather than on nominal depth alone. Although plain deep networks exhibit early accuracy saturation and optimization instability, residual and inception-based architectures consistently translate additional depth into improved accuracy at lower effective depth and favorable accuracy-compute trade-offs. These findings demonstrate that effective depth, not nominal depth, is the operative quantity governing depth's role as a productive scaling dimension in convolutional networks.

### [11] [KidMesh: Computational Mesh Reconstruction for Pediatric Congenital Hydronephrosis Using Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13299)
*Haoran Sun,Zhanpeng Zhu,Anguo Zhang,Bo Liu,Zhaohua Lin,Liqin Huang,Mingjing Yang,Lei Liu,Shan Lin,Wangbin Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端深度学习方法KidMesh，直接从磁共振尿路造影（MRU）图像中自动重建儿童先天性肾积水（CH）的三维网格模型，无需依赖难以获取的精细网格标注，且避免了传统分割后复杂后处理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的分割方法仅提供形态学信息，难以支持功能评估（如尿动力学仿真），需额外复杂后处理转换为网格；而高质量网格标注因MRU切片稀疏而难以获得。

Method: KidMesh是一种基于深度神经网络的端到端方法：先从MRU图像提取特征图，再通过网格采样生成特征顶点，最后驱动模板网格形变以生成个体化CH网格；并设计了一种无需精确网格标注的新型训练策略。

Result: KidMesh平均0.4秒完成重建；顶点误差>3.2mm和>6.4mm的比例分别为3.7%和0.2%；栅格化后Dice得分为0.86；网格无自交；可直接用于肾尿流仿真。

Conclusion: KidMesh实现了高效、准确、即用型CH网格重建， bridging the gap between MRU影像与临床功能分析，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Pediatric congenital hydronephrosis (CH) is a common urinary tract disorder, primarily caused by obstruction at the renal pelvis-ureter junction. Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can visualize hydronephrosis, including renal pelvis and calyces, by utilizing the natural contrast provided by water. Existing voxel-based segmentation approaches can extract CH regions from MRU, facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, these segmentation methods predominantly focus on morphological features, such as size, shape, and structure. To enable functional assessments, such as urodynamic simulations, external complex post-processing steps are required to convert these results into mesh-level representations. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks, namely KidMesh, which could automatically reconstruct CH meshes directly from MRU. Generally, KidMesh extracts feature maps from MRU images and converts them into feature vertices through grid sampling. It then deforms a template mesh according to these feature vertices to generate the specific CH meshes of MRU images. Meanwhile, we develop a novel schema to train KidMesh without relying on accurate mesh-level annotations, which are difficult to obtain due to the sparsely sampled MRU slices. Experimental results show that KidMesh could reconstruct CH meshes in an average of 0.4 seconds, and achieve comparable performance to conventional methods without requiring post-processing. The reconstructed meshes exhibited no self-intersections, with only 3.7% and 0.2% of the vertices having error distances exceeding 3.2mm and 6.4mm, respectively. After rasterization, these meshes achieved a Dice score of 0.86 against manually delineated CH masks. Furthermore, these meshes could be used in renal urine flow simulations, providing valuable urodynamic information for clinical practice.

### [12] [DriveMamba: Task-Centric Scalable State Space Model for Efficient End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13301)
*Haisheng Su,Wei Wu,Feixiang Song,Junjie Zhang,Zhenjie Yang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DriveMamba，一种基于Mamba架构的任务中心式可扩展端到端自动驾驶框架，通过稀疏token表示、动态任务关系建模、隐式视图对应学习和长时序融合，克服了传统Transformer-based E2E-AD中信息损失、误差累积、计算复杂度高和多模态关系建模僵化等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法（如UniAD）采用顺序模块化设计与密集BEV特征，导致信息损失、累积误差、任务与传感器间关系建模不灵活；同时图像骨干网络训练不足、注意力机制二次复杂度限制了时空输入下的可扩展性与效率。

Method: 提出DriveMamba：1）将图像特征与任务输出转为按3D空间位置排序的token级稀疏表示；2）使用线性复杂度的Unified Mamba解码器实现动态任务关系建模、隐式视图对应学习与长时序融合；3）设计双向轨迹引导的'局部到全局'扫描策略以保持自车视角空间局部性，辅助规划。

Result: 在nuScenes和Bench2Drive数据集上实验表明，DriveMamba在性能、泛化性和推理效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DriveMamba通过引入Mamba替代Transformer，结合任务驱动的稀疏建模与时空优化机制，为高效、可扩展的端到端自动驾驶提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances towards End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) have been often devoted on integrating modular designs into a unified framework for joint optimization e.g. UniAD, which follow a sequential paradigm (i.e., perception-prediction-planning) based on separable Transformer decoders and rely on dense BEV features to encode scene representations. However, such manual ordering design can inevitably cause information loss and cumulative errors, lacking flexible and diverse relation modeling among different modules and sensors. Meanwhile, insufficient training of image backbone and quadratic-complexity of attention mechanism also hinder the scalability and efficiency of E2E-AD system to handle spatiotemporal input. To this end, we propose DriveMamba, a Task-Centric Scalable paradigm for efficient E2E-AD, which integrates dynamic task relation modeling, implicit view correspondence learning and long-term temporal fusion into a single-stage Unified Mamba decoder. Specifically, both extracted image features and expected task outputs are converted into token-level sparse representations in advance, which are then sorted by their instantiated positions in 3D space. The linear-complexity operator enables efficient long-context sequential token modeling to capture task-related inter-dependencies simultaneously. Additionally, a bidirectional trajectory-guided "local-to-global" scan method is designed to preserve spatial locality from ego-perspective, thus facilitating the ego-planning. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate the superiority, generalizability and great efficiency of DriveMamba.

### [13] [Spectral Collapse in Diffusion Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13303)
*Nicolas Bourriez,Alexandre Verine,Auguste Genovesio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为正交方差引导（OVG）的新方法，用于解决条件扩散反演在频谱稀疏源域（如超分辨率、草图到图像）中出现的频谱坍塌问题，从而在保持结构保真度的同时恢复逼真的纹理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准确定性反演方法（如DDIM）在源域频谱稀疏于目标域时失效，导致潜在表示偏离各向同性高斯分布，引发频谱坍塌，生成过度平滑、缺乏纹理的结果；而随机反演方法虽可恢复噪声方差，却易造成语义脱节和结构漂移。

Method: 提出正交方差引导（OVG），一种推理时方法，通过校正常微分方程（ODE）动力学，在结构梯度的零空间内强制满足理论高斯噪声幅值，以平衡结构-纹理权衡。

Result: 在BBBC021显微镜超分辨率和Edges2Shoes草图到图像任务上，OVG显著提升了生成结果的纹理真实感，同时严格保持结构一致性。

Conclusion: OVG为频谱失配下的条件扩散反演提供了有效且通用的解决方案，弥合了结构保真与纹理丰富性之间的根本矛盾。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion inversion provides a powerful framework for unpaired image-to-image translation. However, we demonstrate through an extensive analysis that standard deterministic inversion (e.g. DDIM) fails when the source domain is spectrally sparse compared to the target domain (e.g., super-resolution, sketch-to-image). In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient. Extensive experiments on microscopy super-resolution (BBBC021) and sketch-to-image (Edges2Shoes) demonstrate that OVG effectively restores photorealistic textures while preserving structural fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PCReg-Net，一种渐进式对比引导的配准框架，用于解决高速光学分辨率光声显微镜（OR-PAM）中双向扫描导致的域偏移与几何错位问题，在保持实时速度的同时显著提升配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双向光栅扫描虽可提升OR-PAM成像速度，但引入耦合的域偏移和几何错位；现有方法受限于亮度恒定假设，配准质量有限（NCC ≤ 0.96）。

Method: 提出PCReg-Net：包含四个轻量模块——粗配准U-Net、多尺度参考特征提取器、对比模块（识别残差错位）、带特征注入的精修U-Net；并设计无参考评估指标TNCC与TNCG。

Result: 在OR-PAM-Reg-4K数据集（432个测试样本）上，NCC达0.983，SSIM为0.982，PSNR为46.96 dB，较SOTA提升超14 dB，且支持实时处理。

Conclusion: PCReg-Net有效克服双向扫描中的配准挑战，兼具高精度、高效率与可评估性，推动高速OR-PAM实用化。

Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional raster scanning doubles imaging speed but introduces coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment between forward and backward scan lines. Existing methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality (NCC~$\leq 0.96$). We propose PCReg-Net, a progressive contrast-guided registration framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment through four lightweight modules: (1)~a registration U-Net for coarse alignment, (2)~a reference feature extractor capturing multi-scale structural cues, (3)~a contrast module that identifies residual misalignment by comparing coarse-registered and reference features, and (4)~a refinement U-Net with feature injection for high-fidelity output. We further propose the Temporal NCC (TNCC) and Temporal NCC Gap (TNCG) for reference-free evaluation of inter-frame temporal consistency. On OR-PAM-Reg-4K (432 test samples), PCReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.983, SSIM of 0.982, and PSNR of 46.96 dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by over 14 dB at real-time speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出WildfireVLM框架，融合YOLOv12卫星图像检测与多模态大语言模型（MLLM）进行语言驱动的风险评估，实现 wildfire的实时、可解释、可扩展监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火频发且危害加剧，但现有卫星监测受限于微弱烟雾信号、多变天气及大范围实时分析需求，亟需更智能、可解释的监测方法。

Method: 构建多源遥感影像（Landsat-8/9、GOES-16等）标注数据集；采用YOLOv12检测火点与烟羽；接入MLLM将检测结果转化为上下文化风险评估与响应建议；使用LLM-as-judge评估推理质量；部署为支持实时处理与可视化看板的服务化系统。

Result: WildfireVLM实现了高精度火点与烟羽检测，并生成可操作的风险评估与响应优先级；LLM-as-judge验证了其风险推理合理性；系统已部署并支持实时分析与长期追踪。

Conclusion: 将视觉检测与语言推理深度融合，可显著提升 wildfire 监测的准确性、可解释性与决策支持能力，为灾害管理提供新范式。

Abstract: Wildfires are a growing threat to ecosystems, human lives, and infrastructure, with their frequency and intensity rising due to climate change and human activities. Early detection is critical, yet satellite-based monitoring remains challenging due to faint smoke signals, dynamic weather conditions, and the need for real-time analysis over large areas. We introduce WildfireVLM, an AI framework that combines satellite imagery wildfire detection with language-driven risk assessment. We construct a labeled wildfire and smoke dataset using imagery from Landsat-8/9, GOES-16, and other publicly available Earth observation sources, including harmonized products with aligned spectral bands. WildfireVLM employs YOLOv12 to detect fire zones and smoke plumes, leveraging its ability to detect small, complex patterns in satellite imagery. We integrate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that convert detection outputs into contextualized risk assessments and prioritized response recommendations for disaster management. We validate the quality of risk reasoning using an LLM-as-judge evaluation with a shared rubric. The system is deployed using a service-oriented architecture that supports real-time processing, visual risk dashboards, and long-term wildfire tracking, demonstrating the value of combining computer vision with language-based reasoning for scalable wildfire monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多任务学习微调视觉语言模型Qwen2-VL-7B的自动绘画创意性评估框架，能同时输出数值评分和与评分一致的、符合五维量规（原创性、色彩、质感、构图、内容）的解释性反馈，在100分制上达到Pearson r > 0.97、MAE≈3.95，并生成语义接近专家评语的反馈（SBERT相似度0.798）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工艺术创造力评估（如TTCT）费时费力；现有机器学习方法多依赖图像特征，缺乏可解释性反馈。

Method: 使用1000幅人类绘画及其人工描述和双专家五维评分/评语数据集，微调Qwen2-VL-7B模型，添加轻量回归头预测分数，并通过系统提示嵌入量规与描述，实现分数与文本反馈联合生成。

Conclusion: 该方法成功融合计算机视觉与艺术评估，为创造力研究和教学反馈提供了可扩展、可解释的自动化工具。

Abstract: Assessing artistic creativity is foundational to creativity research and arts education, yet manual scoring (e.g., Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking) is labor-intensive at scale. Prior machine-learning approaches show promise for visual creativity scoring, but many rely mainly on image features and provide limited or no explanatory feedback. We propose a framework for automated creativity assessment of human paintings by fine-tuning the vision-language model Qwen2-VL-7B with multi-task learning. Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation). Two expert raters evaluated each work using a five-dimension rubric (originality, color, texture, composition, content) and provided written critiques; we use an 80/20 train-test split. We add a lightweight regression head on the visual encoder output so the model can predict a numerical score and generate rubric-aligned feedback in a single forward pass. By embedding the structured rubric and the artwork description in the system prompt, we constrain the generated text to match the quantitative prediction. Experiments show strong accuracy, achieving Pearson r > 0.97 and MAE about 3.95 on the 100-point scale. Qualitative evaluation indicates the generated feedback is semantically close to expert critiques (average SBERT cosine similarity = 0.798). The proposed approach bridges computer vision and art assessment and offers a scalable tool for creativity research and classroom feedback.

Motivation: 现有LLM测试时缩放法则依赖延长推理深度以激发自反思行为，但易陷入思维定式；而并行推理虽可缓解探索窄化问题，其在视觉领域的扩展仍属空白。

Method: 提出基于视觉分块的并行推理范式，设计两种策略；构建Visual Para-Thinker框架，引入Pa-Attention与LPRoPE保障路径独立性与推理多样性，并基于vLLM实现高效原生多模态并行处理。

Result: 在V*、CountBench、RefCOCO和HallusionBench等视觉基准上验证了该方法能成功将并行推理优势拓展至视觉领域，提升性能。

Conclusion: 并行思维可有效突破视觉多模态推理中的深度缩放瓶颈，Visual Para-Thinker为MLLMs提供了可扩展、多样化且高效的测试时推理新范式。

Abstract: Existing LLM test-time scaling laws emphasize the emergence of self-reflective behaviors through extended reasoning length. Nevertheless, this vertical scaling strategy often encounters plateaus in exploration as the model becomes locked into specific thinking pattern. By shifting from depth to parallelism, parallel thinking mitigates the narrowing of exploration. However, the extension of this paradigm to visual domain remains an open research question. In this paper, we first examine the role of visual partitioning in parallelized reasoning and subsequently propose two distinct strategies. Based on the above, we introduce Visual Para-Thinker, representing the inaugural parallel reasoning framework for MLLMs. To maintain path independence and promote diversity in reasoning, our approach integrates Pa-Attention alongside LPRoPE. Leveraging the vLLM framework, we have developed a native multimodal implementation that facilitates high-efficiency parallel processing. Empirical results on benchmark datasets such as V*, CountBench, RefCOCO, and HallusionBench confirm that Visual Para-Thinker successfully extends the benefits of parallel reasoning to the visual domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练、面向开放世界的时空视频定位框架ASTG，利用两个基于多模态大语言模型的智能体（空间与时间推理代理）协同完成目标时空管提取，显著降低监督需求并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STVG方法依赖帧级空间定位和强时序监督，计算冗余、标注成本高、泛化性差；弱监督方法虽降低成本，但仍受限于数据集特定的训练范式且性能不佳。

Method: 提出Agentic Spatio-Temporal Grounder (ASTG)，包含空间推理代理（SRA）和时间推理代理（TRA），基于多模态大语言模型，采用‘提出-评估’范式解耦时空推理，并引入专用视觉记忆与对话上下文以提升检索效率。

Result: 在主流基准上显著优于现有弱监督和零样本方法，性能接近部分全监督方法。

Conclusion: ASTG实现了训练无关、开放世界适配的STVG新范式，验证了基于智能体协作与大模型推理的有效性。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to retrieve the spatio-temporal tube of a target object or person in a video given a text query. Most existing approaches perform frame-wise spatial localization within a predicted temporal span, resulting in redundant computation, heavy supervision requirements, and limited generalization. Weakly-supervised variants mitigate annotation costs but remain constrained by the dataset-level train-and-fit paradigm with an inferior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Agentic Spatio-Temporal Grounder (ASTG) framework for the task of STVG towards an open-world and training-free scenario. Specifically, two specialized agents SRA (Spatial Reasoning Agent) and TRA (Temporal Reasoning Agent) constructed leveraging on modern Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) work collaboratively to retrieve the target tube in an autonomous and self-guided manner. Following a propose-and-evaluation paradigm, ASTG duly decouples spatio-temporal reasoning and automates the tube extraction, verification and temporal localization processes. With a dedicate visual memory and dialogue context, the retrieval efficiency is significantly enhanced. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach where it outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot approaches by a margin and is comparable to some of the fully-supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sim2Radar是一种从单张RGB图像端到端生成毫米波雷达训练数据的框架，通过单目深度估计、分割和视觉-语言推理重建材质感知的3D场景，并结合基于ITU-R电磁特性的物理射线追踪模拟雷达信号，显著提升了下游3D雷达目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达在低光照、烟雾等视觉退化室内环境中具有可靠感知能力，但学习型雷达感知受限于大规模雷达数据集采集与标注的稀缺性和高成本。

Method: Sim2Radar首先利用单目深度估计、语义分割和视觉-语言推理推断物体材质，构建材质感知的3D场景；再基于ITU-R电磁参数化的Fresnel反射模型，使用可配置的物理射线追踪器模拟毫米波传播，从而从单视图RGB图像直接合成雷达数据。

Result: 在真实室内场景上评估表明，用合成数据预训练雷达点云目标检测模型、再微调真实雷达数据，3D平均精度（AP, IoU=0.3）最高提升+3.7，主要源于空间定位能力增强。

Conclusion: 基于物理、由视觉驱动的雷达仿真可为雷达学习提供有效的几何先验，在真实数据有限监督下显著提升性能。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar provides reliable perception in visually degraded indoor environments (e.g., smoke, dust, and low light), but learning-based radar perception is bottlenecked by the scarcity and cost of collecting and annotating large-scale radar datasets. We present Sim2Radar, an end-to-end framework that synthesizes training radar data directly from single-view RGB images, enabling scalable data generation without manual scene modeling. Sim2Radar reconstructs a material-aware 3D scene by combining monocular depth estimation, segmentation, and vision-language reasoning to infer object materials, then simulates mmWave propagation with a configurable physics-based ray tracer using Fresnel reflection models parameterized by ITU-R electromagnetic properties. Evaluated on real-world indoor scenes, Sim2Radar improves downstream 3D radar perception via transfer learning: pre-training a radar point-cloud object detection model on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real radar yields up to +3.7 3D AP (IoU 0.3), with gains driven primarily by improved spatial localization. These results suggest that physics-based, vision-driven radar simulation can provide effective geometric priors for radar learning and measurably improve performance under limited real-data supervision.

TL;DR: 本文提出IDPruner方法，通过Maximal Marginal Relevance（MMR）算法在视觉token重要性与语义多样性之间实现帕累托最优平衡，无需注意力图，兼容FlashAttention，支持一次性剪枝，在多种模型和任务上显著提升MLLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token剪枝方法缺乏对重要性与多样性二者关系的系统分析和原则性整合框架，导致剪枝效果受限。

Method: 基于系统性分析构建重要性-多样性权衡模型，提出IDPruner，采用MMR算法实现二者帕累托最优平衡；不依赖注意力图，支持FlashAttention和one-shot剪枝。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct上，75%剪枝率下保持95.18%基线性能，90%极端剪枝率下仍达86.40%；在多架构、多基准上达到SOTA并具强泛化性。

Conclusion: IDPruner为MLLM视觉token剪枝提供了高效、通用且原理清晰的新范式，兼顾性能、效率与部署友好性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet they encounter significant computational bottlenecks due to the massive volume of visual tokens. Consequently, visual token pruning, which substantially reduces the token count, has emerged as a critical technique for accelerating MLLM inference. Existing approaches focus on token importance, diversity, or an intuitive combination of both, without a principled framework for their optimal integration. To address this issue, we first conduct a systematic analysis to characterize the trade-off between token importance and semantic diversity. Guided by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{I}mportance and \textbf{D}iversity Pruner (\textbf{IDPruner}), which leverages the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between these two objectives. Crucially, our method operates without requiring attention maps, ensuring full compatibility with FlashAttention and efficient deployment via one-shot pruning. We conduct extensive experiments across various model architectures and multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating that IDPruner achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior generalization across diverse architectures and tasks. Notably, on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, IDPruner retains 95.18\% of baseline performance when pruning 75\% of the tokens, and still maintains 86.40\% even under an extreme 90\% pruning ratio.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PolyShapes-Ideal（PSI）数据集，用于评估模型对拓扑不变性的学习能力，并验证了Eidos架构在结构约束下泛化能力源于几何完整性而非统计规模的‘形式优先’假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基准过度依赖纹理相关性，难以评估模型对拓扑不变性（即在仿射变换下保持结构恒定的能力）的学习能力，因此需要专门设计的诊断性基准。

Method: 构建PSI数据集，包含三个诊断任务：带噪声的多边形分类、MNIST到30种未见字体的零样本迁移、以及渐进形变下的几何坍缩映射；并采用Eidos架构进行评估。

Result: Eidos在PSI上达到>99%准确率，在30种未见字体上实现81.67%的零样本迁移准确率，且无需预训练。

Conclusion: 实验结果支持‘形式优先’假说，即结构受限架构的泛化能力源于其对几何完整性的保持，而非依赖大规模统计学习。

Abstract: We present the PolyShapes-Ideal (PSI) dataset, a suite of diagnostic benchmarks designed to isolate topological invariance -- the ability to maintain structural identity across affine transformations -- from the textural correlations that dominate standard vision benchmarks. Through three diagnostic probes (polygon classification under noise, zero-shot font transfer from MNIST, and geometric collapse mapping under progressive deformation), we demonstrate that the Eidos architecture achieves >99% accuracy on PSI and 81.67% zero-shot transfer across 30 unseen typefaces without pre-training. These results validate the "Form-First" hypothesis: generalization in structurally constrained architectures is a property of geometric integrity, not statistical scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主边缘机器人在动态军事环境中因领域特定训练数据稀缺和边缘硬件算力受限而难以部署的问题。

Method: 构建分层零样本框架：以Grounding DINO作为高召回率文本可提示区域提议器，将高置信度检测帧送入轻量级Qwen/Gemma系列VLM（4B–12B参数）进行语义验证；进一步扩展为Scout-Commander智能体工作流，并提出'受控输入'方法解耦感知与推理以分析模型失效模式。

Result: 在Battlefield 6合成视频上实现虚假正例过滤达100%准确率、损伤评估达97.5%、细粒度车辆分类55–90%；Scout-Commander工作流达成100%正确资产部署与9.8/10 GPT-4o推理评分，延迟<75秒；'受控输入'揭示Gemma3-12B擅长战术逻辑但感知弱，Gemma3-4B则存在推理崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 分层零样本架构适用于边缘自主系统，且'受控输入'方法为安全关键应用中VLM的选型与认证提供了可解释的诊断框架。

Abstract: Deploying autonomous edge robotics in dynamic military environments is constrained by both scarce domain-specific training data and the computational limits of edge hardware. This paper introduces a hierarchical, zero-shot framework that cascades lightweight object detection with compact Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from the Qwen and Gemma families (4B-12B parameters). Grounding DINO serves as a high-recall, text-promptable region proposer, and frames with high detection confidence are passed to edge-class VLMs for semantic verification. We evaluate this pipeline on 55 high-fidelity synthetic videos from Battlefield 6 across three tasks: false-positive filtering (up to 100% accuracy), damage assessment (up to 97.5%), and fine-grained vehicle classification (55-90%). We further extend the pipeline into an agentic Scout-Commander workflow, achieving 100% correct asset deployment and a 9.8/10 reasoning score (graded by GPT-4o) with sub-75-second latency. A novel "Controlled Input" methodology decouples perception from reasoning, revealing distinct failure phenotypes: Gemma3-12B excels at tactical logic but fails in visual perception, while Gemma3-4B exhibits reasoning collapse even with accurate inputs. These findings validate hierarchical zero-shot architectures for edge autonomy and provide a diagnostic framework for certifying VLM suitability in safety-critical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色图像动画方法主要局限于单人场景，难以泛化至多人形角色共存、交互复杂且频繁遮挡的多角色场景。

Method: 提出两种创新：1）统一运动表征，解耦身份无关运动并显式绑定至对应角色；2）整体4D锚定范式，在共享4D空间中融合运动表征与视频潜变量，并引入分层4D级监督。基于此构建端到端框架MotionWeaver，并发布46小时多角色视频数据集及300视频评测基准。

Conclusion: MotionWeaver有效解决了多角色图像动画的关键瓶颈，为复杂人形协同动画提供了新范式与实用工具。

Abstract: Character image animation, which synthesizes videos of reference characters driven by pose sequences, has advanced rapidly but remains largely limited to single-human settings. Existing methods struggle to generalize to multi-humanoid scenarios, which involve diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and frequent occlusions. We address this gap with two key innovations. First, we introduce unified motion representations that extract identity-agnostic motions and explicitly bind them to corresponding characters, enabling generalization across diverse humanoid forms and seamless extension to multi-humanoid scenarios. Second, we propose a holistic 4D-anchored paradigm that constructs a shared 4D space to fuse motion representations with video latents, and further reinforces this process with hierarchical 4D-level supervision to better handle interactions and occlusions. We instantiate these ideas in MotionWeaver, an end-to-end framework for multi-humanoid image animation. To support this setting, we curate a 46-hour dataset of multi-human videos with rich interactions, and construct a 300-video benchmark featuring paired humanoid characters. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MotionWeaver not only achieves state-of-the-art results on our benchmark but also generalizes effectively across diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and challenging multi-humanoid scenarios.

Conclusion: HiST-VLA显著提升了VLA模型在自动驾驶任务中的空间接地性、时间一致性与可靠性，为安全关键应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer promising capabilities for autonomous driving through multimodal understanding. However, their utilization in safety-critical scenarios is constrained by inherent limitations, including imprecise numerical reasoning, weak 3D spatial awareness, and high sensitivity to context. To address these challenges, we propose HiST-VLA, a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal VLA model designed for reliable trajectory generation.
  Our framework enhances 3D spatial and temporal reasoning by integrating geometric awareness with fine-grained driving commands and state history prompting. To ensure computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic token sparsification into the VLA architecture. This approach fuses redundant tokens rather than filtering them, effectively reducing redundancy without sacrificing model performance. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence. Extensive evaluation on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Navtest, achieving an EPDMS of 88.6, and EPDMS of 50.9 on pseudo closed-loop Navhard benchmark.

Motivation: 现有视频多模态大模型在处理长时程临床视频时缺乏对时间定位证据的主动检索与验证能力，难以支撑可信的循证决策。

Method: 提出MedScope模型，结合工具调用与中间推理进行粗到细的证据定位；构建ClinVideoSuite数据集；采用接地感知分组相对策略优化（GA-GRPO）训练方法。

Result: 在多个全视频与细粒度理解基准上达到SOTA性能，涵盖域内与跨域评估。

Conclusion: MedScope实现了真正‘以视频为思考媒介’的医学AI代理范式，推动临床视频理解向可解释、可验证、可信赖方向发展。

Abstract: Long-form clinical videos are central to visual evidence-based decision-making, with growing importance for applications such as surgical robotics and related settings. However, current multimodal large language models typically process videos with passive sampling or weakly grounded inspection, which limits their ability to iteratively locate, verify, and justify predictions with temporally targeted evidence. To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite. We then optimize MedScope with Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO), which directly reinforces tool use with grounding-aligned rewards and evidence-weighted advantages. On full and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, MedScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with videos" through tool-integrated reasoning. We will release our code, models, and data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种协同推理框架，结合边缘轻量级通用ViT与近边缘中型专家ViT，通过动态路由和渐进式专家训练提升准确率并降低延迟与能耗。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer在边缘设备部署面临高计算复杂度问题，而完全卸载至云端又带来显著延迟开销。

Method: 提出协同推理框架：边缘端部署轻量级通用ViT，近边缘端部署多个中型专家ViT；设计基于Top-k预测的动态路由机制选择最相关专家；采用渐进式专家训练策略提升子集上的专家精度。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上实验表明，该训练策略使专家在目标子集上准确率提升4.12%，整体准确率提升2.76%；相比纯边缘执行延迟降低最多45%，相比纯近边缘卸载能耗降低最多46%。

Conclusion: 所提协同框架在保持高精度的同时显著优化了边缘AI推理的延迟与能效，验证了动态路由与渐进训练的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying Vision Transformers on edge devices is challenging due to their high computational complexity, while full offloading to cloud resources presents significant latency overheads. We propose a novel collaborative inference framework, which orchestrates a lightweight generalist ViT on an edge device and multiple medium-sized expert ViTs on a near-edge accelerator. A novel routing mechanism uses the edge model's Top-$\mathit{k}$ predictions to dynamically select the most relevant expert for samples with low confidence. We further design a progressive specialist training strategy to enhance expert accuracy on dataset subsets. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset using a real-world edge and near-edge testbed demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Specifically, the proposed training strategy improves expert specialization accuracy by 4.12% on target subsets and enhances overall accuracy by 2.76% over static experts. Moreover, our method reduces latency by up to 45% compared to edge execution, and energy consumption by up to 46% compared to just near-edge offload.

Motivation: 脑膜瘤的生物学行为和治疗反应依赖其病理分级，准确诊断对治疗规划和预后评估至关重要；而现有方法在少样本条件下难以有效利用多频带信息。

Method: 提出一种自适应加权的空间-频率域特征融合网络（AMSF-Net），结合离散小波变换提取多频带特征，并动态学习各频带与空间域特征的权重；构建新脑膜瘤MRI数据集验证方法。

Result: 在三个数据集上，该方法性能优于当前主流少样本学习方法；新公开MRI数据集及代码将增强可复现性。

Conclusion: 自适应频带加权融合策略能有效提升少样本脑膜瘤MRI分级性能，为临床辅助诊断提供新思路。

Abstract: The biological behavior and treatment response of meningiomas depend on their grade, making an accurate diagnosis essential for treatment planning and prognosis assessment. We observed that the weighted fusion of spatial-frequency domain features significantly influences meningioma classification performance. Notably, the contribution of specific frequency bands obtained by discrete wavelet transform varies considerably across different images. A feature fusion architecture with adaptive weights of different frequency band information and spatial domain information is proposed for few-shot meningioma learning. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a new MRI dataset of meningiomas is introduced. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with existing state-of-the-art methods in three datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合语义分割与双重机器学习的因果推断框架，利用街景图像量化视觉环境特征（尤其是绿化率）对区域交通事故的因果效应，发现绿化具有显著且稳健的负向因果效应，并呈现空间异质性，但对弱势道路使用者保护效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有宏观交通安全建模多依赖静态社会人口与基础设施指标，忽视驾驶员对驾驶环境的视觉感知影响；虽有观察性证据表明视觉环境影响交通安全，但缺乏在复杂空间环境下支持政策评估的稳健因果证据。

Method: 基于Google街景图像应用语义分割提取视觉环境特征；构建Double Machine Learning框架估计因果效应；使用SHAP值解析混杂变量的非线性影响机制；采用因果森林估计条件平均处理效应。

Result: 绿化比例对区域交通事故具有显著负向因果效应（ATE = -6.38, p = 0.005），该效应在人口稠密、社会脆弱性强的城市核心区最显著；绿化显著降低侧撞与追尾事故，但对弱势道路使用者（VRUs）保护作用有限。

Conclusion: 本研究为‘绿色化’作为交通安全干预措施提供了因果证据，建议优先优化高风险视觉环境，同时需针对VRUs设计差异化景观策略。

Abstract: Macroscopic traffic safety modeling aims to identify critical risk factors for regional crashes, thereby informing targeted policy interventions for safety improvement. However, current approaches rely heavily on static sociodemographic and infrastructure metrics, frequently overlooking the impacts from drivers' visual perception of driving environment. Although visual environment features have been found to impact driving and traffic crashes, existing evidence remains largely observational, failing to establish the robust causality for traffic policy evaluation under complex spatial environment. To fill these gaps, we applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View imageries to extract visual environmental features and proposed a Double Machine Learning framework to quantify their causal effects on regional crashes. Meanwhile, we utilized SHAP values to characterize the nonlinear influence mechanisms of confounding variables in the models and applied causal forests to estimate conditional average treatment effects. Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores. While greenery significantly mitigates angle and rear-end crashes, its protective benefit for vulnerable road users (VRUs) remains limited. Our findings provide causal evidence for greening as a potential safety intervention, prioritizing hazardous visual environments while highlighting the need for distinct design optimizations to protect VRUs.

Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在数据质量、训练稳定性、指令对齐性、身份保持及细粒度控制（如文本编辑）等方面仍存在不足，缺乏统一、全面的评估基准。

Method: 构建1.6B样本高质量多源数据集（经清洗、分层、自动标注与两阶段过滤保留100M样本）；提出多阶段训练流程（预训练→监督微调→强化学习）；引入多条件感知桶采样、随机指令对齐、非对称梯度DPO优化、DiffusionNFT（结合OCR奖励）、可微一致性损失等关键技术。

Result: 在自建REDEdit-Bench（含15类任务，新增美化与低级增强）及公开基准（ImgEdit、GEdit）上均取得领先或媲美SOTA的性能；模型具备更强的指令遵循性、文本编辑准确性和身份保持能力。

Conclusion: 系统性工程优化（数据、训练、评估）比单纯扩大模型规模更能提升图像编辑性能；所提方法与基准为该领域提供了可复现、可扩展的新范式。

Abstract: We present FireRed-Image-Edit, a diffusion transformer for instruction-based image editing that achieves state-of-the-art performance through systematic optimization of data curation, training methodology, and evaluation design. We construct a 1.6B-sample training corpus, comprising 900M text-to-image and 700M image editing pairs from diverse sources. After rigorous cleaning, stratification, auto-labeling, and two-stage filtering, we retain over 100M high-quality samples balanced between generation and editing, ensuring strong semantic coverage and instruction alignment. Our multi-stage training pipeline progressively builds editing capability via pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. To improve data efficiency, we introduce a Multi-Condition Aware Bucket Sampler for variable-resolution batching and Stochastic Instruction Alignment with dynamic prompt re-indexing. To stabilize optimization and enhance controllability, we propose Asymmetric Gradient Optimization for DPO, DiffusionNFT with layout-aware OCR rewards for text editing, and a differentiable Consistency Loss for identity preservation. We further establish REDEdit-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 15 editing categories, including newly introduced beautification and low-level enhancement tasks. Extensive experiments on REDEdit-Bench and public benchmarks (ImgEdit and GEdit) demonstrate competitive or superior performance against both open-source and proprietary systems. We release code, models, and the benchmark suite to support future research.

Motivation: 自动化仓库需要在实际执行前预测存储箱在堆垛操作后的状态，以提升规划效率与准确性。

Method: 提出FOREST模型，将箱体状态表示为物品对齐的实例掩码，并采用潜在扩散Transformer，以当前观测与堆垛意图为条件预测堆垛后的配置。

Result: FOREST在预测后堆垛布局的几何一致性上显著优于启发式基线；在负载质量评估与多步堆垛推理两个下游任务中，使用预测掩码替代真实掩码仅带来轻微性能下降。

Conclusion: FOREST能有效提供高质量的堆垛后状态预测，为仓储系统规划提供可靠的前瞻性信号。

Abstract: Automated warehouses execute millions of stow operations, where robots place objects into storage bins. For these systems it is valuable to anticipate how a bin will look from the current observations and the planned stow behavior before real execution. We propose FOREST, a stow-intent-conditioned world model that represents bin states as item-aligned instance masks and uses a latent diffusion transformer to predict the post-stow configuration from the observed context. Our evaluation shows that FOREST substantially improves the geometric agreement between predicted and true post-stow layouts compared with heuristic baselines. We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have made significant strides, producing impressive results in generating images from textual descriptions. However, creating a scalable pipeline for deploying these models in production remains a challenge. Achieving the right balance between automation and human feedback is critical to maintain both scale and quality. While automation can handle large volumes, human oversight is still an essential component to ensure that the generated images meet the desired standards and are aligned with the creative vision. This paper presents a new pipeline that offers a fully automated, scalable solution for generating marketing images of commercial products using text-to-image models. The proposed system maintains the quality and fidelity of images, while also introducing sufficient creative variation to adhere to marketing guidelines. By streamlining this process, we ensure a seamless blend of efficiency and human oversight, achieving a $30.77\%$ increase in marketing object fidelity using DINOV2 and a $52.00\%$ increase in human preference over the generated outcome.

Abstract: Brick kilns are a major source of air pollution and forced labor in South Asia, yet large-scale monitoring remains limited by sparse and outdated ground data. We study brick kiln detection at scale using high-resolution satellite imagery and curate a multi city zoom-20 (0.149 meters per pixel) resolution dataset comprising over 1.3 million image tiles across five regions in South and Central Asia. We propose ClimateGraph, a region-adaptive graph-based model that captures spatial and directional structure in kiln layouts, and evaluate it against established graph learning baselines. In parallel, we assess a remote sensing based detection pipeline and benchmark it against recent foundation models for satellite imagery. Our results highlight complementary strengths across graph, foundation, and remote sensing approaches, providing practical guidance for scalable brick kiln monitoring from satellite imagery.

Abstract: Automated image captioning using the content from the image is very appealing when done by harnessing the capability of computer vision and natural language processing. Extensive research has been done in the field with a major focus on the English language which gives the scope for further developments in the same with consideration of popular foreign languages. This research utilizes distinct models for translating the image caption into Hindi, the fourth most popular language across the world. Exploring the multi-modal architectures this research comprises local visual features, global visual features, attention mechanisms, and pre-trained models. Using google cloud translator on the image dataset from Flickr8k, Hindi image descriptions have been generated. Pre-trained CNNs like VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 helped in retrieving image characteristics, while the uni-directional and bi-directional techniques of text encoding are used for the text encoding process. An additional Attention layer helps to generate a weight vector and, by multiplying it, combine image characteristics from each time step into a sentence-level feature vector. Bilingual evaluation understudy scores are used to compare the research outcome. Many experiments that serve as a baseline are done for the comparative analysis of the research. An image with a score of BLEU-1 is considered sufficient, whereas one with a score of BLEU-4 is considered to have fluid image captioning. For both BLEU scores, the attention-based bidirectional LSTM with VGG16 produced the best results of 0.59 and 0.19 respectively. The experiments conclude that researchs ability to produce relevant, semantically accurate image captions in Hindi. The research accomplishes the goals and future research can be guided by this research model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出AdaCorrection框架，通过轻量级时空信号动态评估缓存有效性，并自适应融合缓存与新鲜激活值，以在保持高质量生成的同时提升DiT推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers（DiTs）因迭代去噪结构导致推理开销大；现有缓存加速方法依赖静态重用策略或粗粒度启发式，易引发时间漂移和缓存错位，损害生成质量。

Method: AdaCorrection是一种自适应偏置缓存校正框架：在每个时间步，利用轻量级时空信号估计缓存有效性，并实时自适应地混合缓存激活与新鲜激活；无需额外监督或重训练。

Result: 在图像与视频扩散基准实验中，AdaCorrection在保持接近原始FID的前提下实现适度加速，并持续提升生成性能。

Conclusion: AdaCorrection在不牺牲生成保真度的前提下，实现了高效、自适应的缓存重用，为DiT推理加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity image and video generation but suffer from expensive inference due to their iterative denoising structure. While prior methods accelerate sampling by caching intermediate features, they rely on static reuse schedules or coarse-grained heuristics, which often lead to temporal drift and cache misalignment that significantly degrade generation quality. We introduce \textbf{AdaCorrection}, an adaptive offset cache correction framework that maintains high generation fidelity while enabling efficient cache reuse across Transformer layers during diffusion inference. At each timestep, AdaCorrection estimates cache validity with lightweight spatio-temporal signals and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations. This correction is computed on-the-fly without additional supervision or retraining. Our approach achieves strong generation quality with minimal computational overhead, maintaining near-original FID while providing moderate acceleration. Experiments on image and video diffusion benchmarks show that AdaCorrection consistently improves generation performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BIS方法在强噪声和非线性混合下存在估计偏差、纹理失真和伪影残留问题，难以刻画真实场景中复杂的特征分布。

Method: 引入扩散模型到双通道盲图像分离中，提出DCDSM；设计Wavelet Suppression Module（WSM）嵌入双分支反向去噪过程，利用源图像间噪声耦合特性增强细节分离。

Result: 在合成数据集上，DCDSM在雨/雪去除任务中PSNR分别达35.0023 dB / 29.8108 dB，SSIM达0.9549 / 0.9243；在复杂混合分离中平均PSNR和SSIM达25.0049 dB和0.7997，显著优于Histoformer、LDRCNet等对比方法。

Conclusion: DCDSM有效提升了盲图像分离在强干扰下的鲁棒性与细节保真度，验证了扩散模型与小波先验协同建模在BIS任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Blind image separation (BIS) refers to the inverse problem of simultaneously estimating and restoring multiple independent source images from a single observation image under conditions of unknown mixing mode and without prior knowledge of the source images. Traditional methods relying on statistical independence assumptions or CNN/GAN variants struggle to characterize complex feature distributions in real scenes, leading to estimation bias, texture distortion, and artifact residue under strong noise and nonlinear mixing. This paper innovatively introduces diffusion models into dual-channel BIS, proposing an efficient Dual-Channel Diffusion Separation Model (DCDSM). DCDSM leverages diffusion models' powerful generative capability to learn source image feature distributions and reconstruct feature structures effectively. A novel Wavelet Suppression Module (WSM) is designed within the dual-branch reverse denoising process, forming an interactive separation network that enhances detail separation by exploiting the mutual coupling noise characteristic between source images. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets containing rain/snow and complex mixtures demonstrate that DCDSM achieves state-of-the-art performance: 1) In image restoration tasks, it obtains PSNR/SSIM values of 35.0023 dB/0.9549 and 29.8108 dB/0.9243 for rain and snow removal respectively, outperforming Histoformer and LDRCNet by 1.2570 dB/0.9272 dB (PSNR) and 0.0262/0.0289 (SSIM) on average; 2) For complex mixture separation, the restored dual-source images achieve average PSNR and SSIM of 25.0049 dB and 0.7997, surpassing comparative methods by 4.1249 dB and 0.0926. Both subjective and objective evaluations confirm DCDSM's superiority in addressing rain/snow residue removal and detail preservation challenges.

Motivation: 在生产环境中，文档处理流程中使用的视觉-语言模型需处理无真实标签的任意输入，导致难以评估生成代码的质量。

Method: 提出参考-free评估框架，定义Recall_OCR（基于OCR提取文本估计内容覆盖）和Precision_VE（基于视觉蕴含检测幻觉元素），并以二者调和平均F1_OCR-VE作为统一质量分。

Conclusion: 所提框架是一种可靠、实用的参考-free质量监控方案，适用于VLM在生产环境中的持续评估。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in document processing pipelines to convert flowchart images into structured code (e.g., Mermaid). In production, these systems process arbitrary inputs for which no ground-truth code exists, making output quality difficult to assess. We propose a reference-free evaluation framework that monitors flowchart image-to-code generation quality at inference time, using only the input image and the generated output. The framework introduces two automated metrics: $\text{Recall}{\text{OCR}}$, which estimates content coverage by extracting text from the input image via OCR as a proxy reference, and $\text{Precision}{\text{VE}}$, which detects hallucinated elements through Visual Entailment against the original image. Their harmonic mean, $\text{F1}{\text{OCR-VE}}$, provides a unified quality score. Validation on the FlowVQA dataset shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics (average Pearson's $r = 0.97$, $0.91$, and $0.94$ for Recall, Precision, and F1, respectively), confirming the framework's reliability as a practical, reference-free alternative for continuous quality monitoring in production settings.

Motivation: 现有检测器难以应对无人机图像中目标像素少、背景杂乱、遮挡严重及机载计算资源受限等挑战。

Method: 在YOLOv10n基础上引入：1）Partial Convolution C2f（PC-C2f）模块降低骨干网冗余计算；2）Attention-Guided FPN（AG-FPN）结合SE通道门控与DySample插值提升多尺度特征融合；3）新增P2检测头（160×160分辨率）增强超小目标定位能力并移除P5头以重分配参数；4）采用Wise-IoU v3替代CIoU缓解密集场景标注噪声对回归的影响。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles serve as primary sensing platforms for surveillance, traffic monitoring, and disaster response, making aerial object detection a central problem in applied computer vision. Current detectors struggle with UAV-specific challenges: targets spanning only a few pixels, cluttered backgrounds, heavy occlusion, and strict onboard computational budgets. This study introduces LAF-YOLOv10, built on YOLOv10n, integrating four complementary techniques to improve small-object detection in drone imagery. A Partial Convolution C2f (PC-C2f) module restricts spatial convolution to one quarter of backbone channels, reducing redundant computation while preserving discriminative capacity. An Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid Network (AG-FPN) inserts Squeeze-and-Excitation channel gates before multi-scale fusion and replaces nearest-neighbor upsampling with DySample for content-aware interpolation. An auxiliary P2 detection head at 160$\times$160 resolution extends localization to objects below 8$\times$8 pixels, while the P5 head is removed to redistribute parameters. Wise-IoU v3 replaces CIoU for bounding box regression, attenuating gradients from noisy annotations in crowded aerial scenes. The four modules address non-overlapping bottlenecks: PC-C2f compresses backbone computation, AG-FPN refines cross-scale fusion, the P2 head recovers spatial resolution, and Wise-IoU stabilizes regression under label noise. No individual component is novel; the contribution is the joint integration within a single YOLOv10 framework. Across three training runs (seeds 42, 123, 256), LAF-YOLOv10 achieves 35.1$\pm$0.3\% mAP@0.5 on VisDrone-DET2019 with 2.3\,M parameters, exceeding YOLOv10n by 3.3 points. Cross-dataset evaluation on UAVDT yields 35.8$\pm$0.4\% mAP@0.5. Benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano confirm 24.3 FPS at FP16, demonstrating viability for embedded UAV deployment.

Conclusion: 任务定制化方法可有效应对CXR中长尾监督与零样本OOD识别问题，具备临床落地潜力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) classification in clinical practice is often limited by imperfect supervision, arising from (i) extreme long-tailed multi-label disease distributions and (ii) missing annotations for rare or previously unseen findings. The CXR-LT 2026 challenge addresses these issues on a PadChest-based benchmark with a 36-class label space split into 30 in-distribution classes for training and 6 out-of-distribution (OOD) classes for zero-shot evaluation. We present task-specific solutions tailored to the distinct supervision regimes. For Task 1 (long-tailed multi-label classification), we adopt an imbalance-aware multi-label learning strategy to improve recognition of tail classes while maintaining stable performance on frequent findings. For Task 2 (zero-shot OOD recognition), we propose a prediction approach that produces scores for unseen disease categories without using any supervised labels or examples from the OOD classes during training. Evaluated with macro-averaged mean Average Precision (mAP), our method achieves strong performance on both tasks, ranking first on the public leaderboard of the development phase.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向室内无人机的类增量学习（CIL）方法，构建了包含14,400帧、具有时间一致性的室内UAV视频数据集，并在资源受限的边缘平台上评估了三种回放式CIL策略（ER、MIR、FAR），其中FAR在5%回放预算下取得82.96%平均精度；同时通过Grad-CAM揭示了注意力偏移对定位质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内无人机需实时学习新物体类别并缓解灾难性遗忘，但现有UAV数据集多为室外场景且缺乏时间连贯的室内视频。

Method: 构建半自动标注的室内UAV视频数据集（14,400帧，98.6%首过标注一致性），采用YOLOv11-nano作为轻量检测器，在5–10%极小回放内存预算下对比ER、MIR和FAR三种回放式CIL策略，并结合Grad-CAM分析注意力变化。

Result: FAR在5%回放下达到82.96%平均精度（mAP50-95），优于ER和MIR；Grad-CAM显示跨类注意力偏移会降低无人机定位质量；验证了回放式CIL可在边缘空中系统上有效部署。

Conclusion: 本文贡献了一个具时间一致性的室内UAV视频数据集，并证明在严苛内存约束下，FAR等回放式CIL策略可有效支持无人机在线持续学习，为边缘空中智能提供可行路径。

Abstract: Autonomous agents such as indoor drones must learn new object classes in real-time while limiting catastrophic forgetting, motivating Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). However, most unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) datasets focus on outdoor scenes and offer limited temporally coherent indoor videos. We introduce an indoor dataset of $14,400$ frames capturing inter-drone and ground vehicle footage, annotated via a semi-automatic workflow with a $98.6\%$ first-pass labeling agreement before final manual verification. Using this dataset, we benchmark 3 replay-based CIL strategies: Experience Replay (ER), Maximally Interfered Retrieval (MIR), and Forgetting-Aware Replay (FAR), using YOLOv11-nano as a resource-efficient detector for deployment-constrained UAV platforms. Under tight memory budgets ($5-10\%$ replay), FAR performs better than the rest, achieving an average accuracy (ACC, $mAP_{50-95}$ across increments) of $82.96\%$ with $5\%$ replay. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) analysis shows attention shifts across classes in mixed scenes, which is associated with reduced localization quality for drones. The experiments further demonstrate that replay-based continual learning can be effectively applied to edge aerial systems. Overall, this work contributes an indoor UAV video dataset with preserved temporal coherence and an evaluation of replay-based CIL under limited replay budgets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对可穿戴设备的视频文本VQA系统，通过混合架构（本地高分辨率OCR + 低分辨率视频流）解决功耗与文本识别精度的矛盾，在保持72%准确率的同时将功耗降至全分辨率流的0.49倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可穿戴设备上部署文本VQA面临高分辨率视频流导致的高功耗与热节流问题，且现有模型难以在实时视频流中维持跨帧的连贯时序上下文。

Method: 利用文本识别（需高分辨率）与场景理解（可容忍低分辨率）的分辨率需求不对称性，设计混合架构：设备端执行选择性高分辨率OCR，同时传输低分辨率视频以提供视觉上下文。

Result: 在涵盖五类任务的文本VQA基准上达到72%准确率，功耗仅为全分辨率流的0.49倍，支持资源受限可穿戴设备上的持续VQA会话。

Conclusion: 该混合分辨率策略有效平衡了文本理解质量与能效，为可穿戴设备上的实时视觉语言推理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in understanding and reasoning about visual content, particularly in tasks involving text recognition and text-based visual question answering (Text VQA). However, deploying Text VQA on wearable devices faces a fundamental tension: text recognition requires high-resolution video, but streaming high-quality video drains battery and causes thermal throttling. Moreover, existing models struggle to maintain coherent temporal context when processing text across multiple frames in real-time streams. We observe that text recognition and visual reasoning have asymmetric resolution requirements - OCR needs fine detail while scene understanding tolerates coarse features. We exploit this asymmetry with a hybrid architecture that performs selective high-resolution OCR on-device while streaming low-resolution video for visual context. On a benchmark of text-based VQA samples across five task categories, our system achieves 72% accuracy at 0.49x the power consumption of full-resolution streaming, enabling sustained VQA sessions on resource-constrained wearables without sacrificing text understanding quality.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了七种视频基础模型（VFMs）在帕金森病远程视频筛查中的表现，发现不同模型在不同临床任务（如言语、面部表情、上肢运动、指敲）中各具优势，并指出高特异性但低敏感性问题，为远程神经监测提供了模型与任务匹配的实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PD视频评估依赖手工特征，而新兴视频基础模型（VFMs）无需任务定制即可学习表征；但尚不清楚不同VFM架构在多样化临床任务中的相对有效性。

Method: 构建包含1888名参与者（727例PD）、32847个视频、覆盖16项标准化临床任务的大规模新数据集；在冻结VFM特征提取器的前提下，采用线性分类头对七种SOTA VFM（如VideoPrism、V-JEPA、TimeSformer等）进行统一评估。

Result: VideoPrism在无音频的言语运动和面部表情任务中最优，V-JEPA在上肢运动任务中最佳，TimeSformer在节律性任务（如指敲）中表现突出；AUC达76.4–85.3%，准确率71.5–80.6%，特异性高达90.3%，但敏感性仅43.2–57.3%。

Conclusion: VFM性能高度依赖于具体临床任务，单一模型无法普适；需任务感知校准及多任务、多模态融合以提升敏感性；本工作为VFM驱动的PD远程筛查建立了严格基线与选型路线图。

Abstract: Remote, video-based assessments offer a scalable pathway for Parkinson's disease (PD) screening. While traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features mimicking clinical scales, recent advances in video foundation models (VFMs) enable representation learning without task-specific customization. However, the comparative effectiveness of different VFM architectures across diverse clinical tasks remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale systematic study using a novel video dataset from 1,888 participants (727 with PD), comprising 32,847 videos across 16 standardized clinical tasks. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art VFMs -- including VideoPrism, V-JEPA, ViViT, and VideoMAE -- to determine their robustness in clinical screening. By evaluating frozen embeddings with a linear classification head, we demonstrate that task saliency is highly model-dependent: VideoPrism excels in capturing visual speech kinematics (no audio) and facial expressivity, while V-JEPA proves superior for upper-limb motor tasks. Notably, TimeSformer remains highly competitive for rhythmic tasks like finger tapping. Our experiments yield AUCs of 76.4-85.3% and accuracies of 71.5-80.6%. While high specificity (up to 90.3%) suggests strong potential for ruling out healthy individuals, the lower sensitivity (43.2-57.3%) highlights the need for task-aware calibration and integration of multiple tasks and modalities. Overall, this work establishes a rigorous baseline for VFM-based PD screening and provides a roadmap for selecting suitable tasks and architectures in remote neurological monitoring.

TL;DR: 本文提出SpargeAttention2，一种可训练的稀疏注意力方法，通过混合掩码规则、高效实现和蒸馏启发的微调目标，在保持生成质量的同时实现高达95%的注意力稀疏度和16.2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练自由稀疏注意力方法虽有效，但可训练稀疏注意力能进一步提升稀疏度；然而其掩码规则失效场景、高稀疏性原理及扩散损失微调局限尚不明确。

Method: 提出SpargeAttention2：(i)融合Top-k与Top-p的混合掩码规则以增强高稀疏下的鲁棒性；(ii)高效可训练稀疏注意力实现；(iii)基于蒸馏思想的微调目标以更好保持生成质量。

Result: 在视频扩散模型上实现95%注意力稀疏度和16.2倍注意力加速，同时维持生成质量，持续优于先前稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: SpargeAttention2通过理论分析驱动的设计，在稀疏性与生成质量间取得更好平衡，揭示了可训练稀疏注意力的关键机制与优化路径。

Abstract: Many training-free sparse attention methods are effective for accelerating diffusion models. Recently, several works suggest that making sparse attention trainable can further increase sparsity while preserving generation quality. We study three key questions: (1) when do the two common masking rules, i.e., Top-k and Top-p, fail, and how can we avoid these failures? (2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them? Based on this analysis, we propose SpargeAttention2, a trainable sparse attention method that achieves high sparsity without degrading generation quality. SpargeAttention2 includes (i) a hybrid masking rule that combines Top-k and Top-p for more robust masking at high sparsity, (ii) an efficient trainable sparse attention implementation, and (iii) a distillation-inspired fine-tuning objective to better preserve generation quality during fine-tuning using sparse attention. Experiments on video diffusion models show that SpargeAttention2 reaches 95% attention sparsity and a 16.2x attention speedup while maintaining generation quality, consistently outperforming prior sparse attention methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将物理渲染融入3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的新方法，用于提升自动驾驶夜间场景的重建质量与实时渲染能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF和3DGS方法在正常光照下表现良好，但在复杂光照与外观的低光夜间驾驶场景中性能显著下降。

Method: 将物理渲染引入3DGS，联合优化基于BRDF的材质属性；通过全局光照模块显式建模漫反射分量，用各向异性球面高斯建模镜面反射分量。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo两个真实自动驾驶数据集的多种夜间场景上，定量与定性结果均优于当前最优方法，同时保持实时渲染能力。

Conclusion: 融合物理渲染的3DGS方法能有效提升夜间驾驶场景的重建质量与真实性，为低光条件下的自动驾驶仿真提供新思路。

Abstract: This paper focuses on scene reconstruction under nighttime conditions in autonomous driving simulation. Recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved photorealistic modeling in autonomous driving scene reconstruction, but they primarily focus on normal-light conditions. Low-light driving scenes are more challenging to model due to their complex lighting and appearance conditions, which often causes performance degradation of existing methods. To address this problem, this work presents a novel approach that integrates physically based rendering into 3DGS to enhance nighttime scene reconstruction for autonomous driving. Specifically, our approach integrates physically based rendering into composite scene Gaussian representations and jointly optimizes Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) based material properties. We explicitly model diffuse components through a global illumination module and specular components by anisotropic spherical Gaussians. As a result, our approach improves reconstruction quality for outdoor nighttime driving scenes, while maintaining real-time rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse nighttime scenarios on two real-world autonomous driving datasets, including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向鸟瞰图（BEV）语义分割的隐私隐藏协同感知框架（PCC），通过对抗学习使共享的BEV特征难以被重构原始图像，同时保持良好的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协同感知系统在提升感知范围的同时，存在因共享传感数据而导致敏感视觉内容被重建的隐私泄露风险。

Method: 设计了一个隐藏网络与图像重建网络进行对抗训练：隐藏网络试图抹除BEV特征中的视觉线索，重建网络则尝试恢复原始图像；感知网络与隐藏网络端到端联合优化。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著降低了重建图像质量，对语义分割性能影响极小，有效保护了协作车辆的视觉隐私。

Conclusion: PCC框架在保障BEV语义分割精度的前提下，实现了对共享特征中隐私信息的有效隐藏，为自动驾驶协同感知提供了可行的隐私保护方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception systems for autonomous driving aim to overcome the limited perception range of a single vehicle by communicating with adjacent agents to share sensing information. While this improves perception performance, these systems also face a significant privacy-leakage issue, as sensitive visual content can potentially be reconstructed from the shared data. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Concealing Cooperation (PCC) framework for Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation. Based on commonly shared BEV features, we design a hiding network to prevent an image reconstruction network from recovering the input images from the shared features. An adversarial learning mechanism is employed to train the network, where the hiding network works to conceal the visual clues in the BEV features while the reconstruction network attempts to uncover these clues. To maintain segmentation performance, the perception network is integrated with the hiding network and optimized end-to-end. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCC framework effectively degrades the quality of the reconstructed images with minimal impact on segmentation performance, providing privacy protection for cooperating vehicles. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: 本文提出Diff-Aid，一种轻量级、即插即用的推理时方法，通过自适应调整文本token与图像特征在不同Transformer块和去噪时间步间的交互，提升文本到图像生成中对复杂提示的忠实度，并提供可解释的调制模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型难以准确遵循复杂文本描述，主因是文本与视觉特征间交互不足；已有方法在灵活性和动态建模跨模块、跨时间步交互方面存在局限。

Method: 提出Diff-Aid，一种在推理阶段动态调节每token文本与图像特征交互的轻量机制，覆盖不同Transformer块和去噪时间步，无需修改模型结构或训练。

Result: 在SD 3.5和FLUX等强基线上显著提升提示遵循度、图像质量及人类偏好；同时生成可解释的语义对齐调制模式，并支持风格LoRA、可控生成与零样本编辑等下游任务。

Conclusion: Diff-Aid是一种高效、灵活、即插即用的推理增强方法，兼顾性能提升与可解释性，为T2I模型的语义对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable advancement, yet faithfully following complex textual descriptions remains challenging due to insufficient interactions between textual and visual features. Prior approaches enhance such interactions via architectural design or handcrafted textual condition weighting, but lack flexibility and overlook the dynamic interactions across different blocks and denoising stages. To provide a more flexible and efficient solution to this problem, we propose Diff-Aid, a lightweight inference-time method that adaptively adjusts per-token text and image interactions across transformer blocks and denoising timesteps. Beyond improving generation quality, Diff-Aid yields interpretable modulation patterns that reveal how different blocks, timesteps, and textual tokens contribute to semantic alignment during denoising. As a plug-and-play module, Diff-Aid can be seamlessly integrated into downstream applications for further improvement, including style LoRAs, controllable generation, and zero-shot editing. Experiments on strong baselines (SD 3.5 and FLUX) demonstrate consistent improvements in prompt adherence, visual quality, and human preference across various metrics. Our code and models will be released.

Motivation: 受人类视觉系统中并行且交互的上下文与空间理解通路启发，解决现有场景解析与几何视觉任务各自为政、缺乏协同的问题，并降低对昂贵人工标注对应关系的依赖。

Method: 提出双交互流（TwInS）框架：1）场景解析流提取多级上下文特征并注入几何视觉流以指导其迭代优化；2）几何流解码特征反向投影至上下文空间，通过新型跨任务适配器实现选择性异构特征融合；3）设计定制化半监督训练策略，利用大规模多视角数据实现无真值对应关系下的自进化训练。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的大量实验验证了TwInS各核心组件的有效性，并在性能上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TwInS是一种通用、统一的生物启发式联合学习框架，通过双向跨任务特征交互与半监督机制，有效提升了场景解析与几何视觉任务的协同性能，具备良好的泛化性与实用性。

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system, which operates on two parallel yet interactive streams for contextual and spatial understanding, this article presents Two Interactive Streams (TwInS), a novel bio-inspired joint learning framework capable of simultaneously performing scene parsing and geometric vision tasks. TwInS adopts a unified, general-purpose architecture in which multi-level contextual features from the scene parsing stream are infused into the geometric vision stream to guide its iterative refinement. In the reverse direction, decoded geometric features are projected into the contextual feature space for selective heterogeneous feature fusion via a novel cross-task adapter, which leverages rich cross-view geometric cues to enhance scene parsing. To eliminate the dependence on costly human-annotated correspondence ground truth, TwInS is further equipped with a tailored semi-supervised training strategy, which unleashes the potential of large-scale multi-view data and enables continuous self-evolution without requiring ground-truth correspondences. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of TwInS's core components and demonstrate its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出AdaVBoost框架，通过引入视觉定位熵（VGE）动态评估每步生成中各token的幻觉风险，并据此自适应调整视觉注意力增强强度，从而在token级别实现精细化干预，显著提升大视觉语言模型抗幻觉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉注意力增强方法采用预设缩放因子，难以兼顾不同生成步骤对增强强度的差异化需求，易导致增强不足或过度，引发新幻觉。

Method: 提出AdaVBoost框架，核心是定义视觉定位熵（VGE）作为幻觉风险指标，并基于VGE在每个生成步对各token实施差异化注意力增强。

Result: AdaVBoost在多个LVLM和幻觉评测基准上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: token级自适应视觉注意力增强能更精准抑制幻觉，VGE作为辅助信号可有效弥补传统熵指标的不足。

Abstract: Visual attention boosting has emerged as a promising direction for mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where existing methods primarily focus on where to boost by applying a predefined scaling to the attention of method-specific visual tokens during autoregressive generation. In this paper, we identify a fundamental trade-off in these methods: a predefined scaling factor can be too weak at some generation steps, leaving hallucinations unresolved, yet too strong at others, leading to new hallucinations. Motivated by this finding, we propose AdaVBoost, a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively determines how much attention to boost at each generation step. Specifically, we introduce Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE) to estimate hallucination risk, which leverages visual grounding as a complementary signal to capture evidence mismatches beyond entropy. Guided by VGE, AdaVBoost applies stronger visual attention boosting to high-risk tokens and weaker boosting to low-risk tokens, enabling token-level adaptive intervention at each generation step. Extensive experiments show that AdaVBoost significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple LVLMs and hallucination benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答方法通常均匀采样帧，导致计算冗余和效率低下，亟需一种能自适应选择关键帧、动态维持状态并支持灵活模型集成的高效稀疏推理机制。

Method: 提出REVISE多轮代理框架：基于VLMs进行关键帧选择、摘要状态维护与早停策略；设计无标注奖励函数EAGER，包含置信增益、摘要充分性、正确且早停三项指标，用于强化微调。

Result: 在多个VQA基准上，REVISE在提升准确率的同时显著减少所用帧数、交互轮次和提示词数量，验证了其稀疏视频推理的有效性与实用性。

Conclusion: REVISE为视频问答提供了一种高效、通用且可微调的稀疏推理范式，兼顾性能与效率，适用于不同视觉语言模型，并为后续轻量级多模态推理研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present \revise (\underline{Re}asoning with \underline{Vi}deo \underline{S}parsity), a multi-round agent for video question answering (VQA). Instead of uniformly sampling frames, \revise selects a small set of informative frames, maintains a summary-as-state across rounds, and stops early when confident. It supports proprietary vision-language models (VLMs) in a ``plug-and-play'' setting and enables reinforcement fine-tuning for open-source models. For fine-tuning, we introduce EAGER (Evidence-Adjusted Gain for Efficient Reasoning), an annotation-free reward with three terms: (1) Confidence gain: after new frames are added, we reward the increase in the log-odds gap between the correct option and the strongest alternative; (2) Summary sufficiency: at answer time we re-ask using only the last committed summary and reward success; (3) Correct-and-early stop: answering correctly within a small turn budget is rewarded. Across multiple VQA benchmarks, \revise improves accuracy while reducing frames, rounds, and prompt tokens, demonstrating practical sparse video reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中视觉感知因外科医生和手术类型不同而差异显著，导致评估、培训及AI系统开发缺乏一致性；现有手术AI模型任务定义狭窄，难以跨手术类型或机构泛化。

Method: 提出ZEN模型，采用自监督多教师蒸馏框架，在涵盖21种以上手术、超400万帧的大规模多样化数据集上训练，并在统一基准下系统评估多种表征学习策略。

Result: ZEN在20个下游任务中，涵盖全微调、冻结骨干、少样本和零样本设置，均持续优于现有手术基础模型，并展现出强健的跨手术类型泛化能力。

Conclusion: ZEN代表了迈向统一手术场景理解表征的重要一步，有望推动术中辅助与手术培训评估等未来应用。

Abstract: In minimally invasive surgery, clinical decisions depend on real-time visual interpretation, yet intraoperative perception varies substantially across surgeons and procedures. This variability limits consistent assessment, training, and the development of reliable artificial intelligence systems, as most surgical AI models are designed for narrowly defined tasks and do not generalize across procedures or institutions. Here we introduce ZEN, a generalizable foundation model for intraoperative surgical video understanding trained on more than 4 million frames from over 21 procedures using a self-supervised multi-teacher distillation framework. We curated a large and diverse dataset and systematically evaluated multiple representation learning strategies within a unified benchmark. Across 20 downstream tasks and full fine-tuning, frozen-backbone, few-shot and zero-shot settings, ZEN consistently outperforms existing surgical foundation models and demonstrates robust cross-procedure generalization. These results suggest a step toward unified representations for surgical scene understanding and support future applications in intraoperative assistance and surgical training assessment.

Method: DCDM将视频一致性建模分解为三个专用模块：1）利用大语言模型解析提示并驱动扩散Transformer实现帧内世界知识一致性；2）在噪声空间中构建时序相机表征，并结合文生图初始化增强相机运动控制；3）采用窗口化交叉注意力与稀疏跨镜头自注意力实现跨镜头元素一致性。所有模块共享统一视频生成主干。

Result: 在AAAI'26 CVM竞赛测试集上验证表明，DCDM能有效提升视频生成在世界知识、相机运动和跨镜头元素三个维度的一致性。

Conclusion: DCDM通过系统性分解与协同建模，显著改善了视频生成中多尺度一致性问题，为可控、连贯的长视频生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent video generative models have demonstrated impressive visual fidelity, yet they often struggle with semantic, geometric, and identity consistency. In this paper, we propose a system-level framework, termed the Divide-and-Conquer Diffusion Model (DCDM), to address three key challenges: (1) intra-clip world knowledge consistency, (2) inter-clip camera consistency, and (3) inter-shot element consistency. DCDM decomposes video consistency modeling under these scenarios into three dedicated components while sharing a unified video generation backbone. For intra-clip consistency, DCDM leverages a large language model to parse input prompts into structured semantic representations, which are subsequently translated into coherent video content by a diffusion transformer. For inter-clip camera consistency, we propose a temporal camera representation in the noise space that enables precise and stable camera motion control, along with a text-to-image initialization mechanism to further enhance controllability. For inter-shot consistency, DCDM adopts a holistic scene generation paradigm with windowed cross-attention and sparse inter-shot self-attention, ensuring long-range narrative coherence while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our framework on the test set of the CVM Competition at AAAI'26, and the results demonstrate that the proposed strategies effectively address these challenges.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了KorMedMCQA-V，一个面向韩语医学执照考试的多模态多选题问答基准数据集，包含1534道题目和2043张医学图像，用于评估视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在韩语医学推理任务上的能力。研究对50多个VLM进行了零样本评测，发现专为推理优化的模型显著优于指令微调模型，而韩语或医学领域专用模型表现不一，尤其在多图问题上性能普遍下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有韩语医学问答基准缺乏多模态支持，难以全面评估VLM在真实临床图像理解与跨图像推理方面的能力；需构建具备代表性医学影像、覆盖多模态挑战（如多图整合）的韩语基准以推动本土化医疗AI发展。

Method: 构建KorMedMCQA-V数据集：从2012–2023年韩国医学执照考试真题中收集1534道多选题及2043张对应图像（含X光、CT、ECG等6类临床模态），其中约30%题目需整合多张图像证据；在统一零样本设定下，系统评测50+个涵盖通用、医学专用、韩语专用三类的VLM。

Result: Gemini-3.0-Pro（最优闭源模型）达96.9%准确率，Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking（最优开源模型）为83.7%，VARCO-VISION-2.0-14B（最优韩语专用模型）仅43.2%；推理导向变体提升最高达+20个百分点；所有模型在多图问题上性能下降；不同影像模态间表现差异显著。

Conclusion: KorMedMCQA-V填补了韩语医学多模态评测空白，揭示当前VLM在跨图像推理和韩语医学理解方面仍存在明显短板，强调推理能力比单纯领域/语言适配更关键；该基准与文本版KorMedMCQA共同构成韩语医疗AI统一评测体系。

Abstract: We introduce KorMedMCQA-V, a Korean medical licensing-exam-style multimodal multiple-choice question answering benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). The dataset consists of 1,534 questions with 2,043 associated images from Korean Medical Licensing Examinations (2012-2023), with about 30% containing multiple images requiring cross-image evidence integration. Images cover clinical modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT), electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound, endoscopy, and other medical visuals. We benchmark over 50 VLMs across proprietary and open-source categories-spanning general-purpose, medical-specialized, and Korean-specialized families-under a unified zero-shot evaluation protocol. The best proprietary model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) achieves 96.9% accuracy, the best open-source model (Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking) 83.7%, and the best Korean-specialized model (VARCO-VISION-2.0-14B) only 43.2%. We further find that reasoning-oriented model variants gain up to +20 percentage points over instruction-tuned counterparts, medical domain specialization yields inconsistent gains over strong general-purpose baselines, all models degrade on multi-image questions, and performance varies notably across imaging modalities. By complementing the text-only KorMedMCQA benchmark, KorMedMCQA-V forms a unified evaluation suite for Korean medical reasoning across text-only and multimodal conditions.

*Armin Saadat,Nima Hashemi,Bahar Khodabakhshian,Michael Y. Tsang,Christina Luong,Teresa S. M. Tsang,Purang Abolmaesumi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于强化学习的个性化数据采集策略，用于床旁超声心动图（POCUS）中高效评估心力衰竭：RL代理动态选择最需获取的心脏切面或终止采集，随后多视图Transformer联合预测主动脉瓣狭窄程度与左室射血分数，并输出不确定性以权衡诊断精度与采集成本；在测试集上以32%更少视频达到全视图性能，平均平衡准确率达77.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统POCUS需采集大量心脏切面，耗时且依赖操作者经验，难以满足床旁快速、低负担决策需求；亟需一种能根据患者个体情况动态优化采集过程、兼顾诊断准确性与效率的方法。

Method: 将POCUS建模为序列采集问题：强化学习（RL）代理在每步决定采集下一个视频切面或终止；终止后，共享多视图Transformer执行双任务推理——序数型主动脉狭窄（AS）分类与左室射血分数（LVEF）回归，并输出高斯预测分布以量化不确定性；该不确定性驱动奖励函数，在诊断收益与采集成本间进行权衡，生成患者特异性采集路径。

Result: 在含12,180例患者研究的数据集（训练/验证/测试=75/15/15）上，该方法在1,820例测试样本中，仅用68%的视频数量即达到与全视图采集相当的诊断性能，AS分类与LVEF估计的平均平衡准确率（bACC）达77.2%，展现出强鲁棒性与预算敏感性。

Conclusion: 该患者定制化、成本感知的采集框架可显著简化POCUS工作流而不损决策质量，生成可解释的扫描路径，适用于床旁场景；框架可拓展至其他心脏指标，具备临床转化潜力，需前瞻性研究进一步验证。

Abstract: Purpose: Echocardiography with point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) must support clinical decision-making under tight bedside time and operator-effort constraints. We introduce a personalized data acquisition strategy in which an RL agent, given a partially observed multi-view study, selects the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition to support heart-failure (HF) assessment. Upon termination, a diagnostic model jointly predicts aortic stenosis (AS) severity and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), two key HF biomarkers, and outputs uncertainty, enabling an explicit trade-off between diagnostic performance and acquisition cost. Methods: We model POCUS as a sequential acquisition problem: at each step, a video selector (RL agent) chooses the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition. Upon termination, a shared multi-view transformer performs multi-task inference with two heads, ordinal AS classification, and LVEF regression, and outputs Gaussian predictive distributions yielding ordinal probabilities over AS classes and EF thresholds. These probabilities drive a reward that balances expected diagnostic benefit against acquisition cost, producing patient-specific acquisition pathways. Results: The dataset comprises 12,180 patient-level studies, split into training/validation/test sets (75/15/15). On the 1,820 test studies, our method matches full-study performance while using 32% fewer videos, achieving 77.2% mean balanced accuracy (bACC) across AS severity classification and LVEF estimation, demonstrating robust multi-task performance under acquisition budgets. Conclusion: Patient-tailored, cost-aware acquisition can streamline POCUS workflows while preserving decision quality, producing interpretable scan pathways suited to bedside use. The framework is extensible to additional cardiac endpoints and merits prospective evaluation for clinical integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了LeafNet数据集和LeafBench基准，用于评估视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在植物病理学任务中的能力，揭示了当前VLMs在细粒度病原体识别等任务上的性能瓶颈，并验证了多模态架构相比纯视觉模型的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型和视觉-语言预训练模型在农业领域（如植物病理诊断）的应用受限于缺乏大规模、高质量的多模态图像-文本数据集与专用评测基准。

Method: 构建了包含18.6万张叶片图像、97类病害、13950个问答对的LeafNet数据集，并设计涵盖六类农业任务的LeafBench视觉问答基准；在12个SOTA VLM上进行系统评测，并对比纯视觉模型。

Result: 二分类（健康/患病）准确率超90%，但病原体与物种级细粒度识别低于65%；微调后的VLM显著优于纯视觉模型，证实语言表征对诊断精度提升关键。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在植物病理理解方面仍存在明显能力缺口，LeafBench为推动可靠AI辅助植物病害诊断提供了必要且严谨的评估框架。

Abstract: Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have significantly advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出EchoTorrent，一种面向实时多模态视频生成的新型架构，通过多教师训练、自适应CFG校准、混合长尾强制对齐和VAE解码器精炼四项技术，在保持高视觉质量的同时显著提升时序稳定性与唇音同步性，并支持少步自回归生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态视频生成模型存在推理延迟高、时序稳定性差的问题，流式推理下更会出现空间模糊、时序漂移和唇音不同步等多模态退化现象，导致效率与性能难以兼顾。

Method: 提出四部分方法：(1) 多教师训练，利用不同偏好领域的专家模型向学生模型渐进传递领域知识；(2) 自适应CFG校准（ACC-DMD），通过分阶段时空调度消除DMD中音频CFG增强误差，实现单步单次CFG计算；(3) 混合长尾强制对齐，在长周期自滚动训练中仅对尾帧施加对齐约束，采用因果-双向混合结构缓解流式下的时空退化；(4) VAE解码器精炼，通过像素域优化提升高频细节恢复能力，规避潜在空间歧义。

Result: 实验表明EchoTorrent在少步自回归生成下显著延长了时序一致性、身份保持能力和音频-唇部同步精度。

Conclusion: EchoTorrent有效解决了多模态视频生成中效率与性能之间的权衡难题，为实时流式跨模态视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal video generation models have achieved high visual quality, but their prohibitive latency and limited temporal stability hinder real-time deployment. Streaming inference exacerbates these issues, leading to pronounced multimodal degradation, such as spatial blurring, temporal drift, and lip desynchronization, which creates an unresolved efficiency-performance trade-off. To this end, we propose EchoTorrent, a novel schema with a fourfold design: (1) Multi-Teacher Training fine-tunes a pre-trained model on distinct preference domains to obtain specialized domain experts, which sequentially transfer domain-specific knowledge to a student model; (2) Adaptive CFG Calibration (ACC-DMD), which calibrates the audio CFG augmentation errors in DMD via a phased spatiotemporal schedule, eliminating redundant CFG computations and enabling single-pass inference per step; (3) Hybrid Long Tail Forcing, which enforces alignment exclusively on tail frames during long-horizon self-rollout training via a causal-bidirectional hybrid architecture, effectively mitigates spatiotemporal degradation in streaming mode while enhancing fidelity to reference frames; and (4) VAE Decoder Refiner through pixel-domain optimization of the VAE decoder to recover high-frequency details while circumventing latent-space ambiguities. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that EchoTorrent achieves few-pass autoregressive generation with substantially extended temporal consistency, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization.

Abstract: Environmental pollution is a critical global issue, with recycling emerging as one of the most viable solutions. This study focuses on waste segregation, a crucial step in recycling processes to obtain raw material. Recent advancements in computer vision have significantly contributed to waste classification and recognition. In waste segregation, segmentation masks are essential for robots to accurately localize and pick objects from conveyor belts. The complexity of real-world waste environments, characterized by deformed items without specific patterns and overlapping objects, further complicates waste segmentation tasks. This paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach to improve segmentation accuracy by combining high performing segmentation models, U-Net and FPN, using a weighted average method. U-Net excels in capturing fine details and boundaries in segmentation tasks, while FPN effectively handles scale variation and context in complex environments, and their combined masks result in more precise predictions. The dataset used closely mimics real-life waste scenarios, and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance feature learning for deep learning segmentation models. The ensemble model, referred to as EL-4, achieved an IoU value of 0.8306, an improvement over U-Net's 0.8065, and reduced Dice loss to 0.09019 from FPN's 0.1183. This study could contribute to the efficiency of waste sorting at Material Recovery Facility, facilitating better raw material acquisition for recycling with minimal human intervention and enhancing the overall throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型受限于标注数据稀缺及角膜神经形态的细粒度变异；通用生成式AI在医学图像合成中因缺乏领域特异性训练而难以保证解剖学保真度。

Method: 提出WDLoRA——一种参数高效微调（PEFT）机制，解耦权重更新的幅度与方向，分别建模神经拓扑结构（方向）与基质对比度（强度）；联合神经分割掩码与疾病特异性临床提示进行多模态条件生成。

Result: 合成图像FID=5.18、SSIM=0.630，显著优于GAN与标准扩散模型；保留金标准临床生物标志物，统计上等价于真实数据；用于训练下游模型时，诊断准确率提升2.1%，分割性能提升2.2%。

Conclusion: WDLoRA框架可有效缓解医学AI中的数据瓶颈，为CCM图像生成及DPN自动化诊断提供高保真、临床可信的合成数据解决方案。

Abstract: Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) is a sensitive tool for assessing small-fiber damage in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), yet the development of robust, automated deep learning-based diagnostic models is limited by scarce labelled data and fine-grained variability in corneal nerve morphology. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven foundation generative models excel at natural image synthesis, they often struggle in medical imaging due to limited domain-specific training, compromising the anatomical fidelity required for clinical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (WDLoRA)-based multimodal generative framework for clinically guided CCM image synthesis. WDLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanism that decouples magnitude and directional weight updates, enabling foundation generative models to independently learn the orientation (nerve topology) and intensity (stromal contrast) required for medical realism. By jointly conditioning on nerve segmentation masks and disease-specific clinical prompts, the model synthesises anatomically coherent images across the DPN spectrum (Control, T1NoDPN, T1DPN). A comprehensive three-pillar evaluation demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity (Fréchet Inception Distance (FID): 5.18) and structural integrity (Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM): 0.630), significantly outperforming GAN and standard diffusion baselines. Crucially, the synthetic images preserve gold-standard clinical biomarkers and are statistically equivalent to real patient data. When used to train automated diagnostic models, the synthetic dataset improves downstream diagnostic accuracy by 2.1% and segmentation performance by 2.2%, validating the framework's potential to alleviate data bottlenecks in medical AI.

Abstract: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections continuously affect a large proportion of the global population, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where access to specialized diagnostic expertise is limited. Although manual microscopic diagnosis of parasitic eggs remains the diagnostic gold standard, the approach can be labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This paper aims to utilize a vision language model (VLM) such as Microsoft Florence that was fine-tuned to localize all parasitic eggs within microscopic images. The preliminary results show that our localization VLM performs comparatively better than the other object detection methods, such as EfficientDet, with an mIOU of 0.94. This finding demonstrates the potential of the proposed VLM to serve as a core component of an automated framework, offering a scalable engineering solution for intelligent parasitological diagnosis.

Abstract: Robotic surgical systems rely heavily on high-quality visual feedback for precise teleoperation; yet, surgical smoke from energy-based devices significantly degrades endoscopic video feeds, compromising the human-robot interface and surgical outcomes. This paper presents RGA-Net (Reciprocal Gating and Attention-fusion Network), a novel deep learning framework specifically designed for smoke removal in robotic surgery workflows. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of surgical smoke-including dense, non-homogeneous distribution and complex light scattering-through a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture featuring two key innovations: (1) a Dual-Stream Hybrid Attention (DHA) module that combines shifted window attention with frequency-domain processing to capture both local surgical details and global illumination changes, and (2) an Axis-Decomposed Attention (ADA) module that efficiently processes multi-scale features through factorized attention mechanisms. These components are connected via reciprocal cross-gating blocks that enable bidirectional feature modulation between encoder and decoder pathways. Extensive experiments on the DesmokeData and LSD3K surgical datasets demonstrate that RGA-Net achieves superior performance in restoring visual clarity suitable for robotic surgery integration. Our method enhances the surgeon-robot interface by providing consistently clear visualization, laying a technical foundation for alleviating surgeons' cognitive burden, optimizing operation workflows, and reducing iatrogenic injury risks in minimally invasive procedures. These practical benefits could be further validated through future clinical trials involving surgeon usability assessments. The proposed framework represents a significant step toward more reliable and safer robotic surgical systems through computational vision enhancement.

TL;DR: 本文提出IGOFormer，一种新型基于查询的定向目标检测器，通过引入内在几何感知解码器和动量双匹配机制，显著提升了任意方向尤其是微小目标的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于查询的检测器在处理任意方向目标（特别是纹理信息有限的微小目标）时性能受限，主要由于像素级特征解码中未充分利用内在几何信息，以及阶段间双匹配导致的匹配不一致问题。

Method: 提出IGOFormer：1）设计内在几何感知解码器，将基于对象查询相关性外推的几何嵌入注入特征解码过程，以增强对目标几何布局与朝向的理解；2）构建基于动量的双匹配机制，通过带查询特异性平滑因子的指数滑动平均聚合历史匹配代价，缓解阶段间匹配不一致带来的监督冲突。

Result: 在DOTA-V1.0数据集单尺度设置下，采用Swin-T主干网络，IGOFormer达到78.00%的AP$_{50}$，显著优于现有方法；消融实验验证各模块有效性。

Conclusion: IGOFormer通过显式建模内在几何信息与稳定阶段间匹配，有效提升了航拍图像中任意方向目标（尤其是微小目标）的检测精度与鲁棒性，为定向目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent query-based detectors have achieved remarkable progress, yet their performance remains constrained when handling objects with arbitrary orientations, especially for tiny objects capturing limited texture information. This limitation primarily stems from the underutilization of intrinsic geometry during pixel-based feature decoding and the occurrence of inter-stage matching inconsistency caused by stage-wise bipartite matching. To tackle these challenges, we present IGOFormer, a novel query-based oriented object detector that explicitly integrates intrinsic geometry into feature decoding and enhances inter-stage matching stability. Specifically, we design an Intrinsic Geometry-aware Decoder, which enhances the object-related features conditioned on an object query by injecting complementary geometric embeddings extrapolated from their correlations to capture the geometric layout of the object, thereby offering a critical geometric insight into its orientation. Meanwhile, a Momentum-based Bipartite Matching scheme is developed to adaptively aggregate historical matching costs by formulating an exponential moving average with query-specific smoothing factors, effectively preventing conflicting supervisory signals arising from inter-stage matching inconsistency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our IGOFormer for aerial oriented object detection, achieving an AP$_{50}$ score of 78.00\% on DOTA-V1.0 using Swin-T backbone under the single-scale setting. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as powerful tools in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as segmentation, anomaly detection, and high-quality synthetic data generation. These models typically rely on learning meaningful latent representations, which are particularly valuable given the high-dimensional nature of 3D medical images like brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Despite their potential, latent representations remain underexplored in terms of their structure, information content, and applicability to downstream clinical tasks. Investigating these representations is crucial for advancing the use of generative models in neuroimaging research and clinical decision-making. In this work, we develop multiple variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode 3D brain MRI scans into compact latent space representations for generative and predictive applications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations through three key analyses: (i) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of MRI reconstruction quality, (ii) a visualisation of the latent space structure using Principal Component Analysis, and (iii) downstream classification tasks on a proprietary dataset of euploid and Down syndrome individuals brain MRI scans. Our results demonstrate that the VAE successfully captures essential brain features while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. The latent space exhibits clear clustering patterns, particularly in distinguishing individuals with Down syndrome from euploid controls.

Abstract: Most existing evaluations of text-to-motion generation focus on in-distribution textual inputs and a limited set of evaluation criteria, which restricts their ability to systematically assess model generalization and motion generation capabilities under complex out-of-distribution (OOD) textual conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a benchmark specifically designed for OOD text-to-motion evaluation, which includes a comprehensive analysis of 14 representative baseline models and the two datasets derived from evaluation results. Specifically, we construct an OOD prompt dataset consisting of 1,025 textual descriptions. Based on this prompt dataset, we introduce a unified evaluation framework that integrates LLM-based Evaluation, Multi-factor Motion evaluation, and Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation. Our experimental results reveal that while different baseline models demonstrate strengths in areas such as text-to-motion semantic alignment, motion generalizability, and physical quality, most models struggle to achieve strong performance with Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation. These findings highlight the limitations of existing methods in OOD scenarios and offer practical guidance for the design and evaluation of future production-level text-to-motion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多模态大语言模型在理解科学图像（如示意图、实验表征、分析图表）方面能力有限，主要受限于数据集领域覆盖窄、结构标注粗糙、语义基础薄弱。

Method: 构建包含150万张图-标题-上下文三元组、覆盖10余个主要学科的OmniScience高质量多模态数据集；设计动态模型路由重标注流程，融合视觉特征、原始图注与文中引用生成高密度、自包含描述，并通过严格质量过滤与专家判断对齐确保准确性与完整性。

Result: 图像-文本多模态相似度得分从0.769提升至0.956；基于OmniScience微调的Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型在MM-MT-Bench和MMMU基准上分别提升0.378和0.140。

Conclusion: OmniScience显著提升了多模态大语言模型对科学图像的理解能力，所提方法为科学图像理解提供了高质量数据基础与有效训练范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models demonstrate strong performance on natural image understanding, yet exhibit limited capability in interpreting scientific images, including but not limited to schematic diagrams, experimental characterizations, and analytical charts. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-source MLLMs. The gap largely stems from existing datasets with limited domain coverage, coarse structural annotations, and weak semantic grounding. We introduce OmniScience, a large-scale, high-fidelity multi-modal dataset comprising 1.5 million figure-caption-context triplets, spanning more than 10 major scientific disciplines. To obtain image caption data with higher information density and accuracy for multi-modal large-model training, we develop a dynamic model-routing re-captioning pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models to generate dense, self-contained descriptions by jointly synthesizing visual features, original figure captions, and corresponding in-text references authored by human scientists. The pipeline is further reinforced with rigorous quality filtering and alignment with human expert judgments, ensuring both factual accuracy and semantic completeness, and boosts the image-text multi-modal similarity score from 0.769 to 0.956. We further propose a caption QA protocol as a proxy task for evaluating visual understanding. Under this setting, Qwen2.5-VL-3B model finetuned on OmniScience show substantial gains over baselines, achieving a gain of 0.378 on MM-MT-Bench and a gain of 0.140 on MMMU.

Conclusion: SAM4Dcap成功桥接前沿计算机视觉与经典生物力学仿真，为非实验室环境下的运动分析提供了灵活、可及的基础工具。

Abstract: Quantitative biomechanical analysis is essential for clinical diagnosis and injury prevention but is often restricted to laboratories due to the high cost of optical motion capture systems. While multi-view video approaches have lowered barriers, they remain impractical for home-based scenarios requiring monocular capture. This paper presents SAM4Dcap, an open-source, end-to-end framework for estimating biomechanical metrics from monocular video without additional training. SAM4Dcap integrates the temporally consistent 4D human mesh recovery of SAM-Body4D with the OpenSim biomechanical solver. The pipeline converts reconstructed meshes into trajectory files compatible with diverse musculoskeletal models. We introduce automated prompting strategies and a Linux-native build for processing. Preliminary evaluations on walking and drop-jump tasks indicate that SAM4Dcap has the potential to achieve knee kinematic predictions comparable to multi-view systems, although some discrepancies in hip flexion and residual jitter remain. By bridging advanced computer vision with established biomechanical simulation, SAM4Dcap provides a flexible, accessible foundation for non-laboratory motion analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线3D MOT方法只是在线框架的直接迁移，未能充分利用离线场景下的资源无约束性和未来可观测性优势，且依赖固定上游模型和定制架构，适应性差。

Method: 提出Tracking-by-Tracking（TBT）标准化范式，构建Offline-Poly方法：包含预处理（去除ghost、重识别碎片）、分层匹配与融合（基于场景级相似度跨源关联）、轨迹细化（联合局部与全局运动模式）三个模块。

Result: 在nuScenes上AMOTA达77.6%，KITTI上HOTA达83.00%，均达SOTA；实验验证了其灵活性、泛化性与模块有效性。

Conclusion: Offline-Poly通过跟踪中心设计与TBT范式，首次系统性地挖掘离线3D MOT潜力，为4D自动标注提供更鲁棒、通用的轨迹后处理方案。

Abstract: Offline 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is a critical component of the 4D auto-labeling (4DAL) process. It enhances pseudo-labels generated by high-performance detectors through the incorporation of temporal context. However, existing offline 3D MOT approaches are direct extensions of online frameworks and fail to fully exploit the advantages of offline setting. Moreover, these methods often depend on fixed upstream and customized architectures, limiting their adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose Offline-Poly, a general offline 3D MOT method based on a tracking-centric design. We introduce a standardized paradigm termed Tracking-by-Tracking (TBT), which operates exclusively on arbitrary off-the-shelf tracking outputs and produces offline-refined tracklets. This formulation decouples offline tracker from specific upstream detectors or trackers. Under the TBT paradigm, Offline-Poly accepts one or multiple coarse tracking results and processes them through a structured pipeline comprising pre-processing, hierarchical matching and fusion, and tracklet refinement. Each module is designed to capitalize on the two fundamental properties of offline tracking: resource unconstrainedness, which permits global optimization beyond real-time limits, and future observability, which enables tracklet reasoning over the full temporal horizon. Offline-Poly first eliminates short-term ghost tracklets and re-identifies fragmented segments using global scene context. It then constructs scene-level similarity to associate tracklets across multiple input sources. Finally, Offline-Poly refines tracklets by jointly leveraging local and global motion patterns. On nuScenes, we achieve SOTA performance with 77.6% AMOTA. On KITTI, it achieves leading results with 83.00% HOTA. Comprehensive experiments further validate the flexibility, generalizability, and modular effectiveness of Offline-Poly.

Conclusion: 骨架到网格的物理一致性可通过可微物理奖励引导的强化学习微调有效提升，兼顾真实性与动态表现力。

Abstract: Despite advances in dance generation, most methods are trained in the skeletal domain and ignore mesh-level physical constraints. As a result, motions that look plausible as joint trajectories often exhibit body self-penetration and Foot-Ground Contact (FGC) anomalies when visualized with a human body mesh, reducing the aesthetic appeal of generated dances and limiting their real-world applications. We address this skeleton-to-mesh gap by deriving physics-based rewards from the body mesh and applying Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) to steer the diffusion model toward physically plausible motion synthesis under mesh visualization. Our reward design combines (i) an imitation reward that measures a motion's general plausibility by its imitability in a physical simulator (penalizing penetration and foot skating), and (ii) a Foot-Ground Deviation (FGD) reward with test-time FGD guidance to better capture the dynamic foot-ground interaction in dance. However, we find that the physics-based rewards tend to push the model to generate freezing motions for fewer physical anomalies and better imitability. To mitigate it, we propose an anti-freezing reward to preserve motion dynamics while maintaining physical plausibility. Experiments on multiple dance datasets consistently demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the physical plausibility of generated motions, yielding more realistic and aesthetically pleasing dances.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) change detection methods can extract critical information on surface dynamics and are an essential means for humans to understand changes in the earth's surface and environment. Among these methods, semantic change detection (SCD) can more effectively interpret the multi-class information contained in bi-temporal RS imagery, providing semantic-level predictions that support dynamic change monitoring. However, due to the limited semantic understanding capability of the model and the inherent complexity of the SCD tasks, existing SCD methods face significant challenges in both performance and paradigm complexity. In this paper, we propose PerASCD, a SCD method driven by RS foundation model PerA, designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic understanding and overall performance. We introduce a modular Cascaded Gated Decoder (CG-Decoder) that simplifies complex SCD decoding pipelines while promoting effective multi-level feature interaction and fusion. In addition, we propose a Soft Semantic Consistency Loss (SSCLoss) to mitigate the numerical instability commonly encountered during SCD training. We further explore the applicability of multiple existing RS foundation models on the SCD task when equipped with the proposed decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that our decoder not only effectively simplifies the paradigm of SCD, but also achieves seamless adaptation across various vision encoders. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/SathShen/PerASCD.git.

Conclusion: 多尺度建模与多模态先验协同可有效提升单目动态场景重建的物理合理性、鲁棒性与保真度。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic scenes from casual videos is critical for scalable robot learning, yet four-dimensional (4D) reconstruction under strictly monocular settings remains highly ill-posed. To address this challenge, our key insight is that real-world dynamics exhibits a multi-scale regularity from object to particle level. To this end, we design the multi-scale dynamics mechanism that factorizes complex motion fields. Within this formulation, we propose Gaussian sequences with multi-scale dynamics, a novel representation for dynamic 3D Gaussians derived through compositions of multi-level motion. This layered structure substantially alleviates ambiguity of reconstruction and promotes physically plausible dynamics. We further incorporate multi-modal priors from vision foundation models to establish complementary supervision, constraining the solution space and improving the reconstruction fidelity. Our approach enables accurate and globally consistent 4D reconstruction from monocular casual videos. Experiments of dynamic novel-view synthesis (NVS) on benchmark and real-world manipulation datasets demonstrate considerable improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: DiWR是一种鲁棒、端到端、无需预处理的点云表面重建方法，能有效应对非均匀采样、噪声和离群点挑战，显著提升重建质量与实用性。

Abstract: We propose Dirichlet Winding Reconstruction (DiWR), a robust method for reconstructing watertight surfaces from unoriented point clouds with non-uniform sampling, noise, and outliers. Our method uses the generalized winding number (GWN) field as the target implicit representation and jointly optimizes point orientations, per-point area weights, and confidence coefficients in a single pipeline. The optimization minimizes the Dirichlet energy of the induced winding field together with additional GWN-based constraints, allowing DiWR to compensate for non-uniform sampling, reduce the impact of noise, and downweight outliers during reconstruction, with no reliance on separate preprocessing. We evaluate DiWR on point clouds from 3D Gaussian Splatting, a computer-vision pipeline, and corrupted graphics benchmarks. Experiments show that DiWR produces plausible watertight surfaces on these challenging inputs and outperforms both traditional multi-stage pipelines and recent joint orientation-reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: RPGD是一种实用、全自动且鲁棒的外参标定方法，适用于大规模3D HPE数据采集的实际部署。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RPGD (RANSAC-P3P Gradient Descent), a human-pose-driven extrinsic calibration framework that robustly aligns MoCap-based 3D skeletal data with monocular or multi-view RGB cameras using only natural human motion. RPGD formulates extrinsic calibration as a coarse-to-fine problem tailored to human poses, combining the global robustness of RANSAC-P3P with Gradient-Descent-based refinement. We evaluate RPGD on three large-scale public 3D HPE datasets as well as on a self-collected in-the-wild dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that RPGD consistently recovers extrinsic parameters with accuracy comparable to the provided ground truth, achieving sub-pixel MPJPE reprojection error even in challenging, noisy settings. These results indicate that RPGD provides a practical and automatic solution for reliable extrinsic calibration of large-scale 3D HPE dataset collection.

Conclusion: VAR-3D有效缓解了离散3D表示学习中的信息损失与目标错配问题，提升了文本驱动3D生成的几何一致性与语义对齐能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in auto-regressive transformers have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. However, text-to-3D generation remains challenging, primarily due to bottlenecks in learning discrete 3D representations. Specifically, existing approaches often suffer from information loss during encoding, causing representational distortion before the quantization process. This effect is further amplified by vector quantization, ultimately degrading the geometric coherence of text-conditioned 3D shapes. Moreover, the conventional two-stage training paradigm induces an objective mismatch between reconstruction and text-conditioned auto-regressive generation. To address these issues, we propose View-aware Auto-Regressive 3D (VAR-3D), which intergrates a view-aware 3D Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to convert the complex geometric structure of 3D models into discrete tokens. Additionally, we introduce a rendering-supervised training strategy that couples discrete token prediction with visual reconstruction, encouraging the generative process to better preserve visual fidelity and structural consistency relative to the input text. Experiments demonstrate that VAR-3D significantly outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and text-3D alignment.

Conclusion: 定向推理优化能显著提升多模态嵌入质量，为推理驱动的UME发展提供了实用高效的新路径。

Abstract: Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has become pivotal for advancing Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME) in addressing diverse cross-modal tasks. Recent studies demonstrate that incorporating generative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can substantially enhance task-specific representations compared to discriminative methods. However, the generated reasoning CoTs of existing generative embedding methods are limited to the textual analysis of queries and are irrelevant to the retrieval of the targets. To address these limitations, we propose a reasoning-driven UME framework that integrates Embedder-Guided Reinforcement Learning (EG-RL) to optimize the Reasoner to produce evidential Traceability CoT (T-CoT). Our key contributions are threefold: (1) We design an EG-RL framework where the Embedder provides explicit supervision to the Reasoner, ensuring the generated CoT traces are aligned with embedding tasks. (2) We introduce T-CoT, which extracts critical multimodal cues to focus on retrieval-relevant elements and provides multimodal inputs for the Embedder. (3) With limited computational resources, our framework outperforms the pioneering embedding model on both MMEB-V2 and UVRB benchmarks. The integration of multimodal evidence in structured reasoning, paired with retrieval-oriented alignment, effectively strengthens cross-modal semantic consistency and boosts the fine-grained matching capability of the model as well as the generalization across complex scenarios. Our work demonstrates that targeted reasoning optimization can significantly improve multimodal embedding quality, providing a practical and efficient solution for reasoning-driven UME development.

Conclusion: 应更加重视惯性传感器的可靠性，在工业XR系统的评估与设计中优先保障惯性模态的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) systems deployed in industrial and operational settings rely on Visual--Inertial Odometry (VIO) for continuous six-degree-of-freedom pose tracking, yet these environments often involve sensing conditions that deviate from ideal assumptions. Despite this, most VIO evaluations emphasize nominal sensor behavior, leaving the effects of sustained sensor degradation under operational conditions insufficiently understood. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of VIO behavior under degraded sensing, examining faults affecting visual and inertial modalities across a range of operating regimes. Through systematic fault injection and quantitative evaluation, we observe a pronounced asymmetry in fault impact where degradations affecting visual sensing typically lead to bounded pose errors on the order of centimeters, whereas degradations affecting inertial sensing can induce substantially larger trajectory deviations, in some cases reaching hundreds to thousands of meters. These observations motivate greater emphasis on inertial reliability in the evaluation and design of XR systems for real-life industrial settings.

Abstract: Ultrasound denoising is essential for mitigating speckle-induced degradations, thereby enhancing image quality and improving diagnostic reliability. Nevertheless, because speckle patterns inherently encode both texture and fine anatomical details, effectively suppressing noise while preserving structural fidelity remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a prior-guided hierarchical instance-pixel contrastive learning model for ultrasound denoising, designed to promote noise-invariant and structure-aware feature representations by maximizing the separability between noisy and clean samples at both pixel and instance levels. Specifically, a statistics-guided pixel-level contrastive learning strategy is introduced to enhance distributional discrepancies between noisy and clean pixels, thereby improving local structural consistency. Concurrently, a memory bank is employed to facilitate instance-level contrastive learning in the feature space, encouraging representations that more faithfully approximate the underlying data distribution. Furthermore, a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture is adopted, coupling a Transformer-based encoder for global context modeling with a CNN-based decoder optimized for fine-grained anatomical structure restoration, thus enabling complementary exploitation of long-range dependencies and local texture details. Extensive evaluations on two publicly available ultrasound datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and superiority.

This survey presents the first systematic review of global solvers in geometric vision, unifying the field through a comprehensive taxonomy of three core paradigms: Branch-and-Bound (BnB), Convex Relaxation (CR), and Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). We present their theoretical foundations, algorithmic designs, and practical enhancements for robustness and scalability, examining how each addresses the fundamental nonconvexity of geometric estimation problems. Our analysis spans ten core vision tasks, from Wahba problem to bundle adjustment, revealing the optimality-robustness-scalability trade-offs that govern solver selection. We identify critical future directions: scaling algorithms while maintaining guarantees, integrating data-driven priors with certifiable optimization, establishing standardized benchmarks, and addressing societal implications for safety-critical deployment. By consolidating theoretical foundations, practical advances, and broader impacts, this survey provides a unified perspective and roadmap toward certifiable, trustworthy perception for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效平衡了通信效率与生成质量，为语义通信驱动的视频生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce a video diffusion model for high-fidelity, causal, and real-time video generation under ultra-low-bitrate semantic communication constraints. Our approach utilizes lossy semantic video coding to transmit the semantic scene structure, complemented by a stream of highly compressed, low-resolution frames that provide sufficient texture information to preserve fidelity. Building on these inputs, we introduce a modular video diffusion model that contains Semantic Control, Restoration Adapter, and Temporal Adapter. We further introduce an efficient temporal distillation procedure that enables extension to real-time and causal synthesis, reducing trainable parameters by 300x and training time by 2x, while adhering to communication constraints. Evaluated across diverse datasets, the framework achieves strong perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and temporal consistency at ultra-low bitrates (< 0.0003 bpp), outperforming classical, neural, and generative baselines in extensive quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管TAVI技术不断进步，但术后常见的瓣周主动脉反流（PVR）仍严重影响患者长期预后，亟需术前精准预测手段。

Method: 基于TAVI患者术前心脏CT数据集，采用各向同性三维CT体数据训练3D卷积神经网络进行PVR发生预测。

Result: 模型能从术前CT中捕获细微解剖特征，展现出预测PVR发生的潜力。

Conclusion: 体积深度学习有望成为TAVI术前个性化风险评估与手术方案优化的新工具。

Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis is a common and life-threatening condition in elderly patients, often treated with Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). Despite procedural advances, paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PVR) remains one of the most frequent post-TAVI complications, with a proven impact on long-term prognosis.
  In this work, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the occurrence of PVR from preoperative cardiac CT. To this end, a dataset of preoperative TAVI patients was collected, and 3D convolutional neural networks were trained on isotropic CT volumes. The results achieved suggest that volumetric deep learning can capture subtle anatomical features from pre-TAVI imaging, opening new perspectives for personalized risk assessment and procedural optimization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种以部件为中心的生成框架，用于从单张图像快速生成具有准确部件结构与合理运动学特性的可动3D资产，避免了传统优化方法的耗时问题，并在一致性、部件精度和运动合理性上优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以兼顾高保真度、可扩展性与效率：优化类方法准确但耗时（数十分钟至数小时），而推理时方法（如模板/部件检索）虽快却常无法匹配输入的具体结构与外观。

Method: 提出一种部件中心的生成框架，将物体建模为一组可移动部件，每个部件由带部件身份与运动线索的潜在token编码；以单张图像为条件，端到端生成具备实例级对应、有效部件结构与运动学合理性的3D资产。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高质量、高效率、可控的可动物体生成，适用于具身AI、机器人及VR/AR等需要实时交互的场景。

Abstract: Articulated objects are central to interactive 3D applications, including embodied AI, robotics, and VR/AR, where functional part decomposition and kinematic motion are essential. Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive workflow for generating and validating a synthetic dataset designed for robotic surgery instrument segmentation. A 3D reconstruction of the Da Vinci robotic arms was refined and animated in Autodesk Maya through a fully automated Python-based pipeline capable of producing photorealistic, labeled video sequences. Each scene integrates randomized motion patterns, lighting variations, and synthetic blood textures to mimic intraoperative variability while preserving pixel-accurate ground truth masks. To validate the realism and effectiveness of the generated data, several segmentation models were trained under controlled ratios of real and synthetic data. Results demonstrate that a balanced composition of real and synthetic samples significantly improves model generalization compared to training on real data only, while excessive reliance on synthetic data introduces a measurable domain shift. The proposed framework provides a reproducible and scalable tool for surgical computer vision, supporting future research in data augmentation, domain adaptation, and simulation-based pretraining for robotic-assisted surgery.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SimCLR的自监督学习预训练策略，用于从心尖四腔心超声视频中更准确地预测心输出量（CO），在数据有限的情况下仍表现出色，且性能优于使用百万级数据训练的PanEcho模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心输出量（CO）是心血管疾病诊断和管理的关键参数，但其准确测量依赖侵入性且耗时的右心导管术，因此亟需可靠的非侵入式替代方法，如超声心动图。

Method: 采用基于SimCLR的自监督学习（SSL）预训练策略，直接在下游任务可用的有限数据集上进行预训练，以提升CO预测性能。

Result: SSL有效缓解了过拟合问题并增强了表征学习能力，在测试集上达到平均Pearson相关系数0.41，性能超越在超百万例超声检查数据上训练的PanEcho模型。

Conclusion: 即使在数据稀缺条件下，自监督学习也能显著提升超声视频中CO预测的准确性与鲁棒性，为临床提供更具可行性的非侵入式评估工具。

Abstract: Cardiac Output (CO) is a key parameter in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. However, its accurate measurement requires right-heart catheterization, an invasive and time-consuming procedure, motivating the development of reliable non-invasive alternatives using echocardiography. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) pretraining strategy based on SimCLR to improve CO prediction from apical four-chamber echocardiographic videos. The pretraining is performed using the same limited dataset available for the downstream task, demonstrating the potential of SSL even under data scarcity. Our results show that SSL mitigates overfitting and improves representation learning, achieving an average Pearson correlation of 0.41 on the test set and outperforming PanEcho, a model trained on over one million echocardiographic exams.

### [82] [Low-Pass Filtering Improves Behavioral Alignment of Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13859)
*Max Wolff,Thomas Klein,Evgenia Rusak,Felix Wichmann,Wieland Brendel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现生成式模型在人类视觉行为对齐上的优势主要源于其内置的低通滤波效应（如图像缩放），而非模型架构本身；通过在测试时对判别式模型（如CLIP）输入图像施加简单模糊（低通滤波），即可显著提升其与人类错误一致性和形状偏好等行为指标的对齐度，甚至达到新SOTA；进一步证明该滤波特性与人类对比敏感度函数高度匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络虽在视觉基准上表现优异，但在模拟人类视觉行为（如错误一致性、形状偏差）方面仍不足；近期研究认为生成式分类器比判别式更具行为对齐潜力，本文旨在检验该假设是否真正源于生成式建模，还是其他隐含因素。

Method: 通过控制实验分离生成式模型中图像缩放操作的影响；在判别式模型（如CLIP）测试阶段直接对输入图像施加高斯模糊（低通滤波）；优化滤波器参数以最大化行为对齐；构建模型-人类基准的Pareto最优前沿；将最优滤波器频谱与人类对比敏感度函数进行对比分析。

Result: 测试时图像模糊可使CLIP等判别式模型的行为对齐度大幅提升，误差一致性指标达到新SOTA，对齐差距减半；最优低通滤波器（高斯核）的频谱特性与人类视觉系统的对比敏感度函数高度一致；直接优化滤波器可逼近Pareto最优前沿。

Conclusion: 生成式模型的行为优势并非源于其生成式本质，而是其预处理中的低通滤波效应；提升DNN与人类视觉对齐的关键在于引入符合人类感知特性的频域约束（如高斯低通滤波），为构建更符合认知机理的视觉模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on computer vision benchmarks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still fall short of adequately modeling human visual behavior, as measured by error consistency and shape bias. Recent work hypothesized that behavioral alignment can be drastically improved through \emph{generative} -- rather than \emph{discriminative} -- classifiers, with far-reaching implications for models of human vision.
  Here, we instead show that the increased alignment of generative models can be largely explained by a seemingly innocuous resizing operation in the generative model which effectively acts as a low-pass filter. In a series of controlled experiments, we show that removing high-frequency spatial information from discriminative models like CLIP drastically increases their behavioral alignment. Simply blurring images at test-time -- rather than training on blurred images -- achieves a new state-of-the-art score on the model-vs-human benchmark, halving the current alignment gap between DNNs and human observers. Furthermore, low-pass filters are likely optimal, which we demonstrate by directly optimizing filters for alignment. To contextualize the performance of optimal filters, we compute the frontier of all possible pareto-optimal solutions to the benchmark, which was formerly unknown.
  We explain our findings by observing that the frequency spectrum of optimal Gaussian filters roughly matches the spectrum of band-pass filters implemented by the human visual system. We show that the contrast sensitivity function, describing the inverse of the contrast threshold required for humans to detect a sinusoidal grating as a function of spatiotemporal frequency, is approximated well by Gaussian filters of the specific width that also maximizes error consistency.

Motivation: 探究深度神经网络模型是否能模拟人类的颜色恒常性机制，并与已知的局部环绕、最大通量和空间均值等经典机制进行比较。

Method: 采用预训练的ResNet-U-Net模型，通过迁移学习仅微调解码器部分，使其适应VR实验图像；模型输出用于执行与人类实验一致的无色物体选择任务。

Result: 模型与人类在基线条件下均表现出高颜色恒常性，且在移除局部环绕或空间均值线索时，二者性能下降模式高度相似。

Conclusion: 该DNN模型能有效模拟人类颜色恒常性行为，支持其内在机制与经典线索（如局部环绕、空间均值）密切相关。

Abstract: We previously investigated color constancy in photorealistic virtual reality (VR) and developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that predicts reflectance from rendered images. Here, we combine both approaches to compare and study a model and human performance with respect to established color constancy mechanisms: local surround, maximum flux and spatial mean. Rather than evaluating the model against physical ground truth, model performance was assessed using the same achromatic object selection task employed in the human experiments. The model, a ResNet based U-Net from our previous work, was pre-trained on rendered images to predict surface reflectance. We then applied transfer learning, fine-tuning only the network's decoder on images from the baseline VR condition. To parallel the human experiment, the model's output was used to perform the same achromatic object selection task across all conditions. Results show a strong correspondence between the model and human behavior. Both achieved high constancy under baseline conditions and showed similar, condition-dependent performance declines when the local surround or spatial mean color cues were removed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习风险预测模型（如Mirai）依赖高分辨率图像和简单多视图融合，缺乏对双侧乳腺不对称性的显式建模；本文旨在探索如何通过结构化建模低分辨率图像来保持高性能。

Method: 提出MamaDino：融合冻结的DINOv3 ViT-S特征与可训练CNN编码器（输入512×512），并引入BilateralMixer模块显式聚合双侧乳腺信息；在OPTIMAM数据集（53,883名女性）上训练，在内部及外部测试集上评估。

Result: MamaDino在乳腺级3年风险预测中，AUC达0.736（内部）和0.677（外部），与Mirai持平，但仅使用约1/13像素；BilateralMixer提升性能且泛化性强，跨年龄、种族、设备、肿瘤类型与分级稳定。

Conclusion: 显式建模双侧不对称性与融合互补归纳偏置，可在显著降低图像分辨率前提下实现最先进预测性能，为资源受限场景下的个性化筛查提供新路径。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening programmes increasingly seek to move from one-size-fits-all interval to risk-adapted and personalized strategies. Deep learning (DL) has enabled image-based risk models with stronger 1- to 5-year prediction than traditional clinical models, but leading systems (e.g., Mirai) typically use convolutional backbones, very high-resolution inputs (>1M pixels) and simple multi-view fusion, with limited explicit modelling of contralateral asymmetry.
  We hypothesised that combining complementary inductive biases (convolutional and transformer-based) with explicit contralateral asymmetry modelling would allow us to match state-of-the-art 3-year risk prediction performance even when operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms, indicating that using less detailed images in a more structured way can recover state-of-the-art accuracy.
  We present MamaDino, a mammography-aware multi-view attentional DINO model. MamaDino fuses frozen self-supervised DINOv3 ViT-S features with a trainable CNN encoder at 512x512 resolution, and aggregates bilateral breast information via a BilateralMixer to output a 3-year breast cancer risk score. We train on 53,883 women from OPTIMAM (UK) and evaluate on matched 3-year case-control cohorts: an in-distribution test set from four screening sites and an external out-of-distribution cohort from an unseen site.
  At breast-level, MamaDino matches Mirai on both internal and external tests while using ~13x fewer input pixels. Adding the BilateralMixer improves discrimination to AUC 0.736 (vs 0.713) in-distribution and 0.677 (vs 0.666) out-of-distribution, with consistent performance across age, ethnicity, scanner, tumour type and grade. These findings demonstrate that explicit contralateral modelling and complementary inductive biases enable predictions that match Mirai, despite operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in multimodal learning within computational pathology. Existing models primarily rely on vision and language modalities; however, language alone lacks molecular specificity and offers limited pathological supervision, leading to representational bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose STAMP, a Spatial Transcriptomics-Augmented Multimodal Pathology representation learning framework that integrates spatially-resolved gene expression profiles to enable molecule-guided joint embedding of pathology images and transcriptomic data. Our study shows that self-supervised, gene-guided training provides a robust and task-agnostic signal for learning pathology image representations. Incorporating spatial context and multi-scale information further enhances model performance and generalizability. To support this, we constructed SpaVis-6M, the largest Visium-based spatial transcriptomics dataset to date, and trained a spatially-aware gene encoder on this resource. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale contrastive alignment and cross-scale patch localization mechanisms, STAMP effectively aligns spatial transcriptomics with pathology images, capturing spatial structure and molecular variation. We validate STAMP across six datasets and four downstream tasks, where it consistently achieves strong performance. These results highlight the value and necessity of integrating spatially resolved molecular supervision for advancing multimodal learning in computational pathology. The code is included in the supplementary materials. The pretrained weights and SpaVis-6M are available at: https://github.com/Hanminghao/STAMP.

Abstract: Data-driven approaches like deep learning are rapidly advancing planetary science, particularly in Mars exploration. Despite recent progress, most existing benchmarks remain confined to closed-set supervised visual tasks and do not support text-guided retrieval for geospatial discovery. We introduce MarsRetrieval, a retrieval benchmark for evaluating vision-language models for Martian geospatial discovery. MarsRetrieval includes three tasks: (1) paired image-text retrieval, (2) landform retrieval, and (3) global geo-localization, covering multiple spatial scales and diverse geomorphic origins. We propose a unified retrieval-centric protocol to benchmark multimodal embedding architectures, including contrastive dual-tower encoders and generative vision-language models. Our evaluation shows MarsRetrieval is challenging: even strong foundation models often fail to capture domain-specific geomorphic distinctions. We further show that domain-specific fine-tuning is critical for generalizable geospatial discovery in planetary settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/ml-stat-Sustech/MarsRetrieval

TL;DR: 本文提出Elastic Diffusion Transformer (E-DiT)，一种针对Diffusion Transformer的自适应加速框架，通过轻量级路由器动态识别样本依赖的计算稀疏性，并结合块级特征缓存机制，在保持生成质量的同时实现最高约2倍的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiT加速方法（如剪枝、蒸馏）依赖固定计算容量，导致加速不足且生成质量下降；而作者观察到DiT生成过程存在显著且样本依赖的计算稀疏性，可据此设计更灵活高效的加速策略。

Method: E-DiT为每个DiT块配备轻量级路由器，动态判断该块是否可跳过，并在不跳过时预测最优MLP宽度缩减比；同时引入训练无关的块级特征缓存机制，依据路由器预测消除冗余计算。

Result: 在2D图像（Qwen-Image、FLUX）和3D资产（Hunyuan3D-3.0）上实验表明，E-DiT实现最高约2倍加速，生成质量损失可忽略。

Conclusion: E-DiT通过样本自适应稀疏性建模与无训练缓存机制，有效平衡了DiT的效率与生成质量，为大模型高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain highly computationally expensive. Previous acceleration methods, such as pruning and distillation, typically rely on a fixed computational capacity, leading to insufficient acceleration and degraded generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{Elastic Diffusion Transformer (E-DiT)}, an adaptive acceleration framework for DiT that effectively improves efficiency while maintaining generation quality. Specifically, we observe that the generative process of DiT exhibits substantial sparsity (i.e., some computations can be skipped with minimal impact on quality), and this sparsity varies significantly across samples. Motivated by this observation, E-DiT equips each DiT block with a lightweight router that dynamically identifies sample-dependent sparsity from the input latent. Each router adaptively determines whether the corresponding block can be skipped. If the block is not skipped, the router then predicts the optimal MLP width reduction ratio within the block. During inference, we further introduce a block-level feature caching mechanism that leverages router predictions to eliminate redundant computations in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments across 2D image (Qwen-Image and FLUX) and 3D asset (Hunyuan3D-3.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of E-DiT, achieving up to $\sim$2$\times$ speedup with negligible loss in generation quality. Code will be available at https://github.com/wangjiangshan0725/Elastic-DiT.

Result: 在IBench上实现SOTA性能：文本遵循性（CLIP-T: 0.281）、视觉一致性（CLIP-I: 0.827）、图像质量（IQ: 0.523），显著消除背景污染并保持身份一致性。

Conclusion: SpatialID是一种高效、无需训练的解决方案，在保持身份一致性的同时大幅提升文本遵循性和图像质量。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to integrate specific identities into arbitrary contexts. However, existing tuning-free methods typically employ Spatially Uniform Visual Injection, causing identity features to contaminate non-facial regions (e.g., backgrounds and lighting) and degrading text adherence. To address this without expensive fine-tuning, we propose SpatialID, a training-free spatially-adaptive identity modulation framework. SpatialID fundamentally decouples identity injection into face-relevant and context-free regions using a Spatial Mask Extractor derived from cross-attention responses. Furthermore, we introduce a Temporal-Spatial Scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts spatial constraints - transitioning from Gaussian priors to attention-based masks and adaptive relaxation - to align with the diffusion generation dynamics. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that SpatialID achieves state-of-the-art performance in text adherence (CLIP-T: 0.281), visual consistency (CLIP-I: 0.827), and image quality (IQ: 0.523), significantly eliminating background contamination while maintaining robust identity preservation.

TL;DR: LitePath是一种轻量级病理基础模型框架，通过模型蒸馏和自适应补丁选择，在大幅降低计算成本和能耗的同时，保持接近最先进模型的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理基础模型（PFMs）虽性能强，但计算开销大，难以在临床边缘设备上部署，限制了其可及性与规模化应用。

Method: 提出LitePath框架，包含两部分：1）LiteFM，基于1.9亿病理图像块，从Virchow2、H-Optimus-1和UNI2三大PFM蒸馏得到的紧凑模型；2）自适应补丁选择器（APS），用于任务导向的高效补丁筛选。同时提出Deployability Score（D-Score）综合评估精度与效率。

Result: 相比Virchow2，参数减少28倍、FLOPs降低403.5倍；在NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super上处理速度提升104.5倍，能耗降低171倍；在37个队列、26项任务中表现优异，AUC达Virchow2的99.71%，D-Score最高，超越Virchow2 10.64%。

Conclusion: LitePath实现了精度、速度、能效与部署可行性的良好平衡，为低功耗边缘设备上的临床级病理AI分析提供了实用化解决方案，并显著降低碳足迹。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have enabled robust generalization in computational pathology through large-scale datasets and expansive architectures, but their substantial computational cost, particularly for gigapixel whole slide images, limits clinical accessibility and scalability. Here, we present LitePath, a deployment-friendly foundational framework designed to mitigate model over-parameterization and patch level redundancy. LitePath integrates LiteFM, a compact model distilled from three large PFMs (Virchow2, H-Optimus-1 and UNI2) using 190 million patches, and the Adaptive Patch Selector (APS), a lightweight component for task-specific patch selection. The framework reduces model parameters by 28x and lowers FLOPs by 403.5x relative to Virchow2, enabling deployment on low-power edge hardware such as the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super. On this device, LitePath processes 208 slides per hour, 104.5x faster than Virchow2, and consumes 0.36 kWh per 3,000 slides, 171x lower than Virchow2 on an RTX3090 GPU. We validated accuracy using 37 cohorts across four organs and 26 tasks (26 internal, 9 external, and 2 prospective), comprising 15,672 slides from 9,808 patients disjoint from the pretraining data. LitePath ranks second among 19 evaluated models and outperforms larger models including H-Optimus-1, mSTAR, UNI2 and GPFM, while retaining 99.71% of the AUC of Virchow2 on average. To quantify the balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Deployability Score (D-Score), defined as the weighted geometric mean of normalized AUC and normalized FLOP, where LitePath achieves the highest value, surpassing Virchow2 by 10.64%. These results demonstrate that LitePath enables rapid, cost-effective and energy-efficient pathology image analysis on accessible hardware while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art PFMs and reducing the carbon footprint of AI deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出Flow4R框架，以相机空间场景流为核心表示，统一建模3D结构、物体运动与相机运动，通过ViT从双视角输入直接预测点位置、场景流、姿态权重和置信度，无需显式位姿回归或BA，在4D重建与跟踪任务中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常将几何与运动解耦：多视图重建假设场景静态，动态跟踪依赖显式相机位姿估计或独立运动模型，缺乏统一表征。

Method: 提出Flow4R，以相机空间场景流为统一表示；使用Vision Transformer从双视角输入端到端预测每像素的3D点位置、场景流、姿态权重和置信度；采用共享解码器对称推断局部几何与双向运动，不依赖显式位姿回归或bundle adjustment。

Result: 在4D重建与动态跟踪任务上达到SOTA性能，验证了流中心表征在时空场景理解中的有效性。

Conclusion: 以场景流为核心的统一表征可有效联合建模几何与运动，避免传统解耦方法的局限性，提升动态3D场景重建与跟踪的一致性与精度。

Abstract: Reconstructing and tracking dynamic 3D scenes remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing approaches often decouple geometry from motion: multi-view reconstruction methods assume static scenes, while dynamic tracking frameworks rely on explicit camera pose estimation or separate motion models. We propose Flow4R, a unified framework that treats camera-space scene flow as the central representation linking 3D structure, object motion, and camera motion. Flow4R predicts a minimal per-pixel property set-3D point position, scene flow, pose weight, and confidence-from two-view inputs using a Vision Transformer. This flow-centric formulation allows local geometry and bidirectional motion to be inferred symmetrically with a shared decoder in a single forward pass, without requiring explicit pose regressors or bundle adjustment. Trained jointly on static and dynamic datasets, Flow4R achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4D reconstruction and tracking tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the flow-central representation for spatiotemporal scene understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出FLEX框架，通过频率感知的RoPE调制、反相噪声采样和推理专用注意力锚点，在不重新训练的前提下显著提升自回归视频扩散模型的长时序外推能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视频扩散模型在超出训练时长进行外推时，因3D位置编码的频谱偏差和噪声采样缺乏动态先验，导致严重的时间退化。

Method: 提出FLEX：1）频率感知RoPE调制，自适应插值低频分量、外推高频分量；2）反相噪声采样（ANS），注入高频动态先验；3）推理专用注意力锚点（Inference-only Attention Sink），稳定全局结构。

Conclusion: FLEX是一种无需训练、即插即用的推理时框架，有效缓解频谱偏差与动态先验缺失问题，大幅提升视频生成时长上限与时间一致性。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have emerged as a scalable paradigm for long video generation. However, they often suffer from severe extrapolation failure, where rapid error accumulation leads to significant temporal degradation when extending beyond training horizons. We identify that this failure primarily stems from the \textit{spectral bias} of 3D positional embeddings and the lack of \textit{dynamic priors} in noise sampling. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{FLEX} (\textbf{F}requency-aware \textbf{L}ength \textbf{EX}tension), a training-free inference-time framework that bridges the gap between short-term training and long-term inference. FLEX introduces Frequency-aware RoPE Modulation to adaptively interpolate under-trained low-frequency components while extrapolating high-frequency ones to preserve multi-scale temporal discriminability. This is integrated with Antiphase Noise Sampling (ANS) to inject high-frequency dynamic priors and Inference-only Attention Sink to anchor global structure. Extensive evaluations on VBench demonstrate that FLEX significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models at $6\times$ extrapolation (30s duration) and matches the performance of long-video fine-tuned baselines at $12\times$ scale (60s duration). As a plug-and-play augmentation, FLEX seamlessly integrates into existing inference pipelines for horizon extension. It effectively pushes the generation limits of models such as LongLive, supporting consistent and dynamic video synthesis at a 4-minute scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SHAP启发的梯度-激活归因的层间剪枝框架，用于高效目标检测，相比传统L1范数剪枝，在多个模型上实现了更优的精度-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于权重幅值的剪枝方法不能准确反映网络组件对任务性能的真实功能贡献，难以在资源受限平台上实现高效部署。

Method: 提出一种可解释性驱动的层间剪枝框架，利用SHAP启发的梯度-激活归因来评估各层重要性，替代静态权重幅值作为剪枝依据。

Result: 在ResNet-50、MobileNetV2、ShuffleNetV2、Faster R-CNN、RetinaNet和YOLOv8等多个模型上验证，该方法在COCO 2017数据集上显著优于L1剪枝：如ShuffleNetV2提速10%，而L1剪枝导致性能下降13.7%；RetinaNet保持mAP不变且推理速度几乎无损，而L1剪枝造成1.3% mAP下降。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的层重要性评估更合理，可解释性驱动的压缩为边缘设备上的DNN部署提供了兼顾性能与可解释性的新路径。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in object detection tasks, but their increasing complexity poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. While model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as essential tools, traditional magnitude-based pruning methods do not necessarily align with the true functional contribution of network components to task-specific performance. In this work, we present an explainability-inspired, layer-wise pruning framework tailored for efficient object detection. Our approach leverages a SHAP-inspired gradient--activation attribution to estimate layer importance, providing a data-driven proxy for functional contribution rather than relying solely on static weight magnitudes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse object detection architectures, including ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOv8, evaluating performance on the Microsoft COCO 2017 validation set. The results show that the proposed attribution-inspired pruning consistently identifies different layers as least important compared to L1-norm-based methods, leading to improved accuracy--efficiency trade-offs. Notably, for ShuffleNetV2, our method yields a 10\% empirical increase in inference speed, whereas L1-pruning degrades performance by 13.7\%. For RetinaNet, the proposed approach preserves the baseline mAP (0.151) with negligible impact on inference speed, while L1-pruning incurs a 1.3\% mAP drop for a 6.2\% speed increase. These findings highlight the importance of data-driven layer importance assessment and demonstrate that explainability-inspired compression offers a principled direction for deploying deep neural networks on edge and resource-constrained platforms while preserving both performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: BitDance是一种新型自回归图像生成模型，通过预测二进制视觉token而非码本索引，结合二值扩散头与下一邻块扩散解码策略，在保持高性能的同时显著提升生成速度与参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成模型受限于离散码本大小和采样效率，难以兼顾表达力与推理速度；本文旨在设计一种更紧凑、高熵、可高效采样的离散表示及对应生成机制。

Method: 提出BitDance模型：1）使用高熵二进制视觉token（每个token最多2^256种状态）替代传统码本索引；2）采用二值扩散头（binary diffusion head）在连续空间中生成二进制token，避免softmax分类瓶颈；3）引入下一邻块扩散（next-patch diffusion）实现多token并行精准预测，加速推理。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上FID达1.24（AR模型最优）；以260M参数量超越1.4B参数的SOTA并行AR模型，参数减少5.4倍、推理加速8.7倍；生成1024×1024图像时比先前AR模型快30倍以上；在文本到图像任务中生成高分辨率、逼真图像，展现优异扩展性。

Conclusion: BitDance证明了基于二进制token与扩散式解码的AR范式在图像生成中兼具强表达力、高效率与良好扩展性，为AR基础模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: We present BitDance, a scalable autoregressive (AR) image generator that predicts binary visual tokens instead of codebook indices. With high-entropy binary latents, BitDance lets each token represent up to $2^{256}$ states, yielding a compact yet highly expressive discrete representation. Sampling from such a huge token space is difficult with standard classification. To resolve this, BitDance uses a binary diffusion head: instead of predicting an index with softmax, it employs continuous-space diffusion to generate the binary tokens. Furthermore, we propose next-patch diffusion, a new decoding method that predicts multiple tokens in parallel with high accuracy, greatly speeding up inference. On ImageNet 256x256, BitDance achieves an FID of 1.24, the best among AR models. With next-patch diffusion, BitDance beats state-of-the-art parallel AR models that use 1.4B parameters, while using 5.4x fewer parameters (260M) and achieving 8.7x speedup. For text-to-image generation, BitDance trains on large-scale multimodal tokens and generates high-resolution, photorealistic images efficiently, showing strong performance and favorable scaling. When generating 1024x1024 images, BitDance achieves a speedup of over 30x compared to prior AR models. We release code and models to facilitate further research on AR foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实世界图像恢复模型注重像素保真度，忽略任务相关语义；而标准分割模型在低质量图像上鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出语义约束恢复（SCR）模型，利用分割掩码对齐跨注意力图；再通过LoRA模块融合与任务微调，将恢复知识迁移到分割中。

Result: 在自建真实低质图像分割数据集及多个合成/真实基准上，SCR与RASS均显著优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 语义引导的图像恢复与分割联合优化是提升低质量图像分割性能的有效范式。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, the performance of semantic segmentation often deteriorates when processing low-quality (LQ) images, which may lack clear semantic structures and high-frequency details. Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks.

Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型主要关注目标对象和区域的编辑效果，常导致非目标区域出现意外变化，缺乏对内容一致性的保障。

Method: 构建了40K高质量编辑数据集；引入像素级相似性奖励与MLLM奖励结合；设计区域正则化机制，对高奖励样本保护非编辑区域，对低奖励样本增强编辑效果。

Result: 在GEdit-Bench和ImgEdit-Bench上验证，CoCoEdit在PSNR/SSIM指标和人工主观评分上显著提升内容一致性，同时保持SOTA级别的编辑质量。

Conclusion: 区域正则化强化学习可有效解耦编辑质量与内容一致性优化，为可控、可信图像编辑提供了新范式。

Abstract: Image editing has achieved impressive results with the development of large-scale generative models. However, existing models mainly focus on the editing effects of intended objects and regions, often leading to unwanted changes in unintended regions. We present a post-training framework for Content-Consistent Editing (CoCoEdit) via region regularized reinforcement learning. We first augment existing editing datasets with refined instructions and masks, from which 40K diverse and high quality samples are curated as training set. We then introduce a pixel-level similarity reward to complement MLLM-based rewards, enabling models to ensure both editing quality and content consistency during the editing process. To overcome the spatial-agnostic nature of the rewards, we propose a region-based regularizer, aiming to preserve non-edited regions for high-reward samples while encouraging editing effects for low-reward samples. For evaluation, we annotate editing masks for GEdit-Bench and ImgEdit-Bench, introducing pixel-level similarity metrics to measure content consistency and editing quality. Applying CoCoEdit to Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, we achieve not only competitive editing scores with state-of-the-art models, but also significantly better content consistency, measured by PSNR/SSIM metrics and human subjective ratings.

Motivation: 现有基于文本链式思维（CoT）的多模态大语言模型难以准确描述像素级伪造痕迹，易产生幻觉；语言模态不足以表征低层不可见篡改信号（如压缩历史、噪声残差、频域异常）。

Method: 提出ForgeryVCR框架，包含：1）forensic toolbox 将不可见痕迹转化为显式视觉中间表示；2）Strategic Tool Learning后训练范式，含增益驱动的监督微调轨迹构建与工具效用奖励引导的强化学习，支持模型自主调用局部放大、压缩分析、噪声/频域分析等多视角推理路径。

Conclusion: 视觉中心推理与策略性工具学习可有效克服文本CoT在细粒度图像取证中的固有局限，为MLLM在低层视觉理解任务中提供了新范式。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for image forgery detection and localization predominantly operate under a text-centric Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm. However, forcing these models to textually characterize imperceptible low-level tampering traces inevitably leads to hallucinations, as linguistic modalities are insufficient to capture such fine-grained pixel-level inconsistencies. To overcome this, we propose ForgeryVCR, a framework that incorporates a forensic toolbox to materialize imperceptible traces into explicit visual intermediates via Visual-Centric Reasoning. To enable efficient tool utilization, we introduce a Strategic Tool Learning post-training paradigm, encompassing gain-driven trajectory construction for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization guided by a tool utility reward. This paradigm empowers the MLLM to act as a proactive decision-maker, learning to spontaneously invoke multi-view reasoning paths including local zoom-in for fine-grained inspection and the analysis of invisible inconsistencies in compression history, noise residuals, and frequency domains. Extensive experiments reveal that ForgeryVCR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both detection and localization tasks, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness with minimal tool redundancy.

Result: 在多个实验中，GeoFusionLRM相比SOTA LRM基线，实现了更锐利的几何结构、更一致的法线分布和更高的重建保真度。

Conclusion: 几何线索的自反馈机制可有效提升LRM重建质量，无需额外监督，为单图像3D重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Single-image 3D reconstruction with large reconstruction models (LRMs) has advanced rapidly, yet reconstructions often exhibit geometric inconsistencies and misaligned details that limit fidelity. We introduce GeoFusionLRM, a geometry-aware self-correction framework that leverages the model's own normal and depth predictions to refine structural accuracy. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on features extracted from the input image, GeoFusionLRM feeds back geometric cues through a dedicated transformer and fusion module, enabling the model to correct errors and enforce consistency with the conditioning image. This design improves the alignment between the reconstructed mesh and the input views without additional supervision or external signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoFusionLRM achieves sharper geometry, more consistent normals, and higher fidelity than state-of-the-art LRM baselines.

Conclusion: EgoSound填补了自我中心多模态理解中声音建模的空白，推动MLLMs从‘看见’迈向‘真正听见’世界。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in vision-language understanding. Yet, human perception is inherently multisensory, integrating sight, sound, and motion to reason about the world. Among these modalities, sound provides indispensable cues about spatial layout, off-screen events, and causal interactions, particularly in egocentric settings where auditory and visual signals are tightly coupled. To this end, we introduce EgoSound, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate egocentric sound understanding in MLLMs. EgoSound unifies data from Ego4D and EgoBlind, encompassing both sighted and sound-dependent experiences. It defines a seven-task taxonomy spanning intrinsic sound perception, spatial localization, causal inference, and cross-modal reasoning. Constructed through a multi-stage auto-generative pipeline, EgoSound contains 7315 validated QA pairs across 900 videos. Comprehensive experiments on nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that current models exhibit emerging auditory reasoning abilities but remain limited in fine-grained spatial and causal understanding. EgoSound establishes a challenging foundation for advancing multisensory egocentric intelligence, bridging the gap between seeing and truly hearing the world.

Conclusion: 标准通用MLLM可通过简洁设计（如视觉令牌监督）直接胜任密集预测任务，无需架构碎片化，推动MLLM向真正统一、实用的通用感知模型发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in high-level visual understanding. However, extending these models to fine-grained dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, typically necessitates the incorporation of complex, task-specific decoders and other customizations. This architectural fragmentation increases model complexity and deviates from the generalist design of MLLMs, ultimately limiting their practicality. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by accommodating standard MLLMs to perform dense predictions without requiring additional task-specific decoders. The proposed model is called DenseMLLM, grounded in the standard architecture with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels and tasks. Despite its minimalist design, our model achieves highly competitive performance across a wide range of dense prediction and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that a standard, general-purpose MLLM can effectively support dense perception without architectural specialization.

Abstract: Traditional mechanized chestnut harvesting is too costly for small producers, non-selective, and prone to damaging nuts. Accurate, reliable detection of chestnuts on the orchard floor is crucial for developing low-cost, vision-guided automated harvesting technology. However, developing a reliable chestnut detection system faces challenges in complex environments with shading, varying natural light conditions, and interference from weeds, fallen leaves, stones, and other foreign on-ground objects, which have remained unaddressed. This study collected 319 images of chestnuts on the orchard floor, containing 6524 annotated chestnuts. A comprehensive set of 29 state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, including 14 in the YOLO (v11-13) and 15 in the RT-DETR (v1-v4) families at varied model scales, was systematically evaluated through replicated modeling experiments for chestnut detection. Experimental results show that the YOLOv12m model achieves the best mAP@0.5 of 95.1% among all the evaluated models, while the RT-DETRv2-R101 was the most accurate variant among RT-DETR models, with mAP@0.5 of 91.1%. In terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95], the YOLOv11x model achieved the best accuracy of 80.1%. All models demonstrate significant potential for real-time chestnut detection, and YOLO models outperformed RT-DETR models in terms of both detection accuracy and inference, making them better suited for on-board deployment. Both the dataset and software programs in this study have been made publicly available at https://github.com/AgFood-Sensing-and-Intelligence-Lab/ChestnutDetection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型在多模态理解和生成任务中仍依赖任务特定的强化学习，缺乏统一、可扩展的推理能力训练范式。

Method: 提出LaViDa-R1模型，采用统一后训练框架，融合监督微调（SFT）与多任务强化学习（RL），并引入答案强制（answer-forcing）、树搜索（tree search）和互补似然估计（complementary likelihood estimation）等新技术。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) recently emerged as a promising alternative to auto-regressive LLMs. The latest works further extended it to multimodal understanding and generation tasks. In this work, we propose LaViDa-R1, a multimodal, general-purpose reasoning dLLM. Unlike existing works that build reasoning dLLMs through task-specific reinforcement learning, LaViDa-R1 incorporates diverse multimodal understanding and generation tasks in a unified manner. In particular, LaViDa-R1 is built with a novel unified post-training framework that seamlessly integrates supervised finetuning (SFT) and multi-task reinforcement learning (RL). It employs several novel training techniques, including answer-forcing, tree search, and complementary likelihood estimation, to enhance effectiveness and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate LaViDa-R1's strong performance on a wide range of multimodal tasks, including visual math reasoning, reason-intensive grounding, and image editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ARport系统，利用光学透视头戴显示器实现无需外部传感器或标记的增强现实端口定位，将术前规划的套管针布局自动映射到患者体表，提升机器人辅助手术中端口放置的精度与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的套管针（port）放置是机器人辅助手术的关键步骤，而术前规划与术中执行之间存在差距，需要一种直观、准确且易集成的术前计划可视化方法。

Method: ARport基于光学透视头戴显示器（OST-HMD），融合RGB、深度和位姿数据重建手术场景；利用基础模型提取患者体表，并通过基于表面的无标记配准技术，将术前解剖模型对齐至实际体表，实现在体实时可视化预设套管针位点。

Conclusion: ARport是一种完全无标记、硬件需求极简的解决方案，可直接在患者体表可视化术前套管针规划，有助于提升术中准备效率，并具备融入常规临床工作流的潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Precise port placement is a critical step in robot-assisted surgery, where port configuration influences both visual access to the operative field and instrument maneuverability. To bridge the gap between preoperative planning and intraoperative execution, we present ARport, an augmented reality (AR) system that automatically maps pre-planned trocar layouts onto the patient's body surface, providing intuitive spatial guidance during surgical preparation. Methods: ARport, implemented on an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD), operates without any external sensors or markers, simplifying setup and enhancing workflow integration. It reconstructs the operative scene from RGB, depth, and pose data captured by the OST-HMD, extracts the patient's body surface using a foundation model, and performs surface-based markerless registration to align preoperative anatomical models to the extracted patient's body surface, enabling in-situ visualization of planned trocar layouts. A demonstration video illustrating the overall workflow is available online. Results: In full-scale human-phantom experiments, ARport accurately overlaid pre-planned trocar sites onto the physical phantom, achieving consistent spatial correspondence between virtual plans and real anatomy. Conclusion: ARport provides a fully marker-free and hardware-minimal solution for visualizing preoperative trocar plans directly on the patient's body surface. The system facilitates efficient intraoperative setup and demonstrates potential for seamless integration into routine clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需向量-雅可比乘积（VJP）计算的测试时引导方法，用于文本驱动的图像和视频编辑，在大规模基准上验证了其性能可媲美甚至超越训练式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散或流模型的测试时引导方法依赖计算代价高昂的向量-雅可比乘积（VJP）来近似不可行的引导项，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于Moufad等（2025）提出的VJP-free近似方法，提供理论分析并大幅扩展其在大规模图像与视频编辑任务上的实证评估。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用测试时引导即可达到与训练式方法相当甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: 测试时引导是一种高效且强大的替代方案，无需额外训练即可实现高质量文本驱动编辑。

Abstract: Text-driven image and video editing can be naturally cast as inpainting problems, where masked regions are reconstructed to remain consistent with both the observed content and the editing prompt. Recent advances in test-time guidance for diffusion and flow models provide a principled framework for this task; however, existing methods rely on costly vector--Jacobian product (VJP) computations to approximate the intractable guidance term, limiting their practical applicability. Building upon the recent work of Moufad et al. (2025), we provide theoretical insights into their VJP-free approximation and substantially extend their empirical evaluation to large-scale image and video editing benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that test-time guidance alone can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases surpass, training-based methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL)，一种空间转录组引导的、参数高效的病理视觉编码器自监督微调框架，将局部基因表达信息融入现有病理基础模型，在多项分子状态预测与跨模态任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组（ST）提供了空间分辨的基因表达数据，而多模态基础模型的成功表明形态与分子信息可耦合以增强病理图像表征；现有视觉-only模型缺乏对局部分子信号的建模能力。

Method: 提出SEAL框架，利用超70万个配对的空间表达spot-组织区域样本，对主流病理视觉编码器进行参数高效微调（无需从头训练），实现形态-分子联合表征学习。

Result: 在38个切片级和15个斑块级下游任务中，SEAL一致优于纯视觉及ST预测基线；具备强域外泛化能力，并支持基因到图像检索等新跨模态功能。

Conclusion: 将局部分子监督引入现有病理基础模型是一种有效且实用的改进策略，SEAL为ST指导的病理模型优化提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides spatially resolved measurements of gene expression, enabling characterization of the molecular landscape of human tissue beyond histological assessment as well as localized readouts that can be aligned with morphology. Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval. Our work proposes a general framework for ST-guided finetuning of pathology foundation models, showing that augmenting existing models with localized molecular supervision is an effective and practical step for improving visual representations and expanding their cross-modal utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉分词器难以在单一框架内同时满足高保真重建、复杂语义提取和生成适配性这三类相互冲突的目标，制约了统一多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的发展。

Method: 提出UniWeTok：采用128位大规模二进制码本；设计Pre-Post Distillation和Generative-Aware Prior提升语义提取与生成先验；构建卷积-注意力混合编码器，并引入SigLu激活函数以约束输出、稳定蒸馏并缓解熵损失与承诺损失的优化冲突；采用三阶段训练策略增强跨分辨率与感知敏感场景（如人脸、文本）的适应性。

Result: 在ImageNet上图像生成FID达1.38（优于REPA的1.42），训练token量仅33B（远低于REPA的262B）；在通用领域，多模态理解、图像生成（DPG 86.63 vs FLUX.1 83.84）和图像编辑（GEdit 5.09 vs OmniGen 5.06）均表现优异。

Conclusion: UniWeTok成功实现了高保真、强语义、易生成的统一视觉表征，为MLLM提供高效、鲁棒、可扩展的视觉分词基础，并开源代码与模型以推动社区发展。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require a visual representation that simultaneously supports high-fidelity reconstruction, complex semantic extraction, and generative suitability. However, existing visual tokenizers typically struggle to satisfy these conflicting objectives within a single framework. In this paper, we introduce UniWeTok, a unified discrete tokenizer designed to bridge this gap using a massive binary codebook ($\mathit{2^{128}}$). For training framework, we introduce Pre-Post Distillation and a Generative-Aware Prior to enhance the semantic extraction and generative prior of the discrete tokens. In terms of model architecture, we propose a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with the SigLu activation function. SigLu activation not only bounds the encoder output and stabilizes the semantic distillation process but also effectively addresses the optimization conflict between token entropy loss and commitment loss. We further propose a three-stage training framework designed to enhance UniWeTok's adaptability cross various image resolutions and perception-sensitive scenarios, such as those involving human faces and textual content. On ImageNet, UniWeTok achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance (FID: UniWeTok 1.38 vs. REPA 1.42) while requiring a remarkably low training compute (Training Tokens: UniWeTok 33B vs. REPA 262B). On general-domain, UniWeTok demonstrates highly competitive capabilities across a broad range of tasks, including multimodal understanding, image generation (DPG Score: UniWeTok 86.63 vs. FLUX.1 [Dev] 83.84), and editing (GEdit Overall Score: UniWeTok 5.09 vs. OmniGen 5.06). We release code and models to facilitate community exploration of unified tokenizer and MLLM.

TL;DR: 本文提出UniRef-Image-Edit，一种基于扩散模型的统一多模态图像编辑与合成系统，通过新提出的序列扩展潜在融合（SELF）表示和两阶段训练（监督微调+多源GRPO强化学习），显著提升多参考图像间的一致性与生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的图像编辑方法在处理多个参考图像时难以维持跨条件一致性，因参考输入间交互有限。

Method: 提出Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion（SELF）统一表示多个参考图像为固定长度潜序列，并在像素预算约束下联合训练；采用两阶段训练：1）监督微调（SFT），含渐进式序列长度训练（1024²→1536²→2048²）；2）多源GRPO（MSGRPO）强化学习，专为多参考生成设计，优化冲突视觉约束的协调。

Result: 实现了单图编辑与多图合成的统一高性能生成，在跨参考一致性、视觉保真度和 compositional consistency 上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: UniRef-Image-Edit 通过 SELF 表示与 MSGRPO 强化学习框架，有效解决了多参考图像生成中的一致性难题，为多模态图像编辑提供了可扩展、可复现的新范式，并将全部代码、模型与数据开源。

Abstract: We present UniRef-Image-Edit, a high-performance multi-modal generation system that unifies single-image editing and multi-image composition within a single framework. Existing diffusion-based editing methods often struggle to maintain consistency across multiple conditions due to limited interaction between reference inputs. To address this, we introduce Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion (SELF), a unified input representation that dynamically serializes multiple reference images into a coherent latent sequence. During a dedicated training stage, all reference images are jointly constrained to fit within a fixed-length sequence under a global pixel-budget constraint. Building upon SELF, we propose a two-stage training framework comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we jointly train on single-image editing and multi-image composition tasks to establish a robust generative prior. We adopt a progressive sequence length training strategy, in which all input images are initially resized to a total pixel budget of $1024^2$, and are then gradually increased to $1536^2$ and $2048^2$ to improve visual fidelity and cross-reference consistency. This gradual relaxation of compression enables the model to incrementally capture finer visual details while maintaining stable alignment across references. For the RL stage, we introduce Multi-Source GRPO (MSGRPO), to our knowledge the first reinforcement learning framework tailored for multi-reference image generation. MSGRPO optimizes the model to reconcile conflicting visual constraints, significantly enhancing compositional consistency. We will open-source the code, models, training data, and reward data for community research purposes.

TL;DR: 本文提出GeoEyes框架，通过分阶段训练（冷启动SFT + 自适应强化学习AdaZoom-GRPO）解决现有多模态大模型在超高清遥感图像视觉问答中工具调用同质化问题，显著提升细粒度视觉证据获取能力与准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有支持缩放的多模态大语言模型在超高清遥感VQA任务中存在‘工具使用同质化’问题——缩放行为趋于任务无关、缺乏针对性，导致难以有效捕获稀疏且微小的关键视觉线索。

Method: 提出GeoEyes：（1）构建涵盖多样缩放模式的冷启动监督微调数据集UHR Chain-of-Zoom（UHR-CoZ）；（2）设计基于证据增益与答案改进奖励的智能体式强化学习方法AdaZoom-GRPO。

Result: 模型实现按需缩放与合理终止，显著提升UHR遥感基准性能，在XLRS-Bench上达到54.23%准确率。

Conclusion: 分阶段训练（结构化数据+目标导向强化学习）可有效解耦缩放策略与任务语义，提升MLLM在超高清视觉理解中的主动感知能力。

Abstract: The "thinking-with-images" paradigm enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to actively explore visual scenes via zoom-in tools. This is essential for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing VQA, where task-relevant cues are sparse and tiny. However, we observe a consistent failure mode in existing zoom-enabled MLLMs: Tool Usage Homogenization, where tool calls collapse into task-agnostic patterns, limiting effective evidence acquisition. To address this, we propose GeoEyes, a staged training framework consisting of (1) a cold-start SFT dataset, UHR Chain-of-Zoom (UHR-CoZ), which covers diverse zooming regimes, and (2) an agentic reinforcement learning method, AdaZoom-GRPO, that explicitly rewards evidence gain and answer improvement during zoom interactions. The resulting model learns on-demand zooming with proper stopping behavior and achieves substantial improvements on UHR remote sensing benchmarks, with 54.23% accuracy on XLRS-Bench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiVid is a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as scalable human proxies to generate high-fidelity, content-aware importance weights for video streaming—supporting both VOD and live scenarios—by addressing modality limits, rating inconsistency, and low-latency online inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content-aware streaming needs accurate, chunk-level importance weights to optimize subjective QoE, but human annotation is too costly and vision-saliency models lack generalization.

Method: HiVid introduces three modules: (1) a perception module for local frame assessment and autoregressive video understanding; (2) a ranking module with an LLM-guided merge-sort algorithm for global re-ranking in VOD; (3) a prediction module using a multi-modal time series model with content-aware attention and adaptive horizon for low-latency live streaming.

Result: HiVid improves weight prediction accuracy by up to 11.5% (VOD) and 26% (live), and boosts QoE correlation by 14.7% in real-world user studies.

Conclusion: HiVid establishes LLMs as effective, scalable human proxies for importance weighting in streaming, significantly advancing content-aware adaptation for both VOD and live scenarios.

Abstract: Content-aware streaming requires dynamic, chunk-level importance weights to optimize subjective quality of experience (QoE). However, direct human annotation is prohibitively expensive while vision-saliency models generalize poorly. We introduce HiVid, the first framework to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as a scalable human proxy to generate high-fidelity weights for both Video-on-Demand (VOD) and live streaming. We address 3 non-trivial challenges: (1) To extend LLMs' limited modality and circumvent token limits, we propose a perception module to assess frames in a local context window, autoregressively building a coherent understanding of the video. (2) For VOD with rating inconsistency across local windows, we propose a ranking module to perform global re-ranking with a novel LLM-guided merge-sort algorithm. (3) For live streaming which requires low-latency, online inference without future knowledge, we propose a prediction module to predict future weights with a multi-modal time series model, which comprises a content-aware attention and adaptive horizon to accommodate asynchronous LLM inference. Extensive experiments show HiVid improves weight prediction accuracy by up to 11.5\% for VOD and 26\% for live streaming over SOTA baselines. Real-world user study validates HiVid boosts streaming QoE correlation by 14.7\%.

Motivation: 现有方法在静态场景中失效或依赖多帧运动线索，难以有效去除单张图像中的围栏遮挡，影响视觉质量和下游任务。

Method: 提出Freq-DP Net：双分支网络，一支建模基于双像素的散焦视差几何先验（显式代价体），另一支通过快速傅里叶卷积（FFC）学习围栏全局结构先验，并用注意力机制融合二者以实现精准围栏分割。

Conclusion: 利用双像素传感器的几何与频域结构信息可有效解决单图围栏去除难题，所提框架兼具创新性与实用性，并推动了该方向的数据与方法发展。

Abstract: Removing fence occlusions from single images is a challenging task that degrades visual quality and limits downstream computer vision applications. Existing methods often fail on static scenes or require motion cues from multiple frames. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first framework to leverage dual-pixel (DP) sensors for this problem. We propose Freq-DP Net, a novel dual-branch network that fuses two complementary priors: a geometric prior from defocus disparity, modeled using an explicit cost volume, and a structural prior of the fence's global pattern, learned via Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC). An attention mechanism intelligently merges these cues for highly accurate fence segmentation. To validate our approach, we build and release a diverse benchmark with different fence varieties. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong general-purpose baselines, establishing a new state-of-the-art for single-image, DP-based fence removal.

Motivation: 现有3D形状基准数据集主要关注几何信息，忽视了拓扑结构；需构建融合几何与拓扑的统一学习基准与方法。

Method: 构建含持久同调特征的拓扑增强点云数据集；提出TopoGAT——一种基于深度学习的显著持久点选择方法，利用图注意力机制从输入数据及拓扑签名中学习关键拓扑特征。

Conclusion: 所提出的拓扑增强数据集与可学习的显著特征选择方法，推动了持久同调在实际3D点云深度学习流程中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Geometry and topology constitute complementary descriptors of three-dimensional shape, yet existing benchmark datasets primarily capture geometric information while neglecting topological structure. This work addresses this limitation by introducing topologically-enriched versions of ModelNet40 and ShapeNet, where each point cloud is augmented with its corresponding persistent homology features. These benchmarks with the topological signatures establish a foundation for unified geometry-topology learning and enable systematic evaluation of topology-aware deep learning architectures for 3D shape analysis. Building on this foundation, we propose a deep learning-based significant persistent point selection method, \textit{TopoGAT}, that learns to identify the most informative topological features directly from input data and the corresponding topological signatures, circumventing the limitations of hand-crafted statistical selection criteria. A comparative study verifies the superiority of the proposed method over traditional statistical approaches in terms of stability and discriminative power. Integrating the selected significant persistent points into standard point cloud classification and part-segmentation pipelines yields improvements in both classification accuracy and segmentation metrics. The presented topologically-enriched datasets, coupled with our learnable significant feature selection approach, enable the broader integration of persistent homology into the practical deep learning workflows for 3D point cloud analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models在处理长视频时面临KV缓存随序列长度线性增长的内存瓶颈；现有反应式token剔除方法需先计算完整注意力矩阵，造成大量计算浪费。

Method: 提出Sali-Cache框架：结合基于光学流的时序滤波器（去除帧间冗余）和基于显著性检测的空间滤波器（保留关键视觉区域），在进入注意力计算前主动优化KV缓存。

Result: 在LLaVA 1.6上实现2.20x有效内存压缩率，BLEU/ROUGE-L/Exact Match保持100%；相同内存预算下可维持更长时序上下文且不降性能。

Conclusion: Sali-Cache通过先验、双信号的主动缓存管理，为消费级硬件高效处理长视频提供了可行路径，突破了VLM的内存瓶颈。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a critical memory bottleneck when processing long-form video content due to the linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache with sequence length. Existing solutions predominantly employ reactive eviction strategies that compute full attention matrices before discarding tokens, resulting in substantial computational waste. We propose Sali-Cache, a novel a priori optimization framework that implements dual-signal adaptive caching through proactive memory management. By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics. Furthermore, under identical memory budget constraints, Sali-Cache preserves context-rich features over extended temporal durations without degrading model performance, enabling efficient processing of long-form video content on consumer-grade hardware.

Method: 提出AbracADDbra框架：采用解耦架构，先用视觉-语言Transformer实现触控引导的定位，再用扩散模型联合生成目标对象和实例掩码；并构建Touch2Add交互式基准。

Result: 在评估中，该框架的定位模型显著优于随机定位和通用VLM基线；分析显示初始定位精度与最终编辑质量强相关。

Conclusion: AbracADDbra提升了指令驱动对象添加的易用性与精度，为高效创意工具的发展奠定基础。

Abstract: Instruction-based object addition is often hindered by the ambiguity of text-only prompts or the tedious nature of mask-based inputs. To address this usability gap, we introduce AbracADDbra, a user-friendly framework that leverages intuitive touch priors to spatially ground succinct instructions for precise placement. Our efficient, decoupled architecture uses a vision-language transformer for touch-guided placement, followed by a diffusion model that jointly generates the object and an instance mask for high-fidelity blending. To facilitate standardized evaluation, we contribute the Touch2Add benchmark for this interactive task. Our extensive evaluations, where our placement model significantly outperforms both random placement and general-purpose VLM baselines, confirm the framework's ability to produce high-fidelity edits. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between initial placement accuracy and final edit quality, validating our decoupled approach. This work thus paves the way for more accessible and efficient creative tools.

### [114] [Moving Beyond Sparse Grounding with Complete Screen Parsing Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14276)
*A. Said Gurbuz,Sunghwan Hong,Ahmed Nassar,Marc Pollefeys,Peter Staar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ScreenParse数据集和ScreenVLM模型，旨在实现对屏幕界面的密集、结构化解析，显著提升了UI元素识别与定位的准确率，并支持低延迟的设备端部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有屏幕理解数据集标注稀疏、多样性不足，难以覆盖全部UI元素，限制了模型泛化能力；同时实际部署需要高效、低延迟的模型。

Method: 构建了包含77.1万网页截图、2100万个UI元素的ScreenParse大规模密集标注数据集，并设计自动化流水线Webshot进行渲染、提取与VLM辅助重标注；基于该数据集训练轻量级视觉语言模型ScreenVLM（3.16亿参数），采用结构感知损失函数解码ScreenTag标记表示。

Result: ScreenVLM在ScreenParse上PageIoU达0.592，远超更大规模基础VLM（0.294）；在公开基准上迁移性能优异；且用ScreenParse微调其他基础VLM也能稳定提升其UI接地性能。

Conclusion: 密集、结构化的屏幕解析监督信号能有效提升模型对UI结构的理解能力，ScreenParse与ScreenVLM为高效、鲁棒的计算机使用代理提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Modern computer-use agents (CUA) must perceive a screen as a structured state, what elements are visible, where they are, and what text they contain, before they can reliably ground instructions and act. Yet, most available grounding datasets provide sparse supervision, with insufficient and low-diversity labels that annotate only a small subset of task-relevant elements per screen, which limits both coverage and generalization; moreover, practical deployment requires efficiency to enable low-latency, on-device use. We introduce ScreenParse, a large-scale dataset for complete screen parsing, with dense annotations of all visible UI elements (boxes, 55-class types, and text) across 771K web screenshots (21M elements). ScreenParse is generated by Webshot, an automated, scalable pipeline that renders diverse urls, extracts annotations and applies VLM-based relabeling and quality filtering. Using ScreenParse, we train ScreenVLM, a compact, 316M-parameter vision language model (VLM) that decodes a compact ScreenTag markup representation with a structure-aware loss that upweights structure-critical tokens. ScreenVLM substantially outperforms much larger foundation VLMs on dense parsing (e.g., 0.592 vs. 0.294 PageIoU on ScreenParse) and shows strong transfer to public benchmarks. Moreover, finetuning foundation VLMs on ScreenParse consistently improves their grounding performance, suggesting that dense screen supervision provides transferable structural priors for UI understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合光度误差与几何特征描述子的新型两帧相对位姿优化方法，通过密集采样的几何特征描述子替代传统光度误差，以期兼顾亚像素精度与描述子表达力；实验表明该方法虽能实现高精度跟踪，但整体性能仍不及基于重投影误差的优化策略，作者分析其主因在于描述子相似性度量变化缓慢，难以严格反映关键点定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决两帧相对位姿优化中光度误差与重投影误差之间的权衡问题，兼顾准确性、鲁棒性与闭环可能性，探索融合光度与几何特征优势的新范式。

Method: 采用密集采样的几何特征描述子构建描述子残差，替代传统光度误差，从而在微分光度法中引入亚像素精度，并保留几何描述子的强表达能力。

Result: 所提方法可实现准确的跟踪效果，但整体位姿优化性能仍未超越基于重投影误差的主流方法；进一步分析发现，描述子相似性度量变化过于平缓，与关键点定位精度缺乏严格对应关系。

Conclusion: 单纯融合光度与几何特征并不自动提升位姿优化性能；描述子的设计及其相似性度量需更紧密地耦合关键点几何精度，否则难以超越经典重投影误差范式。

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in computer vision is the two-frame relative pose optimization problem. Primarily, two different kinds of error values are used: photometric error and re-projection error. The selection of error value is usually directly dependent on the selection of feature paradigm, photometric features, or geometric features. It is a trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and the possibility of loop closing. We investigate a third method that combines the strengths of both paradigms into a unified approach. Using densely sampled geometric feature descriptors, we replace the photometric error with a descriptor residual from a dense set of descriptors, thereby enabling the employment of sub-pixel accuracy in differential photometric methods, along with the expressiveness of the geometric feature descriptor. Experiments show that although the proposed strategy is an interesting approach that results in accurate tracking, it ultimately does not outperform pose optimization strategies based on re-projection error despite utilizing more information. We proceed to analyze the underlying reason for this discrepancy and present the hypothesis that the descriptor similarity metric is too slowly varying and does not necessarily correspond strictly to keypoint placement accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于Stable Diffusion与LoRA微调的生成式数据增强方法，针对ISIC数据集中深肤色样本严重不足的问题，生成高质量、病变类型与肤色条件可控的合成皮肤镜图像，显著提升了皮肤癌分割与分类模型在深肤色人群上的性能与公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤癌AI诊断工具因训练数据中浅肤色样本占比过高（>70%）、深肤色样本过少（<8%），导致对深肤色人群诊断准确性低、公平性差，亟需解决皮肤色调不平衡问题。

Method: 提出基于Stable Diffusion的生成式增强流程：在ISIC深肤色子集上采用LoRA微调预训练模型，生成带病变类型和皮肤色调标签的合成皮肤镜图像；并将合成数据用于 lesion 分割（U-Net等）与二分类（EfficientNet-B0）下游任务。

Result: 分割任务中，使用增强数据训练的模型在真实测试集上IoU、Dice系数和边界精度均稳定提升；分类任务中，EfficientNet-B0达92.14%准确率。

Conclusion: 生成式AI驱动的数据增强可有效缓解皮肤镜数据中的肤色偏差，提升模型公平性与泛化能力，为医疗影像中的多样性建模提供新路径。

Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and early detection is critical for effective treatment. However, current AI diagnostic tools are often trained on datasets dominated by lighter skin tones, leading to reduced accuracy and fairness for people with darker skin. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks, contains over 70% light skin images while dark skins fewer than 8%. This imbalance poses a significant barrier to equitable healthcare delivery and highlights the urgent need for methods that address demographic diversity in medical imaging. This paper addresses this challenge of skin tone imbalance in automated skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. To overcome this, we present a generative augmentation pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the image dark-skin subset of the ISIC dataset and generates synthetic dermoscopic images conditioned on lesion type and skin tone. In this study, we investigated the utility of these images on two downstream tasks: lesion segmentation and binary classification. For segmentation, models trained on the augmented dataset and evaluated on held-out real images show consistent improvements in IoU, Dice coefficient, and boundary accuracy. These evalutions provides the verification of Generated dataset. For classification, an EfficientNet-B0 model trained on the augmented dataset achieved 92.14% accuracy. This paper demonstrates that synthetic data augmentation with Generative AI integration can substantially reduce bias with increase fairness in conventional dermatological diagnostics and open challenges for future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期诊断和持续监测类风湿关节炎（RA）至关重要，但患者常难以及时获得专科诊疗；现有方法未专门解决RGB图像中RA炎症检测所面临的样本稀缺、数据不平衡等挑战。

Method: 构建专用数据集定量分析视觉检测难度；提出融合全局-局部编码器的检测框架，采用大规模健康手部图像进行自监督预训练，并结合不平衡感知训练策略。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了RGB图像RA炎症检测中的数据稀缺与不平衡问题，为居家便捷筛查提供了可行技术路径。

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic joint inflammation. Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves F1-score by 0.2 points and Gmean by 0.25 points compared with the baseline model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种融合事件相机与帧图像的视觉形变测量方法，通过Affine Invariant Simplicial（AIS）建模与邻域贪心优化策略，在保证精度的同时大幅降低数据存储与计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的形变测量方法受限于帧间运动小的假设，难以处理高动态场景；使用高速相机则带来巨大的存储与计算负担。

Method: 提出事件-帧融合框架：利用事件提供高时间分辨率运动线索，帧图像提供高空间精度估计；引入基于固体弹性建模先验的Affine Invariant Simplicial（AIS）表示，将形变场划分为低参数线性子区域；设计邻域贪心优化策略以加速收敛并抑制局部误差累积。

Result: 在自建包含120+序列的基准数据集上，生存率较SOTA提升1.6%，且仅需高速视频方法18.9%的存储与计算资源。

Conclusion: 事件与帧的互补融合结合几何先验建模与高效优化策略，可显著提升视觉形变测量在高动态、资源受限场景下的实用性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual Deformation Measurement (VDM) aims to recover dense deformation fields by tracking surface motion from camera observations. Traditional image-based methods rely on minimal inter-frame motion to constrain the correspondence search space, which limits their applicability to highly dynamic scenes or necessitates high-speed cameras at the cost of prohibitive storage and computational overhead. We propose an event-frame fusion framework that exploits events for temporally dense motion cues and frames for spatially dense precise estimation. Revisiting the solid elastic modeling prior, we propose an Affine Invariant Simplicial (AIS) framework. It partitions the deformation field into linearized sub-regions with low-parametric representation, effectively mitigating motion ambiguities arising from sparse and noisy events. To speed up parameter searching and reduce error accumulation, a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy is introduced, enabling well-converged sub-regions to guide their poorly-converged neighbors, effectively suppress local error accumulation in long-term dense tracking. To evaluate the proposed method, a benchmark dataset with temporally aligned event streams and frames is established, encompassing over 120 sequences spanning diverse deformation scenarios. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 1.6% in survival rate. Remarkably, it achieves this using only 18.9% of the data storage and processing resources of high-speed video methods.

### [119] [Adapting VACE for Real-Time Autoregressive Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14381)
*Ryan Fosdick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于实时自回归视频生成的VACE模型改进版本，通过将参考帧移至并行条件路径，在保持原有预训练权重的同时支持流式处理和KV缓存，但牺牲了部分参考到视频的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VACE模型依赖全序列双向注意力，无法适配需要固定块大小和因果注意力的流式视频生成场景。

Method: 将参考帧从扩散隐空间迁移至独立的并行条件路径，保留固定chunk大小与KV缓存机制，复用原始预训练VACE权重，无需额外训练。

Result: 在1.3B和14B模型规模下，结构控制与修复任务引入20-30%延迟开销，显存消耗可忽略；但参考到视频保真度因因果注意力限制显著下降。

Conclusion: 该改进使VACE适配实时自回归视频生成，兼顾效率与兼容性，为流式可控视频生成提供了可行方案，但需权衡保真度损失。

Abstract: We describe an adaptation of VACE (Video All-in-one Creation and Editing) for real-time autoregressive video generation. VACE provides unified video control (reference guidance, structural conditioning, inpainting, and temporal extension) but assumes bidirectional attention over full sequences, making it incompatible with streaming pipelines that require fixed chunk sizes and causal attention. The key modification moves reference frames from the diffusion latent space into a parallel conditioning pathway, preserving the fixed chunk sizes and KV caching that autoregressive models require. This adaptation reuses existing pretrained VACE weights without additional training. Across 1.3B and 14B model scales, VACE adds 20-30% latency overhead for structural control and inpainting, with negligible VRAM cost relative to the base model. Reference-to-video fidelity is severely degraded compared to batch VACE due to causal attention constraints. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/daydreamlive/scope.

*In Chong Choi,Jiacheng Zhang,Feng Liu,Yiliao Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MAPA的多轮自适应提示攻击方法，用于有效绕过大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的安全防御机制。该方法通过在每轮中交替使用文本与视觉攻击动作，并在多轮间迭代优化攻击路径，显著提升了攻击成功率（提升11-35%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对LVLMs的多轮越狱攻击在引入视觉输入后易被安全对齐模型检测并防御，尤其是恶意视觉内容会触发保守响应，因此需要更隐蔽、自适应的攻击策略。

Method: 提出MAPA方法：1）单轮内交替执行文本与视觉攻击动作以激发最恶意响应；2）跨轮间通过迭代双向精炼动态调整攻击轨迹，逐步增强响应恶意性。

Result: 在多个主流LVLM（如LLaVA-V1.6-Mistral-7B、Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct等）上，MAPA将攻击成功率较SOTA方法提升11%-35%。

Conclusion: MAPA通过双层级自适应设计，显著提升了对LVLMs的多轮越狱攻击效果，揭示了当前LVLM安全机制在多模态交互场景下的脆弱性。

Abstract: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks are effective against text-only large language models (LLMs) by gradually introducing malicious content across turns. When extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), we find that naively adding visual inputs can cause existing multi-turn jailbreaks to be easily defended. For example, overly malicious visual input will easily trigger the defense mechanism of safety-aligned LVLMs, making the response more conservative. To address this, we propose MAPA: a multi-turn adaptive prompting attack that 1) at each turn, alternates text-vision attack actions to elicit the most malicious response; and 2) across turns, adjusts the attack trajectory through iterative back-and-forth refinement to gradually amplify response maliciousness. This two-level design enables MAPA to consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, improving attack success rates by 11-35% on recent benchmarks against LLaVA-V1.6-Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出pFedNavi，一种面向视觉-语言导航（VLN）的结构感知、动态自适应个性化联邦学习框架，通过层选择与细粒度参数融合，在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能与收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLN依赖大量来自私有室内环境的轨迹指令数据，存在严重隐私问题；而传统联邦学习（FL）难以应对VLN中环境与指令风格导致的极端跨客户端异构性，单一全局模型效果不佳。

Method: 提出pFedNavi框架，通过层级混合系数自适应识别客户端特异性层（如编码器-解码器投影层和环境敏感解码层），并在选定组件上进行细粒度参数融合，兼顾全局知识共享与本地专业化。

Result: 在R2R和RxR两个标准VLN基准上，使用ResNet和CLIP视觉表征验证，pFedNavi在所有指标上均超越FedAvg基线：导航成功率最高提升7.5%，轨迹保真度最高提升7.8%，非独立同分布条件下收敛速度快1.38倍。

Conclusion: pFedNavi有效缓解了VLN中隐私保护与模型个性化之间的矛盾，为异构环境下的分布式视觉语言任务提供了可扩展、高性能的联邦学习新范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation VLN requires large-scale trajectory instruction data from private indoor environments, raising significant privacy concerns. Federated Learning FL mitigates this by keeping data on-device, but vanilla FL struggles under VLNs' extreme cross-client heterogeneity in environments and instruction styles, making a single global model suboptimal. This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations. Across all metrics, pFedNavi consistently outperforms the FedAvg-based VLN baseline, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in navigation success rate and up to 7.8% gain in trajectory fidelity, while converging 1.38x faster under non-IID conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal methods are widely used in rice deterioration detection, which exhibit limited capability in representing and extracting fine-grained abnormal features. Moreover, these methods rely on devices, such as hyperspectral cameras and mass spectrometers, increasing detection costs and prolonging data acquisition time. To address these issues, we propose a feature recalibration based olfactory-visual multimodal model for fine-grained rice deterioration detection. The fine-grained deterioration embedding constructor (FDEC) is proposed to reconstruct the labeled multimodal embedded-feature dataset, enhancing sample representation. The fine-grained deterioration recalibration attention network (FDRA-Net) is proposed to emphasize signal variations and increase sensitivity to fine-grained deterioration on the rice surface. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.89%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the detection accuracy is improved and the procedure is simplified. Furthermore, field detection demonstrates the advantages of accuracy and operational simplicity. The proposed method can also be extended to other agrifood in agriculture and food industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了学习与几何方法在空间感知（特别是相对相机姿态估计）中的协同作用，提出一种端到端模块化框架：学习模块生成几何假设（如位姿、深度），几何模块（如ICP）进行最终决策；实验表明，单纯依赖学习提案不可靠，但经几何对齐并由几何后端处理时，可提升中等难度刚性场景的性能，强调了几何作为‘仲裁者’的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学习方法虽具强表征能力，但是否应直接替代几何估计，还是作为几何流水线中的中间模块，尚无定论；本文旨在填补该设计范式上的空白。

Method: 提出端到端模块化框架：用VGGT等学习模型生成位姿与深度提案，在RGB-D序列上结合经典点到面ICP作为几何后端；系统性评估不同运动幅度和场景动态下的提案可靠性与几何对齐影响。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准上发现三点：(1) 学习位姿提案单独使用不可靠；(2) 未对齐相机内参的学习深度提案会损害性能；(3) 几何对齐的学习深度+几何后端可在中等挑战性刚性场景中稳定提升性能。

Conclusion: 几何模块不应仅作为后处理 refinement，而是起关键验证与融合作用的‘仲裁者’；鲁棒的空间感知需采用模块化、几何感知的系统设计。

Abstract: Spatial perception aims to estimate camera motion and scene structure from visual observations, a problem traditionally addressed through geometric modeling and physical consistency constraints. Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated strong representational capacity for geometric perception and are increasingly used to augment classical geometry-centric systems in practice. However, whether learning components should directly replace geometric estimation or instead serve as intermediate modules within such pipelines remains an open question.
  In this work, we address this gap and investigate an end-to-end modular framework for effective spatial reasoning, where learning proposes geometric hypotheses, while geometric algorithms dispose estimation decisions. In particular, we study this principle in the context of relative camera pose estimation on RGB-D sequences. Using VGGT as a representative learning model, we evaluate learning-based pose and depth proposals under varying motion magnitudes and scene dynamics, followed by a classical point-to-plane RGB-D ICP as the geometric backend. Our experiments on the TUM RGB-D benchmark reveal three consistent findings: (1) learning-based pose proposals alone are unreliable; (2) learning-proposed geometry, when improperly aligned with camera intrinsics, can degrade performance; and (3) when learning-proposed depth is geometrically aligned and followed by a geometric disposal stage, consistent improvements emerge in moderately challenging rigid settings.
  These results demonstrate that geometry is not merely a refinement component, but an essential arbiter that validates and absorbs learning-based geometric observations. Our study highlights the importance of modular, geometry-aware system design for robust spatial perception.

Conclusion: HiVA通过融合多粒度视觉特征与精细化语言语义，显著提升了AU检测的准确性、鲁棒性与可解释性，为面部行为分析提供了新范式。

Abstract: Facial Action Unit (AU) detection seeks to recognize subtle facial muscle activations as defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). A primary challenge w.r.t AU detection is the effective learning of discriminative and generalizable AU representations under conditions of limited annotated data. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding (HiVA) method, which leverages textual AU descriptions as semantic priors to guide and enhance AU detection. Specifically, HiVA employs a large language model to generate diverse and contextually rich AU descriptions to strengthen language-based representation learning. To capture both fine-grained and holistic vision-language associations, HiVA introduces an AU-aware dynamic graph module that facilitates the learning of AU-specific visual representations. These features are further integrated within a hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture comprising two complementary mechanisms: Disentangled Dual Cross-Attention (DDCA), which establishes fine-grained, AU-specific interactions between visual and textual features, and Contextual Dual Cross-Attention (CDCA), which models global inter-AU dependencies. This collaborative, cross-modal learning paradigm enables HiVA to leverage multi-grained vision-based AU features in conjunction with refined language-based AU details, culminating in robust and semantically enriched AU detection capabilities. Extensive experiments show that HiVA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, qualitative analyses reveal that HiVA produces semantically meaningful activation patterns, highlighting its efficacy in learning robust and interpretable cross-modal correspondences for comprehensive facial behavior analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出D-SECURE框架，融合内部篡改检测（HAMMER）与外部证据推理（DEFAME），以提升多模态虚假信息检测能力，兼顾局部不一致性识别与全局事实核查，并提供可解释的统一报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统存在割裂：内容型检测器无法判断全局事实真伪，检索型事实核查器易忽略细粒度视觉或文本篡改，导致内部一致的伪造内容被漏检。

Method: 将HAMMER篡改检测器与DEFAME检索验证流水线结合，构建D-SECURE框架；DEFAME负责广域事实核查，HAMMER专精于处理DEFAME存疑或不确定的残差案例，聚焦像素级或词元级篡改分析。

Result: 在DGM4和ClaimReview数据集上的实验表明，二者能力互补，融合后显著提升多模态虚假新闻检测性能，并生成融合篡改线索与外部证据的统一可解释报告。

Conclusion: 内部操纵检测与外部证据推理的协同是解决多模态虚假信息的关键路径，D-SECURE为新闻类多模态帖子提供了更鲁棒、可解释的联合验证范式。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation increasingly mixes realistic im-age edits with fluent but misleading text, producing persuasive posts that are difficult to verify. Existing systems usually rely on a single evidence source. Content-based detectors identify local inconsistencies within an image and its caption but cannot determine global factual truth. Retrieval-based fact-checkers reason over external evidence but treat inputs as coarse claims and often miss subtle visual or textual manipulations. This separation creates failure cases where internally consistent fabrications bypass manipulation detectors and fact-checkers verify claims that contain pixel-level or token-level corruption. We present D-SECURE, a framework that combines internal manipulation detection with external evidence-based reasoning for news-style posts. D-SECURE integrates the HAMMER manipulation detector with the DEFAME retrieval pipeline. DEFAME performs broad verification, and HAMMER analyses residual or uncertain cases that may contain fine-grained edits. Experiments on DGM4 and ClaimReview samples highlight the complementary strengths of both systems and motivate their fusion.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于简化矢量图形（VGs）的分层可控图像生成方法，通过将图像解析为语义对齐、结构一致的VG表示，并以此指导图像合成，实现对形状、颜色和物体级别的精确编辑与高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 首先将图像高效解析为层次化、语义对齐且结构一致的简化矢量图形（VGs）表示；再构建以VG为引导的新型图像合成框架，结合VG的结构/语义特征与噪声预测，支持用户自由编辑并生成逼真图像。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了基于矢量图形引导的可控图像生成新范式，显著提升了几何、颜色及语义层面的编辑精度与灵活性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have achieved remarkable visual quality, while a fundamental challenge remains: Can image generation be controlled at the element level, enabling intuitive modifications such as adjusting shapes, altering colors, or adding and removing objects? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing layer-wise controllable generation through simplified vector graphics (VGs). Our approach first efficiently parses images into hierarchical VG representations that are semantic-aligned and structurally coherent. Building on this representation, we design a novel image synthesis framework guided by VGs, allowing users to freely modify elements and seamlessly translate these edits into photorealistic outputs. By leveraging the structural and semantic features of VGs in conjunction with noise prediction, our method provides precise control over geometry, color, and object semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diverse applications, including image editing, object-level manipulation, and fine-grained content creation, establishing a new paradigm for controllable image generation.

*Wenbo Nie,Zixiang Li,Renshuai Tao,Bin Wu,Yunchao Wei,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出CoCoDiff，一种无需训练、低成本的图像风格迁移框架，利用预训练潜在扩散模型实现细粒度、语义一致的风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多在全局层面操作，忽略了区域级甚至像素级的语义对应关系，难以在风格迁移中保持语义一致性。

Method: CoCoDiff提出像素级语义对应模块，从扩散模型中间特征中构建内容图与风格图之间的稠密对齐映射；并引入循环一致性模块，在迭代中强制结构与感知对齐。

Result: CoCoDiff在无需额外训练或监督的情况下，实现了最先进的视觉质量和定量结果，优于依赖额外训练或标注的方法。

Conclusion: CoCoDiff证明了利用预训练扩散模型中的隐含对应线索，可在零训练前提下实现高质量、语义一致的细粒度风格迁移。

Abstract: Transferring visual style between images while preserving semantic correspondence between similar objects remains a central challenge in computer vision. While existing methods have made great strides, most of them operate at global level but overlook region-wise and even pixel-wise semantic correspondence. To address this, we propose CoCoDiff, a novel training-free and low-cost style transfer framework that leverages pretrained latent diffusion models to achieve fine-grained, semantically consistent stylization. We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail. Despite requiring no additional training or supervision, CoCoDiff delivers state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative results, outperforming methods that rely on extra training or annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TikArt（Thinking Aperture），一种基于孔径引导的多步视觉-语言推理代理，通过Zoom和Segment两种孔径操作聚焦图像局部区域，并将观察结果转化为语言记忆，结合AGRPO强化学习算法优化推理策略，在细粒度视觉推理任务上显著提升性能并增强可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在细粒度视觉推理中依赖单一全局图像编码，难以捕捉微小物体、杂乱区域或细微标记等关键证据。

Method: 提出TikArt代理，构建Think-Aperture-Observe循环：语言生成→Zoom（矩形裁剪）或Segment（SAM2掩码裁剪）→生成显式观察描述；基于Qwen3-VL-8B，采用两阶段AGRPO强化学习（先预热分割动作，再联合优化视觉数学、细粒度VQA和分割任务），奖励函数兼顾任务成功与孔径使用的合理性。

Result: 在V*、HR-Bench-4K/8K、MME-RealWorld-Lite、MMStar、RefCOCO、ReasonSeg等多个基准上均超越基线模型，生成可解释的孔径轨迹，支持高分辨率细粒度推理。

Conclusion: TikArt验证了将局部视觉聚焦建模为可控决策过程的有效性，为MLLMs的细粒度、高分辨率多模态推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: We address fine-grained visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), where key evidence may reside in tiny objects, cluttered regions, or subtle markings that are lost under a single global image encoding. We introduce TikArt (Thinking Aperture), an aperture-guided agent that casts multi-step vision-language reasoning as a decision process over regions of interest. TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoom extracts rectangular crops, while Segment invokes SAM2 to obtain mask-based crops for irregular targets. After every action, the model must produce an explicit observation, turning local visual cues into persistent linguistic memory. Built on Qwen3-VL-8B, TikArt optimizes its reasoning policy with AGRPO, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with a two-stage curriculum: it warms up segmentation actions and then jointly optimizes visual math, fine-grained VQA, and segmentation, using rewards that couple task success with purposeful aperture use. Experiments on V*, HR-Bench-4K/8K, MME-RealWorld-Lite, MMStar, RefCOCO, and ReasonSeg show consistent gains over the backbone and yield interpretable aperture trajectories for high-resolution reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce a novel uncertainty-aware multimodal segmentation framework that leverages both radiological images and associated clinical text for precise medical diagnosis. We propose a Modality Decoding Attention Block (MoDAB) with a lightweight State Space Mixer (SSMix) to enable efficient cross-modal fusion and long-range dependency modelling. To guide learning under ambiguity, we propose the Spectral-Entropic Uncertainty (SEU) Loss, which jointly captures spatial overlap, spectral consistency, and predictive uncertainty in a unified objective. In complex clinical circumstances with poor image quality, this formulation improves model reliability. Extensive experiments on various publicly available medical datasets, QATA-COVID19, MosMed++, and Kvasir-SEG, demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance while being significantly more computationally efficient than existing State-of-the-Art (SoTA) approaches. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty modelling and structured modality alignment in vision-language medical segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的原型实例语义解耦框架PID-LRSC，通过低秩正则化子空间聚类和增强对比学习，解决病理全切片图像中肿瘤区域识别面临的实例-语义纠缠问题，提升模型表征能力与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤区域在病理诊断中至关重要，但其与癌前病变高度相似，且非肿瘤实例数量远超肿瘤实例，导致多实例学习中出现实例-语义纠缠，削弱模型表征力与可解释性。

Method: 提出PID-LRSC框架：1）采用二次实例子空间学习构建低秩正则化子空间聚类（LRSC），缓解非肿瘤实例占比过高引起的实例纠缠；2）设计增强对比学习实现原型实例语义解耦（PID），缓解肿瘤与癌前组织高相似性导致的语义纠缠。

Result: 在多中心病理数据集上实验表明，PID-LRSC优于其他SOTA方法，决策过程具备更清晰的实例语义，显著提升辅助诊断结果的可靠性。

Conclusion: PID-LRSC有效解耦实例与语义信息，兼顾模型性能与可解释性，为病理WSI分析提供了更可靠、更具临床意义的AI辅助诊断方案。

Abstract: The tumor region plays a key role in pathological diagnosis. Tumor tissues are highly similar to precancerous lesions and non tumor instances often greatly exceed tumor instances in whole slide images (WSIs). These issues cause instance-semantic entanglement in multi-instance learning frameworks, degrading both model representation capability and interpretability. To address this, we propose an end-to-end prototype instance semantic disentanglement framework with low-rank regularized subspace clustering, PID-LRSC, in two aspects. First, we use secondary instance subspace learning to construct low-rank regularized subspace clustering (LRSC), addressing instance entanglement caused by an excessive proportion of non tumor instances. Second, we employ enhanced contrastive learning to design prototype instance semantic disentanglement (PID), resolving semantic entanglement caused by the high similarity between tumor and precancerous tissues. We conduct extensive experiments on multicentre pathology datasets, implying that PID-LRSC outperforms other SOTA methods. Overall, PID-LRSC provides clearer instance semantics during decision-making and significantly enhances the reliability of auxiliary diagnostic outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的多实例学习（MIL）框架，结合Grassmann重嵌入与流形自适应聚类，提升全切片图像（WSI）病理诊断的准确性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两步式框架缺乏领域知识，注意力机制MIL方法结果导向但可解释性差，聚类方法虽可解释但受高维特征和语义模糊中心影响。

Method: 提出端到端MIL框架，融合Grassmann重嵌入与流形自适应聚类，并设计先验知识引导的代理实例标注与聚合策略，以逼近补丁标签并聚焦病理性相关肿瘤区域。

Result: 在多中心WSI数据集上实验表明：1）所提聚类融合模型在分级准确率与可解释性上均优于基线；2）端到端学习能优化特征表示，且计算开销可控。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高效性的同时显著提升了WSI分析的性能与临床可解释性，为病理AI提供了新范式。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are the gold standard for pathological diagnosis and sub-typing. Current main-stream two-step frameworks employ offline feature encoders trained without domain-specific knowledge. Among them, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods are outcome-oriented and offer limited interpretability. Clustering-based approaches can provide explainable decision-making process but suffer from high dimension features and semantically ambiguous centroids. To this end, we propose an end-to-end MIL framework that integrates Grassmann re-embedding and manifold adaptive clustering, where the manifold geometric structure facilitates robust clustering results. Furthermore, we design a prior knowledge guiding proxy instance labeling and aggregation strategy to approximate patch labels and focus on pathologically relevant tumor regions. Experiments on multicentre WSI datasets demonstrate that: 1) our cluster-incorporated model achieves superior performance in both grading accuracy and interpretability; 2) end-to-end learning refines better feature representations and it requires acceptable computation resources.

Motivation: 当前医学影像生成方法在架构效率、多器官数据规模和评估体系方面存在不足，难以支持可扩展的生成主干网络开发。

Method: 提出MedVAR模型，采用自回归架构与下一尺度预测范式，进行由粗到细的分层图像生成；构建包含约44万CT/MRI图像、覆盖6个解剖区域的统一多尺度医学影像数据集以支撑训练。

Result: 在保真度、多样性与可扩展性等多维度评测中，MedVAR达到当前最优生成性能，并产出适用于下游任务的结构化多尺度表征。

Conclusion: MedVAR为医学生成式基础模型提供了新的高效、可扩展架构范式，推动低资源临床任务的数据增强与隐私保护数据共享。

Abstract: Medical image generation is pivotal in applications like data augmentation for low-resource clinical tasks and privacy-preserving data sharing. However, developing a scalable generative backbone for medical imaging requires architectural efficiency, sufficient multi-organ data, and principled evaluation, yet current approaches leave these aspects unresolved. Therefore, we introduce MedVAR, the first autoregressive-based foundation model that adopts the next-scale prediction paradigm to enable fast and scale-up-friendly medical image synthesis. MedVAR generates images in a coarse-to-fine manner and produces structured multi-scale representations suitable for downstream use. To support hierarchical generation, we curate a harmonized dataset of around 440,000 CT and MRI images spanning six anatomical regions. Comprehensive experiments across fidelity, diversity, and scalability show that MedVAR achieves state-of-the-art generative performance and offers a promising architectural direction for future medical generative foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Nexus Adapters，一种面向扩散模型的高效文本引导适配器，用于结构保持的条件图像生成（SPCG），通过引入跨注意力机制实现对文本提示和结构输入（如草图、深度图）的联合建模，在显著减少参数量的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构保持的条件生成方法效率低，适配器参数量常与基模型相当，且无法感知文本提示，导致仅优化结构输入而忽略提示语义。

Method: 提出两种高效适配器：Nexus Prime 和 Nexus Slim；每个 Nexus Block 引入跨注意力机制，实现文本提示与结构输入的多模态联合条件建模。

Result: Nexus Prime 仅增加 8M 参数即显著超越 T2I-Adapter；Nexus Slim 比 T2I-Adapter 少 18M 参数，仍达到 SOTA 性能。

Conclusion: Nexus Adapters 在保证结构保真度的同时，实现了更高效、更语义感知的条件图像生成，为轻量化多模态扩散适配提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce the Nexus Adapters, novel text-guided efficient adapters to the diffusion-based framework for the Structure Preserving Conditional Generation (SPCG). Recently, structure-preserving methods have achieved promising results in conditional image generation by using a base model for prompt conditioning and an adapter for structure input, such as sketches or depth maps. These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter. Furthermore, we also introduced a lightweight Nexus Slim adapter with 18M fewer parameters than the T2I-Adapter, which still achieved state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统性实验框架，评估79种开源深度学习模型在龙卷风灾害图像损伤识别任务上的性能，发现优化器选择（如SGD优于Adam）和学习率（1e-4）比网络架构本身更重要，并在新构建的QSTD数据集及跨事件TMTD数据集上验证了最优配置（ConvNeXt-Base+SGD+1e-4）的优越泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化方法难以应对龙卷风灾后图像特有的视觉复杂性，主因是预训练数据与真实灾害场景间存在严重域偏移，且灾害数据中类别极度不平衡。

Method: 构建Quad-State Tornado Damage (QSTD)基准数据集；系统评估79种CNN与ViT类模型，在2300+次受控实验中分析架构、优化器、学习率等关键因素影响；验证跨事件泛化能力（TMTD数据集）。

Result: 发现优化器选择（SGD vs Adam）可带来+25~+38点F1提升，低学习率（1e-4）平均提升+10.2点F1；最优模型ConvNeXt-Base在TMTD上达46.4% Macro F1（+34.6）和85.5% Ordinal Top-1 Accuracy。

Conclusion: 龙卷风建筑损毁评估的性能瓶颈不在模型架构本身，而在于训练策略（尤其是优化器与学习率）的精细调优；该发现为灾害响应AI系统提供了可复现、高鲁棒性的实践范式。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate building damage assessment in the immediate aftermath of tornadoes is critical for coordinating life-saving search and rescue operations, optimizing emergency resource allocation, and accelerating community recovery. However, current automated methods struggle with the unique visual complexity of tornado-induced wreckage, primarily due to severe domain shift from standard pre-training datasets and extreme class imbalance in real-world disaster data. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic experimental framework evaluating 79 open-source deep learning models, encompassing both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers, across over 2,300 controlled experiments on our newly curated Quad-State Tornado Damage (QSTD) benchmark dataset. Our findings reveal that achieving operational-grade performance hinges on a complex interaction between architecture and optimization, rather than architectural selection alone. Most strikingly, we demonstrate that optimizer choice can be more consequential than architecture: switching from Adam to SGD provided dramatic F1 gains of +25 to +38 points for Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer families, fundamentally reversing their ranking from bottom-tier to competitive with top-performing CNNs. Furthermore, a low learning rate of 1x10^(-4) proved universally critical, boosting average F1 performance by +10.2 points across all architectures. Our champion model, ConvNeXt-Base trained with these optimized settings, demonstrated strong cross-event generalization on the held-out Tuscaloosa-Moore Tornado Damage (TMTD) dataset, achieving 46.4% Macro F1 (+34.6 points over baseline) and retaining 85.5% Ordinal Top-1 Accuracy despite temporal and sensor domain shifts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了TrOCR和Qwen两种模型在18世纪英文文本OCR任务中的表现，发现尽管Qwen在CER/WER上更优且对退化输入更鲁棒，但存在隐性正则化问题；而TrOCR虽正字法保真度更高，却易发生级联错误。研究强调需基于架构特性进行历史文献数字化的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 18世纪印刷文本OCR面临印刷质量差、古体字和拼写不规范等挑战，现有指标（如CER/WER）难以反映模型对学术研究的可靠性。

Method: 采用长度加权准确率和假设驱动的错误分析方法，对比专用OCR模型TrOCR与通用视觉语言模型Qwen在线级历史英文文本上的表现。

Result: Qwen在CER/WER上更低、对退化输入更鲁棒，但存在选择性语言正则化和拼写归一化；TrOCR正字法保真度更高，但易发生级联错误；两类模型错误在局部性、可检测性和学术风险上差异显著。

Conclusion: OCR模型的架构先验会系统性影响错误结构，相似总体准确率的模型可能带来截然不同的下游学术风险，因此需开展架构感知的历史文献OCR评估。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of eighteenth-century printed texts remains challenging due to degraded print quality, archaic glyphs, and non-standardized orthography. Although transformer-based OCR systems and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong aggregate accuracy, metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) provide limited insight into their reliability for scholarly use. We compare a dedicated OCR transformer (TrOCR) and a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (Qwen) on line-level historical English texts using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis driven error analysis.
  While Qwen achieves lower CER/WER and greater robustness to degraded input, it exhibits selective linguistic regularization and orthographic normalization that may silently alter historically meaningful forms. TrOCR preserves orthographic fidelity more consistently but is more prone to cascading error propagation. Our findings show that architectural inductive biases shape OCR error structure in systematic ways. Models with similar aggregate accuracy can differ substantially in error locality, detectability, and downstream scholarly risk, underscoring the need for architecture-aware evaluation in historical digitization workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR语义分割域泛化方法假设源域与目标域采集视角相似（如车载），难以应对因视角差异导致的结构不完整性与点云密度不均等跨视角场景。

Method: 提出CVGC框架：1）跨视角几何增强模块，模拟视角变化引起的可见性与采样密度变化，生成同一场景的多视角点云；2）几何一致性模块，强制同一场景下不同几何增强点云的语义与占据预测一致。

Result: 在六个公开LiDAR数据集上进行了系统评估，CVGC在单源域到多异构视角目标域的泛化任务中持续优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: CVGC有效提升了LiDAR语义分割模型在跨视角域泛化任务中的鲁棒性与泛化能力，为真实场景中多样化部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Domain-generalized LiDAR semantic segmentation (LSS) seeks to train models on source-domain point clouds that generalize reliably to multiple unseen target domains, which is essential for real-world LiDAR applications. However, existing approaches assume similar acquisition views (e.g., vehicle-mounted) and struggle in cross-view scenarios, where observations differ substantially due to viewpoint-dependent structural incompleteness and non-uniform point density. Accordingly, we formulate cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation and propose a novel framework, termed CVGC (Cross-View Geometric Consistency). Specifically, we introduce a cross-view geometric augmentation module that models viewpoint-induced variations in visibility and sampling density, generating multiple cross-view observations of the same scene. Subsequently, a geometric consistency module enforces consistent semantic and occupancy predictions across geometrically augmented point clouds of the same scene. Extensive experiments on six public LiDAR datasets establish the first systematic evaluation of cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation, demonstrating that CVGC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods when generalizing from a single source domain to multiple target domains with heterogeneous acquisition viewpoints.

Abstract: Human motion understanding and generation are crucial for vision and robotics but remain limited in reasoning capability and test-time planning. We propose MoRL, a unified multimodal motion model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

We also construct two large-scale CoT datasets, MoUnd-CoT-140K and MoGen-CoT-140K, to align motion sequences with reasoning traces and action descriptions. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that MoRL achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MoRL.

Abstract: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) concerns the synthesis of realistic person imagery through garment re-rendering under human pose and body constraints. In practice, however, existing approaches are typically optimized for specific data conditions, making their deployment reliant on retraining and limiting their generalization as a unified solution. We present OmniVTON++, a training-free VTON framework designed for universal applicability. It addresses the intertwined challenges of garment alignment, human structural coherence, and boundary continuity by coordinating Structured Garment Morphing for correspondence-driven garment adaptation, Principal Pose Guidance for step-wise structural regulation during diffusion sampling, and Continuous Boundary Stitching for boundary-aware refinement, forming a cohesive pipeline without task-specific retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse generalization settings, including cross-dataset and cross-garment-type evaluations, while reliably operating across scenarios and diffusion backbones within a single formulation. In addition to single-garment, single-human cases, the framework supports multi-garment, multi-human, and anime character virtual try-on, expanding the scope of virtual try-on applications. The source code will be released to the public.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving increasingly adopt generative planners trained with imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文深入分析了YOLO26的架构，重点介绍其在损失函数、推理流程、标签分配及优化器等方面的创新改进，旨在提升边缘设备上的实时性能，并首次系统揭示其CNN核心架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升YOLO系列模型在边缘设备（无GPU）上的实时推理性能，并填补YOLO26核心架构细节缺乏公开深入分析的空白。

Method: 基于YOLO26官方GitHub源码与文档，开展严谨的架构逆向分析，提取并梳理其关键组件：取消DFL、端到端NMS-Free推理、ProgLoss+STAL标签分配、MuSGD优化器，并构建完整架构图。

Result: 首次提出并公开YOLO26的CNN基础架构图，明确其在目标检测之外对实例分割、姿态估计和定向边界框解码的支持能力，验证CPU推理速度提升43%。

Conclusion: YOLO26通过多项结构与训练策略创新显著增强边缘部署能力，本研究为其后续改进提供了准确、可复现的架构理解基础。

Abstract: You Only Look Once (YOLO) has been the prominent model for computer vision in deep learning for a decade. This study explores the novel aspects of YOLO26, the most recent version in the YOLO series. The elimination of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), implementation of End-to-End NMS-Free Inference, introduction of ProgLoss + Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and use of the MuSGD optimizer are the primary enhancements designed to improve inference speed, which is claimed to achieve a 43% boost in CPU mode. This is designed to allow YOLO26 to attain real-time performance on edge devices or those without GPUs. Additionally, YOLO26 offers improvements in many computer vision tasks, including instance segmentation, pose estimation, and oriented bounding box (OBB) decoding. We aim for this effort to provide more value than just consolidating information already included in the existing technical documentation. Therefore, we performed a rigorous architectural investigation into YOLO26, mostly using the source code available in its GitHub repository and its official documentation. The authentic and detailed operational mechanisms of YOLO26 are inside the source code, which is seldom extracted by others. The YOLO26 architectural diagram is shown as the outcome of the investigation. This study is, to our knowledge, the first one presenting the CNN-based YOLO26 architecture, which is the core of YOLO26. Our objective is to provide a precise architectural comprehension of YOLO26 for researchers and developers aspiring to enhance the YOLO model, ensuring it remains the leading deep learning model in computer vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VariViT，一种能处理可变尺寸图像的改进型Vision Transformer，通过新的位置编码缩放方案和批处理策略，在保持固定patch大小的同时提升医学影像（如脑MRI）特征表示能力，并在胶质瘤基因型预测与脑肿瘤分类任务中超越标准ViT和ResNet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT要求固定尺寸图像输入，导致医学影像（如不规则肿瘤）需裁剪或缩放，易损失信息、引入伪影，且存在计算-精度权衡问题。

Method: 提出VariViT模型：1）设计适配可变patch数量的位置编码重采样机制；2）引入新型批处理策略以降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在两个3D脑MRI数据集上，VariViT在胶质瘤基因型预测和脑肿瘤分类任务中F1分数分别达75.5%和76.3%，优于ViT和ResNet；新批处理策略使计算时间减少最多30%。

Conclusion: VariViT有效解决了ViT在医学影像中对图像尺寸敏感的问题，提升了特征判别力与计算效率，验证了其在可变尺寸医学图像表征学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture in representation learning, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to excel in various tasks. ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将多模态幻觉视为统一问题，缺乏细粒度分类与可解释的评估方法，本文旨在填补这一评估空白。

Method: 提出VIGIL基准数据集与多阶段检测框架，按对象粘贴幻觉、背景幻觉、对象遗漏、位置与逻辑不一致、物理定律违反五类分解幻觉；利用开源模型协同集成，分步检测对象保真度、背景一致性与遗漏。

Conclusion: VIGIL首次系统性地对多模态图像重语境化幻觉进行细粒度归因与检测，推动了LMMs可信评估的发展，并通过完全开源促进社区进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce VIGIL (Visual Inconsistency & Generative In-context Lucidity), the first benchmark dataset and framework providing a fine-grained categorization of hallucinations in the multimodal image recontextualization task for large multimodal models (LMMs). While existing research often treats hallucinations as a uniform issue, our work addresses a significant gap in multimodal evaluation by decomposing these errors into five categories: pasted object hallucinations, background hallucinations, object omission, positional & logical inconsistencies, and physical law violations. To address these complexities, we propose a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our architecture processes recontextualized images through a series of specialized steps targeting object-level fidelity, background consistency, and omission detection, leveraging a coordinated ensemble of open-source models, whose effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations. Our approach enables a deeper understanding of where the models fail with an explanation; thus, we fill a gap in the field, as no prior methods offer such categorization and decomposition for this task. To promote transparency and further exploration, we openly release VIGIL, along with the detection pipeline and benchmark code, through our GitHub repository: https://github.com/mlubneuskaya/vigil and Data repository: https://huggingface.co/datasets/joannaww/VIGIL.

Motivation: 现有方法多使用边缘图（常被误称为草图），而真正处理含抽象性与形变的自由手绘草图的研究仍不足；且自由手绘草图本身不存在唯一正确的像素对齐真值，制约了监督训练。

Method: 提出一种基于调制的生成框架，强调对草图的语义理解而非边缘位置的严格匹配，并设计了一种新型损失函数，支持仅用自由手绘草图进行端到端训练。

Result: 在自由手绘草图的语义对齐能力、生成图像的逼真度及整体质量方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了自由手绘草图生成中语义保真与视觉真实性的权衡难题，为草图驱动的可控图像生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in generative AI, with natural language emerging as the most common conditioning input. As underlying models grow more powerful, researchers are exploring increasingly diverse conditioning signals, such as depth maps, edge maps, camera parameters, and reference images, to give users finer control over generation. Among different modalities, sketches are a natural and long-standing form of human communication, enabling rapid expression of visual concepts. Previous literature has largely focused on edge maps, often misnamed 'sketches', yet algorithms that effectively handle true freehand sketches, with their inherent abstraction and distortions, remain underexplored. We pursue the challenging goal of balancing photorealism with sketch adherence when generating images from freehand input. A key obstacle is the absence of ground-truth, pixel-aligned images: by their nature, freehand sketches do not have a single correct alignment. To address this, we propose a modulation-based approach that prioritizes semantic interpretation of the sketch over strict adherence to individual edge positions. We further introduce a novel loss that enables training on freehand sketches without requiring ground-truth pixel-aligned images. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches in both semantic alignment with freehand sketch inputs and in the realism and overall quality of the generated images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出首个通用图像免疫框架，通过生成单一的、适用于扩散模型编辑流程的通用对抗扰动（UAP），在不依赖训练数据的情况下有效阻止恶意语义编辑，兼具高实用性与跨模型迁移能力。

Motivation: 现有图像免疫方法依赖逐图优化的对抗扰动，扩展性差、不实用；而扩散模型编辑带来的深伪与版权风险亟需可规模化部署的防御方案。

Method: 受通用对抗扰动（UAP）攻击思想启发，设计一种面向扩散编辑流程的UAP生成方法：该扰动既嵌入指定语义目标，又抑制原图像内容，从而误导模型注意力、覆盖原始语义；支持数据无关（data-free）设置。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在UAP设定下显著优于多个基线；在受限扰动预算下性能媲美图像特异性方法，并具备强黑盒迁移性，可跨不同扩散模型泛化。

Conclusion: 所提通用图像免疫框架首次实现了对扩散模型编辑的有效、可扩展、数据无关且跨模型鲁棒的防御，为AI内容安全提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled powerful image editing capabilities guided by natural language prompts, unlocking new creative possibilities. However, they introduce significant ethical and legal risks, such as deepfakes and unauthorized use of copyrighted visual content. To address these risks, image immunization has emerged as a promising defense against AI-driven semantic manipulation. Yet, most existing approaches rely on image-specific adversarial perturbations that require individual optimization for each image, thereby limiting scalability and practicality. In this paper, we propose the first universal image immunization framework that generates a single, broadly applicable adversarial perturbation specifically designed for diffusion-based editing pipelines. Inspired by universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) techniques used in targeted attacks, our method generates a UAP that embeds a semantic target into images to be protected. Simultaneously, it suppresses original content to effectively misdirect the model's attention during editing. As a result, our approach effectively blocks malicious editing attempts by overwriting the original semantic content in the image via the UAP. Moreover, our method operates effectively even in data-free settings without requiring access to training data or domain knowledge, further enhancing its practicality and broad applicability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our method, as the first universal immunization approach, significantly outperforms several baselines in the UAP setting. In addition, despite the inherent difficulty of universal perturbations, our method also achieves performance on par with image-specific methods under a more restricted perturbation budget, while also exhibiting strong black-box transferability across different diffusion models.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了长期运动信息在视觉感知中的重要作用，发现其不仅有助于理解动作，还能更好地识别物体、材质和空间信息，并在低数据和零样本任务中表现出更强的泛化能力，同时具有计算效率高的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究长期运动信息在视觉感知中的作用及其特性，弥补当前对时间维度理解不足的空白。

Method: 利用点轨迹估计的最新进展来学习时间表征，并在多种感知任务上进行实验验证。

Result: 1) 长期运动表征能有效理解动作、物体、材质和空间信息，有时优于图像；2) 在低数据和零样本任务中泛化能力更强；3) 运动表征维度低、计算高效，与视频表征结合可提升性能。

Conclusion: 长期运动信息是视觉感知中极具潜力的信号源，未来模型应更充分地利用这一信息。

Abstract: Temporal information has long been considered to be essential for perception. While there is extensive research on the role of image information for perceptual tasks, the role of the temporal dimension remains less well understood: What can we learn about the world from long-term motion information? What properties does long-term motion information have for visual learning? We leverage recent success in point-track estimation, which offers an excellent opportunity to learn temporal representations and experiment on a variety of perceptual tasks. We draw 3 clear lessons: 1) Long-term motion representations contain information to understand actions, but also objects, materials, and spatial information, often even better than images. 2) Long-term motion representations generalize far better than image representations in low-data settings and in zero-shot tasks. 3) The very low dimensionality of motion information makes motion representations a better trade-off between GFLOPs and accuracy than standard video representations, and used together they achieve higher performance than video representations alone. We hope these insights will pave the way for the design of future models that leverage the power of long-term motion information for perception.

TL;DR: CAPA是一种参数高效的测试时优化框架，通过稀疏几何线索自适应预训练3D基础模型用于深度补全，冻结主干网络，仅微调少量参数，并在视频中引入序列级参数共享以提升一致性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖训练任务特定编码器处理辅助输入，易过拟合且泛化能力差；需更鲁棒、高效地利用稀疏观测来校正3D基础模型的几何先验。

Method: 提出CAPA框架：冻结3D基础模型主干，采用参数高效微调（如LoRA或VPT）仅更新少量参数；梯度直接由推理时的稀疏观测计算；对视频引入序列级参数共享以联合优化多帧。

Result: 在室内外多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，具有模型无关性，兼容任意ViT-based基础模型。

Conclusion: CAPA通过测试时轻量级自适应，有效将3D基础模型的通用几何先验与场景特定稀疏测量对齐，显著提升深度补全质量与鲁棒性，尤其适用于视频场景。

Abstract: We introduce CAPA, a parameter-efficient test-time optimization framework that adapts pre-trained 3D foundation models (FMs) for depth completion, using sparse geometric cues. Unlike prior methods that train task-specific encoders for auxiliary inputs, which often overfit and generalize poorly, CAPA freezes the FM backbone. Instead, it updates only a minimal set of parameters using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (e.g. LoRA or VPT), guided by gradients calculated directly from the sparse observations available at inference time. This approach effectively grounds the foundation model's geometric prior in the scene-specific measurements, correcting distortions and misplaced structures. For videos, CAPA introduces sequence-level parameter sharing, jointly adapting all frames to exploit temporal correlations, improve robustness, and enforce multi-frame consistency. CAPA is model-agnostic, compatible with any ViT-based FM, and achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse condition patterns on both indoor and outdoor datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAILS是一种无需训练的类增量语义分割框架，利用SAM进行零样本区域提取，并通过固定特征空间中的原型进行语义关联，避免了传统持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，且在多个标准数据集上超越了基于训练的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习受限于重复再训练、高计算成本和灾难性遗忘等问题，难以应用于实际场景。

Method: SAILS将类增量语义分割解耦为两个阶段：1）使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行零样本区域提取；2）在固定特征空间中通过选择性类内聚类生成多个类原型，实现语义关联。

Result: SAILS在无需任何增量训练的情况下，在标准CISS数据集（尤其是长而困难的任务序列）上性能通常超过现有基于训练的方法；完全消除遗忘，保持任务无关的一致性能；并表现出正向后向迁移（新类提升旧类性能）。

Conclusion: SAILS提供了一种高效、无遗忘、无需参数更新的CISS新范式，显著提升了持续学习在现实场景中的可行性与实用性。

Abstract: Continual learning remains constrained by the need for repeated retraining, high computational costs, and the persistent challenge of forgetting. These factors significantly limit the applicability of continuous learning in real-world settings, as iterative model updates require significant computational resources and inherently exacerbate forgetting. We present SAILS -- Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics, a training-free framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) that sidesteps these challenges entirely. SAILS leverages foundational models to decouple CISS into two stages: Zero-shot region extraction using Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by semantic association through prototypes in a fixed feature space. SAILS incorporates selective intra-class clustering, resulting in multiple prototypes per class to better model intra-class variability. Our results demonstrate that, despite requiring no incremental training, SAILS typically surpasses the performance of existing training-based approaches on standard CISS datasets, particularly in long and challenging task sequences where forgetting tends to be most severe. By avoiding parameter updates, SAILS completely eliminates forgetting and maintains consistent, task-invariant performance. Furthermore, SAILS exhibits positive backward transfer, where the introduction of new classes can enhance performance on previous classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用目标跟踪器在未见场景中泛化能力弱，且对遮挡的建模过于粗糙，缺乏细粒度感知能力。

Method: 提出GOT-JEPA：基于JEPA思想，将预测目标从图像特征扩展为跟踪模型本身，利用教师-学生结构在干净帧与受损帧间学习生成一致的伪跟踪模型；进一步提出OccuSolver：基于点跟踪器实现对象感知的可见性估计与遮挡模式精细建模，并通过迭代优化提升遮挡处理能力。

Result: 在七个基准上验证了方法在跟踪泛化性与鲁棒性上的显著提升。

Conclusion: GOT-JEPA与OccuSolver协同提升了通用跟踪器对复杂动态场景（特别是各类遮挡）的适应能力，为模型预测式预训练与细粒度遮挡感知提供了新范式。

Abstract: The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为视觉信息部分注意力（VIPA）的新框架，用于指代图像分割（RIS），通过构建‘视觉表达’并设计视觉表达生成器（VEG）模块，提升跨模态对齐与细粒度分割性能，并在四个公开基准上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽将视觉信息融入语言token，但难以有效利用视觉上下文进行细粒度分割；需降低高方差跨模态投影、增强语义一致性。

Method: 提出VIPA框架，核心是构建‘视觉表达’（即视觉中具信息量的部分），并设计视觉表达生成器（VEG）模块：通过局部-全局语言上下文线索检索视觉token，并对其进行去噪与属性共享以优化视觉表达。

Result: 在四个公开RIS基准上超越现有SOTA方法；可视化分析验证了模型注意力能稳健对齐细粒度目标区域。

Conclusion: VIPA通过引入结构化、语义丰富的视觉表达及VEG模块，显著提升了RIS任务中跨模态理解与定位精度，为细粒度视觉-语言对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment a target object described by a natural language expression. Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了在物体中心数据集上，常用眼动轨迹指标易受中心偏差影响，提出了一种去中心偏差的复合指标GCS，并发现了感知约束下的'外围甜点区'。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务驱动的硬注意力模型评估常依赖于眼动轨迹匹配度，但这些指标易受数据集中心偏差干扰，导致对模型行为对齐性的误判。

Method: 通过Gaze-CIFAR-10数据集分析中心偏差影响；系统扫描不同中央视野大小与外围上下文范围；提出去偏的Gaze Consistency Score（GCS）指标，融合去偏后的轨迹匹配与运动统计相似性。

Result: 发现仅在特定外围感知约束下，模型眼动轨迹才能同时超越中心基线且在时间动态上类人；GCS成功识别出中等视野尺寸下的鲁棒‘甜点区’及视野过大时的‘捷径区’。

Conclusion: 标准眼动轨迹指标在物体中心数据集上存在严重中心偏差，需采用如GCS等去偏指标来真实评估主动感知模型的行为对齐性；设计新基准应明确区分行为对齐与中心趋势。

Abstract: Human eye movements in visual recognition reflect a balance between foveal sampling and peripheral context. Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a "shortcut regime" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短时目标交互预判（STA）对可穿戴助手理解用户意图、提供及时辅助及人机交互至关重要，但现有方法在准确性和鲁棒性上仍有不足。

Method: 提出STAformer和STAformer++两种新型注意力架构，融合帧引导时间池化、图像-视频双模态注意力和多尺度特征；引入环境可操作性模型作为场景交互记忆，并采用自适应融合策略；同时基于手部与物体轨迹预测交互热点以提升局部预测置信度。

Abstract: Short Term object-interaction Anticipation consists in detecting the location of the next active objects, the noun and verb categories of the interaction, as well as the time to contact from the observation of egocentric video. This ability is fundamental for wearable assistants to understand user goals and provide timely assistance, or to enable human-robot interaction. In this work, we present a method to improve the performance of STA predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: 1 We propose STAformer and STAformer plus plus, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2 We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot. Our results show significant improvements on Overall Top-5 mAP, with gain up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on a novel set of curated EPIC-Kitchens STA labels. We released the code, annotations, and pre-extracted affordances on Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens to encourage future research in this area.

*Xiang Xiang Wang,Guo-Wei Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于单纯复形的多维持久层拉普拉斯（MPSL）框架，用于图像分析，通过融合多个降维维度下的拓扑谱特征，提升表示稳定性与分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常用降维方法（如PCA）对所选降维维度敏感，单一或平均维度选择效果有限，需利用多个维度的互补优势。

Method: 将图像样本建模为单纯复形，在各维度下计算持久层拉普拉斯以提取多尺度局部拓扑谱表示，并跨尺度与维度聚合统计摘要，形成多尺度多维图像表征。

Result: 在COIL20和ETH80数据集上验证，该方法在宽范围降维维度下性能更稳定，在中等维度区间持续优于PCA基线。

Conclusion: MPSL框架通过融合多维拓扑谱信息，提升了图像表示的鲁棒性与判别力，为降维敏感问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a multi-dimensional persistent sheaf Laplacian (MPSL) framework on simplicial complexes for image analysis. The proposed method is motivated by the strong sensitivity of commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to the choice of reduced dimension. Rather than selecting a single reduced dimension or averaging results across dimensions, we exploit complementary advantages of multiple reduced dimensions. At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations. We evaluate the proposed framework on the COIL20 and ETH80 image datasets using standard classification protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more stable performance across a wide range of reduced dimensions and achieves consistent improvements to PCA-based baselines in moderate dimensional regimes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) can automatically delineate lesions on computed tomography (CT) and generate radiology report content, yet progress is limited by the scarcity of publicly available CT datasets with lesion-level annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce CT-Bench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset comprising two components: a Lesion Image and Metadata Set containing 20,335 lesions from 7,795 CT studies with bounding boxes, descriptions, and size information, and a multitask visual question answering benchmark with 2,850 QA pairs covering lesion localization, description, size estimation, and attribute categorization. Hard negative examples are included to reflect real-world diagnostic challenges. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art multimodal models, including vision-language and medical CLIP variants, by comparing their performance to radiologist assessments, demonstrating the value of CT-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for lesion analysis. Moreover, fine-tuning models on the Lesion Image and Metadata Set yields significant performance gains across both components, underscoring the clinical utility of CT-Bench.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Wrivinder，一种零样本、几何驱动的框架，用于将地面图像与卫星地图对齐，并发布了MC-Sat数据集以支持该任务的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面图像与地理配准卫星地图对齐在制图、导航和态势感知中至关重要，但在大视角差异或GPS不可靠时仍具挑战性。

Method: Wrivinder结合了SfM重建、3D高斯泼溅、语义定位和单目深度度量线索，从多张地面照片重建一致的3D场景并生成稳定天顶视图渲染，以匹配卫星图像实现精确地理定位。

Result: 在零样本实验中，Wrivinder在密集和大范围场景中均实现了亚30米的地理定位精度。

Conclusion: Wrivinder和MC-Sat共同为无配对监督的几何中心跨视角对齐提供了首个综合基线和测试平台，验证了几何聚合方法在鲁棒地面-卫星定位中的潜力。

Abstract: Aligning ground-level imagery with geo-registered satellite maps is crucial for mapping, navigation, and situational awareness, yet remains challenging under large viewpoint gaps or when GPS is unreliable. We introduce Wrivinder, a zero-shot, geometry-driven framework that aggregates multiple ground photographs to reconstruct a consistent 3D scene and align it with overhead satellite imagery. Wrivinder combines SfM reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting, semantic grounding, and monocular depth--based metric cues to produce a stable zenith-view rendering that can be directly matched to satellite context for metrically accurate camera geo-localization. To support systematic evaluation of this task, which lacks suitable benchmarks, we also release MC-Sat, a curated dataset linking multi-view ground imagery with geo-registered satellite tiles across diverse outdoor environments. Together, Wrivinder and MC-Sat provide a first comprehensive baseline and testbed for studying geometry-centered cross-view alignment without paired supervision. In zero-shot experiments, Wrivinder achieves sub-30\,m geolocation accuracy across both dense and large-area scenes, highlighting the promise of geometry-based aggregation for robust ground-to-satellite localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出AnchorWeave框架，通过多个对齐良好的局部几何记忆替代易出错的全局3D重建记忆，并设计多锚点编织控制器与覆盖驱动的检索机制，显著提升长时序相机可控视频生成的空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于全局3D场景重建的记忆方法因多视角位姿与深度估计误差导致跨视角几何不一致，融合后噪声污染条件信号，损害生成质量。

Method: AnchorWeave构建多个干净的局部几何记忆，采用覆盖驱动的局部记忆检索策略，并在生成过程中通过多锚点编织控制器融合多个局部记忆进行条件控制。

Result: 在长时序相机可控视频生成任务中，AnchorWeave显著提升了空间世界一致性，同时保持高视觉质量；消融实验验证了局部几何条件、多锚点控制和覆盖驱动检索的有效性。

Conclusion: 用多个对齐良好的局部几何记忆替代单一全局记忆，并智能融合，是提升长时序视频空间一致性的有效范式。

Abstract: Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.

*Ayush Shrivastava,Kirtan Gangani,Laksh Jain,Mayank Goel,Nipun Batra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ThermEval-B，一个用于评估视觉语言模型在热成像理解能力的新型基准测试，发现现有模型在温度感知推理等方面表现不佳，强调了热成像理解需要专门的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像在夜间监控、搜救、自动驾驶和医疗筛查等低可见光场景中至关重要，但现有以RGB为中心的视觉语言模型（VLMs）无法泛化到热图像，且缺乏针对热图像特性的评估基准。

Method: 构建了包含约55,000个热图像视觉问答对的结构化基准ThermEval-B，整合公开数据集与新采集的ThermEval-D（首个提供密集像素级温度图与语义身体部位标注的数据集），并对25个开源和闭源VLM进行系统评估。

Result: 模型普遍在温度相关推理上失败，对色彩映射变换敏感，易依赖语言先验或固定回答；提示工程和监督微调仅带来微弱提升。

Conclusion: 热成像理解不能依赖RGB中心假设，需专用评估基准；ThermEval-B为推动热视觉语言建模研究提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on RGB imagery, but they do not generalize to thermal images. Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.

*Kaiyu Yue,Menglin Jia,Ji Hou,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sphere Encoder是一种高效的单步生成框架，通过将图像映射到球面潜在空间并随机采样解码生成图像，在极少数步骤（<5）内达到与多步扩散模型相当的质量，同时大幅降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型推理步骤多、计算成本高的问题，寻求高效、高质量的单步或少步图像生成方法。

Method: 设计一个编码器将自然图像均匀映射到球面潜在空间，再用解码器将球面上的随机点映射回图像空间；仅使用图像重建损失进行训练；支持条件生成，并可通过少量编码-解码循环提升质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上性能媲美先进扩散模型，但推理成本仅为后者的极小部分（<5步）。

Conclusion: Sphere Encoder证明了简单、单向、基于球面先验的生成范式可在极低计算开销下实现高质量图像生成，为高效生成建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce the Sphere Encoder, an efficient generative framework capable of producing images in a single forward pass and competing with many-step diffusion models using fewer than five steps. Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出EditCtrl，一种高效的视频编辑控制框架，通过局部视频上下文模块和轻量级时间全局上下文嵌入器，在保证高质量编辑的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练视频基础模型的高保真生成式视频编辑方法计算开销大，尤其在仅需稀疏、局部编辑时仍处理完整视频上下文，效率低下。

Method: 提出EditCtrl框架：1）局部视频上下文模块，仅处理掩码区域对应的token，使计算量与编辑区域大小成正比；2）轻量级时间全局上下文嵌入器，以低开销保障全视频时序一致性。

Result: EditCtrl比当前最优生成式编辑方法计算效率提升10倍，且编辑质量反超全注意力方法；支持多区域文本驱动编辑与自回归内容传播等新能力。

Conclusion: EditCtrl通过‘局部优先+全局引导’的设计范式，实现了高效性与高质量的统一，为实用化视频编辑提供了新路径。

Abstract: High-fidelity generative video editing has seen significant quality improvements by leveraging pre-trained video foundation models. However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.

*Ligong Lei,Wenwen Lu,Xudong Pang,Zaokere Kadeer,Aishan Wumaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态一致性引导、无参考的数据选择方法，用于自动语音识别（ASR）系统在无标签条件下的口音自适应，显著提升了伪标签选择的可靠性与下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR系统在带口音语音上性能下降，而依赖文本中心启发式（如困惑度过滤）的伪标签选择易选中声学不匹配但流利的错误假设，导致微调时误差放大。

Method: 提出一种无参考、多模态一致性引导的数据选择流程：首先基于子模互信息进行目标感知预筛选；再通过扰动解码生成每条语音的多个伪转录，并利用共享嵌入空间中的语音-文本对齐程度和预测词错误率（WER）两个无参考信号评分；最后用百分位阈值规则筛选高置信伪标签。

Result: 在领域内设置下，从3万样本中选出约1.5k样本即可达到10.91% WER，接近使用全部3万监督标签的10.45%；跨域设置下该方法避免了未过滤伪标签带来的性能退化，且在更强ASR主干网络上优于随机采样及近期基线。

Conclusion: 多模态一致性评估可有效提升无监督口音自适应中伪标签的质量与鲁棒性，为低资源口音适配提供高效可行的新范式。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often degrade on accented speech because acoustic-phonetic and prosodic shifts induce a mismatch to training data, making labeled accent adaptation costly. However, common pseudo-label selection heuristics are largely text-centric (e.g., perplexity (PPL) filtering) and can prefer fluent yet acoustically mismatched hypotheses, leading to error amplification when fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a multimodal consistency-guided, reference-free data selection pipeline for ASR accent adaptation under a transductive, label-free protocol. The pipeline starts with a target-aware preselection step based on submodular mutual information to improve query relevance and reduce downstream computation. It then generates multiple pseudo-transcriptions per utterance via perturbation-based decoding and scores each hypothesis using two reference-free signals: speech--text alignment in a shared embedding space and predicted word error rate (WER). A simple percentile-based selection rule retains reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning while discarding noisy utterances. In an in-domain setting, selecting ~1.5k utterances from a 30k pool achieves 10.91% WER, close to 10.45% obtained using 30k supervised labels. In a cross-domain setting with a mismatched candidate pool, consistency-filtered subsets avoid the degradation caused by unfiltered pseudo-labels under strong accent shift, and matched-hour experiments on a stronger ASR backbone further confirm gains over random sampling and recent selection baselines.

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）和机器翻译系统在危机场景多语翻译中的表现，特别关注‘紧迫性’这一关键语义属性的保持能力；研究发现现有模型在紧迫性传达上存在显著退化与不稳定性，提示其在高风险危机通信中存在重大部署风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽被广泛提议用于危机应对中的多语沟通，但其在高风险危机场景下的适用性尚缺乏充分评估，尤其是对危机通信中至关重要的‘紧迫性’语义属性的保持能力。

Method: 构建了一个覆盖32种以上语言、含紧迫性标注的新危机领域多语数据集，系统评测当前先进LLMs与专用机器翻译模型在危机翻译任务中对紧迫性的保真度，并分析提示语言与输入语言对LLM紧迫性判断的影响。

Result: LLMs和专用翻译模型均在危机翻译任务中表现出显著性能下降与不稳定性；即使语法正确的翻译也常扭曲原文紧迫性感知；LLM对紧迫性的分类结果高度依赖提示与输入的语言，波动剧烈。

Conclusion: 通用语言技术直接用于危机通信存在严重风险，亟需建立面向危机场景的专用评估框架与紧迫性感知建模方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for crisis preparedness and response, particularly for multilingual communication. However, their suitability for high-stakes crisis contexts remains insufficiently evaluated. This work examines the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and machine translation systems in crisis-domain translation, with a focus on preserving urgency, which is a critical property for effective crisis communication and triaging. Using multilingual crisis data and a newly introduced urgency-annotated dataset covering over 32 languages, we show that both dedicated translation models and LLMs exhibit substantial performance degradation and instability. Crucially, even linguistically adequate translations can distort perceived urgency, and LLM-based urgency classifications vary widely depending on the language of the prompt and input. These findings highlight significant risks in deploying general-purpose language technologies for crisis communication and underscore the need for crisis-aware evaluation frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数字技术的发展，网络欺凌和在线虐待风险上升，尤其需要加强对儿童的保护；而斯瓦希里语作为非洲使用最广泛的语言之一，却缺乏足够的语言资源和技术支持，因此亟需针对该语言开发有效的检测方法。

Method: 采用支持向量机（SVM）、逻辑回归和决策树等机器学习模型，并结合参数调优与SMOTE技术处理数据不平衡问题，对斯瓦希里语中的隐晦滥用语言进行检测分析。

Result: 模型在高维文本数据上表现良好，但由于数据集规模小且存在类别不平衡，结果泛化能力受限；精确率、召回率和F1分数分析揭示了各模型在隐晦语言检测中的细微差异。

Conclusion: 本研究为构建更安全的儿童网络环境提供了初步探索，强调需扩大数据集、改进机器学习技术，并建议未来工作聚焦于增强数据鲁棒性、探索迁移学习及融合多模态数据，以建立更具文化敏感性的检测机制。

Abstract: The rise of digital technology has dramatically increased the potential for cyberbullying and online abuse, necessitating enhanced measures for detection and prevention, especially among children. This study focuses on detecting abusive obfuscated language in Swahili, a low-resource language that poses unique challenges due to its limited linguistic resources and technological support. Swahili is chosen due to its popularity and being the most widely spoken language in Africa, with over 16 million native speakers and upwards of 100 million speakers in total, spanning regions in East Africa and some parts of the Middle East.
  We employed machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, optimized through rigorous parameter tuning and techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle data imbalance. Our analysis revealed that, while these models perform well in high-dimensional textual data, our dataset's small size and imbalance limit our findings' generalizability. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were thoroughly analyzed, highlighting the nuanced performance of each model in detecting obfuscated language.
  This research contributes to the broader discourse on ensuring safer online environments for children, advocating for expanded datasets and advanced machine-learning techniques to improve the effectiveness of cyberbullying detection systems. Future work will focus on enhancing data robustness, exploring transfer learning, and integrating multimodal data to create more comprehensive and culturally sensitive detection mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了机器学习模型（尤其是语言模型和自编码器）在隐藏层嵌入中存储输入信息（即'记忆'）的能力，发现语言模型嵌入信息贫乏，而自编码器可实现近乎完美的记忆；据此提出一种并行化编码器-解码器记忆模型架构，并通过联合优化因果预测与信息保留目标、以及分阶段课程训练策略，显著提升记忆能力与计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型虽广泛使用嵌入作为‘记忆’，但其信息存储能力缺乏系统刻画；同时，单纯依赖下一词预测目标难以支持准确、可逆的记忆形成，亟需新视角与新架构来提升嵌入的信息保真度与可访问性。

Method: 对比分析语言模型与自编码器嵌入的信息容量；提出并实现一种并行化编码器-解码器记忆模型；采用因果训练与信息保留目标的联合优化；引入冻结高保真编码器 + 两阶段课程训练（先学解码记忆、再学预测token）策略。

Result: 自编码器嵌入可近乎完美重建输入，远超语言模型嵌入的信息量；所提记忆模型在联合目标下能形成信息丰富的可解码记忆；课程训练显著提升训练效率与记忆性能；理论指出下一词预测目标本质不可逆，限制记忆能力。

Conclusion: 下一词预测范式本身不利于高保真记忆形成；应结合信息保留目标与结构化训练策略，发展以记忆效能为导向的新一代序列建模架构。

Abstract: The ability of machine learning models to store input information in hidden layer vector embeddings, analogous to the concept of `memory', is widely employed but not well characterized. We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed.

*Ozancan Ozdemir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study develops a Turkish-specific BERT model to empirically detect AI-rewritten news content, achieving high accuracy and estimating ~2.5% of sampled Turkish news articles were LLM-revised.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no empirical investigation into the prevalence of AI-generated content in Turkish news media, unlike English-language outlets; existing Turkish research is limited to qualitative interviews or fake news detection.

Method: Fine-tuned a Turkish BERT model (dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles from three major Turkish outlets for binary classification of AI-rewritten content.

Result: The model achieved 0.9708 F1 score with symmetric precision/recall; applied to 3,500+ unseen articles (2023–2026), it showed stable performance, mean confidence >0.96, and estimated ~2.5% of content was LLM-revised.

Conclusion: This is the first data-driven, empirical measurement of AI usage in Turkish news media—moving beyond journalist self-reports—and provides a scalable method for monitoring AI integration in non-English journalistic ecosystems.

Abstract: The rapid integration of large language models into newsroom workflows has raised urgent questions about the prevalence of AI-generated content in online media. While computational studies have begun to quantify this phenomenon in English-language outlets, no empirical investigation exists for Turkish news media, where existing research remains limited to qualitative interviews with journalists or fake news detection. This study addresses that gap by fine-tuning a Turkish-specific BERT model (dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles from three major Turkish outlets with distinct editorial orientations for binary classification of AI-rewritten content. The model achieves 0.9708 F1 score on the held-out test set with symmetric precision and recall across both classes. Subsequent deployment on over 3,500 unseen articles spanning between 2023 and 2026 reveals consistent cross-source and temporally stable classification patterns, with mean prediction confidence exceeding 0.96 and an estimated 2.5 percentage of examined news content rewritten or revised by LLMs on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to move beyond self-reported journalist perceptions toward empirical, data-driven measurement of AI usage in Turkish news media.

### [165] [Think Deep, Not Just Long: Measuring LLM Reasoning Effort via Deep-Thinking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13517)
*Wei-Lin Chen,Liqian Peng,Tian Tan,Chao Zhao,Blake JianHang Chen,Ziqian Lin,Alec Go,Yu Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于‘深度思考token’的新指标——deep-thinking ratio，用于更准确地衡量大模型推理时的计算努力程度，并据此设计了高效的测试时缩放策略Think@n，在保持甚至提升准确率的同时显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现单纯增加生成长度（即token数）并不能稳定提升推理准确率，反而可能导致'过度思考'和性能下降；因此需要一个更可靠的推理质量代理指标。

Method: 定义并识别'深度思考token'（即在深层模型中预测发生显著修正的token），计算其在生成序列中的比例（deep-thinking ratio）；在此基础上提出Think@n策略，通过前缀评估并早期拒绝低deep-thinking ratio的样本以实现高效测试时缩放。

Result: deep-thinking ratio在多个数学与科学基准（AIME、HMMT、GPQA-diamond）及多种推理模型（GPT-OSS、DeepSeek-R1、Qwen3）上均与准确率呈稳健正相关，显著优于长度和置信度基线；Think@n策略在匹配或超越标准self-consistency性能的同时大幅降低推理开销。

Conclusion: deep-thinking ratio是一种比生成长度更优的推理质量代理指标；Think@n为高效、可扩展的测试时推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities by scaling test-time compute via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, recent findings suggest that raw token counts are unreliable proxies for reasoning quality: increased generation length does not consistently correlate with accuracy and may instead signal "overthinking," leading to performance degradation. In this work, we quantify inference-time effort by identifying deep-thinking tokens -- tokens where internal predictions undergo significant revisions in deeper model layers prior to convergence. Across four challenging mathematical and scientific benchmarks (AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, and GPQA-diamond) and a diverse set of reasoning-focused models (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3), we show that deep-thinking ratio (the proportion of deep-thinking tokens in a generated sequence) exhibits a robust and consistently positive correlation with accuracy, substantially outperforming both length-based and confidence-based baselines. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Think@n, a test-time scaling strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios. We demonstrate that Think@n matches or exceeds standard self-consistency performance while significantly reducing inference costs by enabling the early rejection of unpromising generations based on short prefixes.

### [166] [On Calibration of Large Language Models: From Response To Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13540)
*Sin-Han Yang,Cheng-Kuang Wu,Chieh-Yen Lin,Yun-Nung Chen,Hung-yi Lee,Shao-Hua Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出能力校准（capability calibration）概念，旨在估计大语言模型对某个查询的整体解决概率，而非单次响应的正确性；通过理论分析与实证研究，证明其优于传统响应级校准，并在pass@$k$预测和推理资源分配中展现优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM校准方法聚焦于单次响应的正确性（response-level confidence），但实际应用中更关心模型解决某查询的整体能力，而单次响应受解码随机性影响，无法准确反映模型真实能力。

Method: 提出能力校准定义，即模型在给定查询上多次采样下的期望准确率；形式化区分能力校准与响应校准；构建实证评估框架，对比多种置信度估计方法。

Result: 能力校准能更准确预测pass@$k$指标，并优化推理预算分配；理论与实验均表明其显著优于响应校准。

Conclusion: 能力校准是更符合实际需求的LLM可信度评估范式，为提升LLM可靠性提供了新基础与应用方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as general-purpose problem solvers, making accurate confidence estimation critical for reliable use. Prior work on LLM calibration largely focuses on response-level confidence, which estimates the correctness of a single generated output. However, this formulation is misaligned with many practical settings where the central question is how likely a model is to solve a query overall. We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability. To address this issue, we introduce capability calibration, which targets the model's expected accuracy on a query. We formally distinguish capability calibration from response calibration and show that the two differ both theoretically and empirically. We establish an empirical evaluation setup and study a range of confidence estimation methods. Our results demonstrate that capability-calibrated confidence improves pass@$k$ prediction and inference budget allocation, establishing a foundation with potential for diverse applications.

*Yike Wang,Faeze Brahman,Shangbin Feng,Teng Xiao,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出FLIP方法，通过反向推理重构指令并计算其与原始指令的相似度作为奖励信号，实现无需参考答案和评分标准的奖励建模，在多个任务上显著优于LLM-as-a-Judge基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励建模方法依赖大模型强推理能力（LLM-as-a-Judge）或需参考响应/显式评分标准，限制了灵活性与可及性，尤其在非可验证领域。

Method: 提出FLIP（FLipped Inference for Prompt reconstruction），采用参考-free、rubric-free的反向推理范式：给定响应，推断最可能生成该响应的指令，并以推断指令与原始指令的相似度作为奖励信号。

Result: 在四个领域、13个小语言模型上的实验表明，FLIP平均超越LLM-as-a-Judge基线79.6%；在测试时扩展（并行采样、GRPO训练）的外在评估中显著提升下游性能；对长输出更有效，且对常见奖励作弊鲁棒。

Conclusion: FLIP通过显式利用‘验证-生成’差距，实现了在小模型规模下可靠、可扩展的奖励建模，弥补了传统判断式方法在降尺度场景下的失效问题。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a central role throughout the language model (LM) pipeline, particularly in non-verifiable domains. However, the dominant LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm relies on the strong reasoning capabilities of large models, while alternative approaches require reference responses or explicit rubrics, limiting flexibility and broader accessibility. In this work, we propose FLIP (FLipped Inference for Prompt reconstruction), a reference-free and rubric-free reward modeling approach that reformulates reward modeling through backward inference: inferring the instruction that would most plausibly produce a given response. The similarity between the inferred and the original instructions is then used as the reward signal. Evaluations across four domains using 13 small language models show that FLIP outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge baselines by an average of 79.6%. Moreover, FLIP substantially improves downstream performance in extrinsic evaluations under test-time scaling via parallel sampling and GRPO training. We further find that FLIP is particularly effective for longer outputs and robust to common forms of reward hacking. By explicitly exploiting the validation-generation gap, FLIP enables reliable reward modeling in downscaled regimes where judgment methods fail. Code available at https://github.com/yikee/FLIP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DistillLens框架，通过Logit Lens将中间隐藏状态投影到词汇空间，并采用对称散度目标实现师生模型思维过程的结构对齐，从而提升知识蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准知识蒸馏忽略教师模型中间层的不确定性信息，现有特征蒸馏方法（如MSE、非对称KL）未能有效建模思维过程中的丰富不确定性。

Method: 提出DistillLens框架：利用Logit Lens将师生模型中间隐藏状态映射至词汇空间，并施加对称散度约束以实现思维过程的结构对齐。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama架构上实验表明，DistillLens在多个指令遵循基准上持续优于标准知识蒸馏和特征迁移基线方法。

Conclusion: 对称地对齐师生模型的中间思维过程（而非仅输出）可更有效地保留高熵推理路径，提升学生模型性能。

Abstract: Standard Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing final outputs, yet it typically treats the teacher's intermediate layer's thought process as a black box. While feature-based distillation attempts to bridge this gap, existing methods (e.g., MSE and asymmetric KL divergence) ignore the rich uncertainty profiles required for the final output. In this paper, we introduce DistillLens, a framework that symmetrically aligns the evolving thought processes of student and teacher models. By projecting intermediate hidden states into the vocabulary space via the Logit Lens, we enforce structural alignment using a symmetric divergence objective. Our analysis proves that this constraint imposes a dual-sided penalty, preventing both overconfidence and underconfidence while preserving the high-entropy information conduits essential for final deduction. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and Llama architectures demonstrate that DistillLens consistently outperforms standard KD and feature-transfer baselines on diverse instruction-following benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练、即插即用的LLM-Confidence Reranker（LCR）方法，利用大语言模型（LLM）内在的语义置信度（通过MSCP量化）改进RAG系统中的文档重排序，显著提升检索效果且不增加计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG重排序器依赖专门训练、计算开销大，且未充分利用LLM固有的置信度信号，难以有效缓解知识密集型任务中的幻觉问题。

Method: LCR是一种无训练、黑盒式重排序算法：首先通过多项式采样与语义聚类评估LLM对查询-文档对的置信度（MSCP），再基于查询和文档置信阈值进行分箱与多级排序，兼顾高置信查询的原始排序鲁棒性。

Result: 在BEIR和TREC基准上，使用7–9B参数预训练LLM，LCR使NDCG@5最高提升20.6%，性能超越预训练LLM与微调Transformer重排序器，且无性能退化；消融实验验证LLM置信度与文档相关性正相关。

Conclusion: LCR以低计算成本、高并行性与强兼容性，有效增强RAG检索质量，为缓解医疗诊断等关键场景中的幻觉问题提供了实用新路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks remain a critical challenge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism. LCR offers computational efficiency, parallelism for scalability, and broad compatibility, mitigating hallucinations in applications like medical diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Elo-Evolve框架，通过多智能体动态对抗与Elo驱动的对手选择，替代传统静态奖励建模，显著提升LLM对齐的鲁棒性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法依赖静态绝对奖励函数，存在数据稀缺、噪声敏感和训练不稳定等问题。

Method: 提出Elo-Evolve共进化框架：（1）直接从二元胜负结果学习，摒弃Bradley-Terry模型；（2）基于Elo评分的温度控制对手采样，实现自动课程学习；理论基础为PAC学习，强调成对比较的样本效率优势。

Result: 在Alpaca Eval 2.0和MT-Bench上验证，Elo-Evolve显著优于点式打分法和静态成对训练；实测噪声降低4.5倍；Qwen2.5-7B模型在多尺度对手（Qwen2.5-14B/32B、Qwen3-8B）竞争中展现出清晰性能层级。

Conclusion: 成对比较结合动态对手选择是更鲁棒、高效、可扩展的LLM对齐范式，Elo-Evolve为对齐提供了新理论视角与实用框架。

Abstract: Current alignment methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on compressing vast amounts of human preference data into static, absolute reward functions, leading to data scarcity, noise sensitivity, and training instability. We introduce Elo-Evolve, a co-evolutionary framework that redefines alignment as dynamic multi-agent competition within an adaptive opponent pool. Our approach makes two key innovations: (1) eliminating Bradley-Terry model dependencies by learning directly from binary win/loss outcomes in pairwise competitions, and (2) implementing Elo-orchestrated opponent selection that provides automatic curriculum learning through temperature-controlled sampling. We ground our approach in PAC learning theory, demonstrating that pairwise comparison achieves superior sample complexity and empirically validate a 4.5x noise reduction compared to absolute scoring approaches. Experimentally, we train a Qwen2.5-7B model using our framework with opponents including Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Qwen3-8B models. Results demonstrate a clear performance hierarchy: point-based methods < static pairwise training < Elo-Evolve across Alpaca Eval 2.0 and MT-Bench, validating the progressive benefits of pairwise comparison and dynamic opponent selection for LLM alignment.

*Veronica Mangiaterra,Chiara Barattieri di San Pietro,Paolo Canal,Valentina Bambini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究利用历时分布语义学方法，分析19世纪与21世纪意大利语料中文学隐喻的语义相似性变化，发现隐喻加工难度总体稳定，但受体裁和词汇语义特征显著调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文学隐喻在实验研究中相对不足，且既有心理语言学与计算语言学研究忽视其历时维度；需考察不同时代、不同语境下隐喻理解的动态变化。

Method: 基于19世纪与21世纪意大利文学与非文学语料（共1.24亿词符）训练词向量，计算515个19世纪文学隐喻中‘话题’与‘载体’间的语义相似性，作为加工难度指标，并分析体裁与词汇语义特征（如向量一致性、语义邻域密度）的调节作用。

Result: 隐喻整体加工难度（语义相似性）跨世纪保持稳定；但体裁效应显著：现代文学中隐喻更难（相似性更低），而当代网络语言中更易（相似性更高）；该模式受词汇语义特征调节。

Conclusion: 文学隐喻的理解并非静态，而是随语言演化（如现代文学风格简化、网络语言高创造性）与语境变迁动态调整；历时分布语义学可有效建模隐喻认知的历史维度。

Abstract: Metaphors are a distinctive feature of literary language, yet they remain less studied experimentally than everyday metaphors. Moreover, previous psycholinguistic and computational approaches overlooked the temporal dimension, although many literary metaphors were coined centuries apart from contemporary readers. This study innovatively applies tools from diachronic distributional semantics to assess whether the processing costs of literary metaphors varied over time and genre. Specifically, we trained word embeddings on literary and nonliterary Italian corpora from the 19th and 21st centuries, for a total of 124 million tokens, and modeled changes in the semantic similarity between topics and vehicles of 515 19th-century literary metaphors, taking this measure as a proxy of metaphor processing demands. Overall, semantic similarity, and hence metaphor processing demands, remained stable over time. However, genre played a key role: metaphors appeared more difficult (i.e., lower topic-vehicle similarity) in modern literary contexts than in 19th-century literature, but easier (i.e., higher topic-vehicle similarity) in today's nonliterary language (e.g., the Web) than in 19th-century nonliterary texts. This pattern was further shaped by semantic features of metaphors' individual terms, such as vector coherence and semantic neighborhood density. Collectively, these findings align with broader linguistic changes in Italian, such as the stylistic simplification of modern literature, which may have increased metaphor processing demands, and the high creativity of the Web's language, which seems to render metaphor more accessible.

Abstract: Identifying the strategic uses of reformulation in discourse remains a key challenge for computational argumentation. While LLMs can detect surface-level similarity, they often fail to capture the pragmatic functions of rephrasing, such as its role within rhetorical discourse. This paper presents a comparative multi-agent framework designed to quantify the benefits of incorporating explicit theoretical knowledge for this task. We utilise an dataset of annotated political debates to establish a new standard encompassing four distinct rephrase functions: Deintensification, Intensification, Specification, Generalisation, and Other, which covers all remaining types (D-I-S-G-O). We then evaluate two parallel LLM-based agent systems: one enhanced by argumentation theory via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and an identical zero-shot baseline. The results reveal a clear performance gap: the RAG-enhanced agents substantially outperform the baseline across the board, with particularly strong advantages in detecting Intensification and Generalisation context, yielding an overall Macro F1-score improvement of nearly 30\%. Our findings provide evidence that theoretical grounding is not only beneficial but essential for advancing beyond mere paraphrase detection towards function-aware analysis of argumentative discourse. This comparative multi-agent architecture represents a step towards scalable, theoretically informed computational tools capable of identifying rhetorical strategies in contemporary discourse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEE方法受限于标注数据稀缺（仅M2E2提供评测标注）、缺乏显式结构化事件表征学习能力，且跨模态论元定位效果弱。

Method: 提出RMPL：一种关系感知的多任务渐进学习框架，分阶段利用单模态事件抽取和多媒体关系抽取的异构监督信号，先统一模式学习跨模态事件中心表征，再联合图文数据微调事件提及识别与论元角色抽取。

Result: 在M2E2基准上，结合多种视觉-语言模型（VLMs）实验表明，RMPL在不同模态设置下均取得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: RMPL有效缓解了MEE任务中的低资源瓶颈，通过渐进式多任务学习增强了跨模态语义对齐与结构化事件建模能力。

Abstract: Multimedia Event Extraction (MEE) aims to identify events and their arguments from documents that contain both text and images. It requires grounding event semantics across different modalities. Progress in MEE is limited by the lack of annotated training data. M2E2 is the only established benchmark, but it provides annotations only for evaluation. This makes direct supervised training impractical. Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities. It is then fine-tuned for event mention identification and argument role extraction using mixed textual and visual data. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark with multiple VLMs show consistent improvements across different modality settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于用法的跨模态词义-手语对应分析方法，构建了首个德语/德语手语（DGS）词义到手语ID的手动标注数据集，并评估了精确匹配与语义相似度两种计算方法在识别不同对应类型（如一词多义、多词一义等）上的性能，发现语义相似度方法显著更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语词典常忽略多义词和同音词在不同语境下对应不同手语的现象，导致词-手语映射不完整；需通过用法驱动的方法挖掘未被收录的新映射，以丰富词典资源。

Method: 基于德语词用图（D-WUG）和德语手语数字词典（DW-DGS），人工标注32个德语词在上下文中的1404个词用-手语ID映射；定义四种对应类型（Type 1/2/3及No Match）；采用Exact Match和基于SBERT的Semantic Similarity两种计算方法进行评估。

Result: Semantic Similarity方法总体准确率达88.52%，显著优于Exact Match的71.31%；尤其在Type 1（一词多义）上提升达52.1个百分点；首次发布跨模态词义-手语对应标注数据集及代码。

Conclusion: 语义相似度方法更适合建模词义与手语之间的复杂对应关系；该工作为手语词典编纂和跨模态NLP提供了新数据、新方法与实证依据。

Abstract: Sign language lexicographers construct bilingual dictionaries by establishing word-to-sign mappings, where polysemous and homonymous words corresponding to different signs across contexts are often underrepresented. A usage-based approach examining how word senses map to signs can identify such novel mappings absent from current dictionaries, enriching lexicographic resources. We address this by analyzing German and German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebärdensprache, DGS), manually annotating 1,404 word use-to-sign ID mappings derived from 32 words from the German Word Usage Graph (D-WUG) and 49 signs from the Digital Dictionary of German Sign Language (DW-DGS). We identify three correspondence types: Type 1 (one-to-many), Type 2 (many-to-one), and Type 3 (one-to-one), plus No Match cases. We evaluate computational methods: Exact Match (EM) and Semantic Similarity (SS) using SBERT embeddings. SS substantially outperforms EM overall 88.52% vs. 71.31%), with dramatic gains for Type 1 (+52.1 pp). Our work establishes the first annotated dataset for cross-modal sense correspondence and reveals which correspondence patterns are computationally identifiable. Our code and dataset are made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球多数患者，尤其在资源受限地区，难以获得及时、高质量的多学科肿瘤会诊（MDT）服务，亟需可扩展、可解释的AI辅助决策工具。

Method: 构建OMGs——一个由领域特异性智能体协同工作的多智能体AI系统，整合多学科证据并生成类MDT推荐及透明推理；设计SPEAR五维评估框架（安全性、个体化、证据性、可操作性、鲁棒性），并在多中心回顾与前瞻性研究中验证。

Result: OMGs在多中心回顾评估中得分（4.45±0.30）接近专家MDT（4.53±0.23），证据性维度显著更高（4.57 vs 3.92）；前瞻性研究（59例）显示其与常规MDT决策高度一致；人机配对研究证实OMGs显著提升临床医生在证据性和鲁棒性维度的决策质量。

Conclusion: 多智能体协商式AI系统可在性能和可解释性上媲美专家MDT共识，有望弥补资源匮乏地区专科肿瘤诊疗能力缺口。

Abstract: Ovarian tumour management has increasingly relied on multidisciplinary tumour board (MDT) deliberation to address treatment complexity and disease heterogeneity. However, most patients worldwide lack access to timely expert consensus, particularly in resource-constrained centres where MDT resources are scarce or unavailable. Here we present OMGs (Ovarian tumour Multidisciplinary intelligent aGent System), a multi-agent AI framework where domain-specific agents deliberate collaboratively to integrate multidisciplinary evidence and generate MDT-style recommendations with transparent rationales. To systematically evaluate MDT recommendation quality, we developed SPEAR (Safety, Personalization, Evidence, Actionability, Robustness) and validated OMGs across diverse clinical scenarios spanning the care continuum. In multicentre re-evaluation, OMGs achieved performance comparable to expert MDT consensus ($4.45 \pm 0.30$ versus $4.53 \pm 0.23$), with higher Evidence scores (4.57 versus 3.92). In prospective multicentre evaluation (59 patients), OMGs demonstrated high concordance with routine MDT decisions. Critically, in paired human-AI studies, OMGs most substantially enhanced clinicians' recommendations in Evidence and Robustness, the dimensions most compromised when multidisciplinary expertise is unavailable. These findings suggest that multi-agent deliberative systems can achieve performance comparable to expert MDT consensus, with potential to expand access to specialized oncology expertise in resource-limited settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究也门英语学习者在习得英语不规则屈折形态过程中，第一语言迁移与第二语言发展因素如何交互作用，以及普遍语法在成人二语习得中是否持续可及。

Method: 采用两阶段纵向设计，结合错误分析与统计方法（如单因素方差分析），检验学习者在不规则屈折形态产出上的发展变化，并依据特征重组假说（FRH）解释其内在机制。

Result: 结果显示：第一阶段以L1迁移为主导；第二阶段学习者对UG属性更敏感，不规则屈折产出显著提升；但辅音变化、零形貌素及-a复数形式仍存在持续困难，表明UG访问受限于输入质量与教学效果。

Conclusion: L1迁移和L2发展因素共同影响初期习得，但高质量的语言输入与教学是促成UG驱动下特征重组的关键条件。

Abstract: This study examines the acquisition of English irregular inflections by Yemeni learners of English as a second language (L2), utilizing a Universal Grammar (UG) approach. Within the UG approach, the study considers Feature Reassembly Hypothesis (FRH) (Lardiere, 2008, 2009) part of UG, focusing on the roles of first language (L1) transfer and L2 developmental influence. It analyzes learner errors across two developmental stages. Stage 1 data reveal a dominant influence of L1 transfer, particularly in phonological and structural mismatches, while stage 2 data demonstrate increased learner sensitivity to UG properties and morphological reconfiguration toward the target language. Findings reveal that errors in irregular inflectional morphology are attributed to both interlingual and intralingual sources, with overgeneralization of L2 rules as a common developmental strategy. Statistical analysis, including a one-way ANOVA, indicates significant improvement in the production of well-formed irregular inflections from stage 1 to stage 2, underscoring learners' continued access to UG. However, persistent difficulties with consonant change, zero-morpheme, and -a plural inflections suggest that limited exposure, ineffective input modeling, and insufficient instructional quality constrain full UG access. The study concludes that while L1 transfer and L2 developmental factors influence initial stages of acquisition, appropriate linguistic input and instruction are critical for facilitating UG-driven feature reassembly in adult L2 learners.

*Minyuan Ruan,Ziyue Wang,Kaiming Liu,Yunghwei Lai,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向大语言模型（LLMs）的实用化心智理论（ToM）框架，强调其在检测与弥合用户主观信念与真实环境状态之间认知分歧中的交互作用，并构建了新基准enchname和轨迹式ToM数据集，通过强化学习提升模型对用户心理状态的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM虽强大，但难以准确理解模糊或不精确的用户意图，导致用户主观信念与真实环境状态之间存在认知分歧；而当前ToM评估多局限于孤立信念推理，忽视其在真实人机交互中的功能价值。

Method: 将ToM形式化为一种用于检测和解决认知分歧的机制，构建新基准enchname评估模型协调用户信念与画像的能力；进一步构建轨迹式ToM数据集，将信念追踪与任务相关状态推理关联，并采用强化学习训练模型。

Result: 在11个主流模型上的实验表明，现有模型普遍难以识别阻碍任务成功的深层认知差距；基于新数据集训练的模型在用户心理状态推理及下游任务性能上均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: ToM不应仅被视为一种独立的推理能力，而应作为关键的交互层面机制，对提升LLM实际交互效果具有重要实践价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have developed rapidly and are widely applied to both general-purpose and professional tasks to assist human users. However, they still struggle to comprehend and respond to the true user needs when intentions and instructions are imprecisely conveyed, leading to a divergence between subjective user believes and true environment states. Resolving this epistemic divergence requires Theory of Mind (ToM), yet existing ToM evaluations for LLMs primarily focus on isolated belief inference, overlooking its functional utility in real-world interaction. To this end, we formalize ToM for LLMs as a mechanism for epistemic divergence detection and resolution, and propose a benchmark, \benchname, to assess how models reconcile user beliefs and profiles in practice. Results across 11 leading models reveal a significant limitation to identify underlying cognitive gaps that impede task success. To bridge this gap, we further curate a trajectory-based ToM dataset linking belief tracking with task-related state inference. The model trained on this data via reinforcement learning shows consistent improvement in reasoning about user mental states, leading to enhanced downstream performance. Our work highlights the practical value of ToM as an essential interaction-level mechanism rather than as a standalone reasoning skill.

*Miles Williams,Young D. Kwon,Rui Li,Alexandros Kouris,Stylianos I. Venieris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SpecVocab，一种在每步解码中动态选择词汇子集的词汇推测方法，以替代缩减词汇表策略，从而在不牺牲推测有效性前提下提升推测长度与吞吐量，相比EAGLE-3最高提升8.1%平均吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码中，缩减 draft 模型词汇表虽可缓解输出分布瓶颈，但会导致目标词不在词汇表内时推测失效；本文旨在解决该权衡问题，提出更灵活有效的词汇推测机制。

Method: 提出SpecVocab方法，在每一步解码中基于目标模型预测动态选取一个高效、适配的词汇子集作为 draft 模型的输出空间，避免固定缩减词汇带来的覆盖损失。

Result: 在多项任务上，SpecVocab 的平均接受长度高于当前最优方法 EAGLE-3，并实现最高达 8.1% 的平均吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: 词汇推测（vocabulary speculation）是一种优于固定缩减词汇策略的新范式；SpecVocab 通过动态子集选择，在保持输出一致性的同时显著提升推测解码效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has rapidly emerged as a leading approach for accelerating language model (LM) inference, as it offers substantial speedups while yielding identical outputs. This relies upon a small draft model, tasked with predicting the outputs of the target model. State-of-the-art speculative decoding methods use a draft model consisting of a single decoder layer and output embedding matrix, with the latter dominating drafting time for the latest LMs. Recent work has sought to address this output distribution bottleneck by reducing the vocabulary of the draft model. Although this can improve throughput, it compromises speculation effectiveness when the target token is out-of-vocabulary. In this paper, we argue for vocabulary speculation as an alternative to a reduced vocabulary. We propose SpecVocab, an efficient and effective method that selects a vocabulary subset per decoding step. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that SpecVocab can achieve a higher acceptance length than state-of-the-art speculative decoding approach, EAGLE-3. Notably, this yields up to an 8.1% increase in average throughput over EAGLE-3.

### [179] [Index Light, Reason Deep: Deferred Visual Ingestion for Visual-Dense Document Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14162)
*Tao Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI)框架，采用需求驱动的视觉理解策略，在索引阶段仅提取轻量元数据，将VLM推理推迟至用户提问时进行，显著降低计算开销并提升视觉必要型问答的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态文档问答方法采用预处理式视觉理解（supply-side ingestion），存在高VLM token消耗、端到端不可靠、失败后不可恢复等问题。

Method: 提出DVI框架：索引阶段仅做元数据提取与BM25全文检索，定位候选页面；问答阶段才将原始图像与问题送入VLM进行定向分析；支持交互式精炼与渐进式缓存。

Result: 在两个真实工业工程图纸数据集上，DVI实现零VLM索引成本下的准确率（46.7% vs. 48.9%），视觉必要型查询有效率从0%提升至50%，页面定位率达100%（搜索空间压缩98%）。

Conclusion: DVI将多模态文档问答的核心挑战从‘答案生成’转向‘页面定位’，通过延迟视觉理解提升了效率、可靠性与可交互性，为工业级文档QA提供了新范式。

Abstract: Existing multimodal document question answering methods universally adopt a supply-side ingestion strategy: running a Vision-Language Model (VLM) on every page during indexing to generate comprehensive descriptions, then answering questions through text retrieval. However, this "pre-ingestion" approach is costly (a 113-page engineering drawing package requires approximately 80,000 VLM tokens), end-to-end unreliable (VLM outputs may fail to be correctly retrieved due to format mismatches in the retrieval infrastructure), and irrecoverable once it fails. This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is "Index for locating, not understanding"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression). DVI also supports interactive refinement and progressive caching, transforming the "QA accuracy" problem into a "page localization" problem--once the correct drawing page is found, obtaining the answer becomes a matter of interaction rounds.

*Yuhan Cheng,Hancheng Ye,Hai Helen Li,Jingwei Sun,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出PrivAct框架，通过将隐私偏好嵌入多智能体系统，使大语言模型在生成行为中内化上下文隐私保护，从而在个性化任务中实现隐私合规的智能体行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部、推理时干预，脆弱、场景特定且可能扩大隐私攻击面；而个性化任务中隐含的上下文隐私易导致隐私泄露。

Method: 提出PrivAct——一种上下文隐私感知的多智能体学习框架，将隐私偏好嵌入每个智能体，使其生成行为内化隐私保护。

Result: 在多个LLM主干和基准上实验表明，PrivAct显著降低隐私泄露率（最高达12.32%），同时保持帮助性，并具备零样本泛化能力和对多种多智能体拓扑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrivAct能有效提升系统级上下文完整性，在隐私与帮助性之间取得更优权衡，为LLM智能体的隐私安全部署提供新范式。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in personalized tasks involving sensitive, context-dependent information, where privacy violations may arise in agents' action due to the implicitness of contextual privacy. Existing approaches rely on external, inference-time interventions which are brittle, scenario-specific, and may expand the privacy attack surface. We propose PrivAct, a contextual privacy-aware multi-agent learning framework that internalizes contextual privacy preservation directly into models' generation behavior for privacy-compliant agentic actions. By embedding privacy preferences into each agent, PrivAct enhances system-wide contextual integrity while achieving a more favorable privacy-helpfulness tradeoff. Experiments across multiple LLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in contextual privacy preservation, reducing leakage rates by up to 12.32% while maintaining comparable helpfulness, as well as zero-shot generalization and robustness across diverse multi-agent topologies.

*Lingxiang Hu,Yiding Sun,Tianle Xia,Wenwei Li,Ming Xu,Liqun Liu,Peng Shu,Huan Yu,Jie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了AD-Bench，一个基于真实广告营销业务需求构建的评估基准，用于评测大语言模型代理在多轮、多工具协作下的复杂分析能力；实验表明当前最先进模型（如Gemini-3-Pro）在高难度任务上仍有显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理评测基准多限于理想化模拟，无法满足广告与营销分析等专业领域对多轮交互和专业工具协同的实际需求。

Method: 基于真实用户营销分析请求构建AD-Bench，由领域专家提供可验证参考答案及工具调用轨迹，并按L1–L3三级难度划分，支持多轮、多工具协作能力评估。

Result: Gemini-3-Pro在AD-Bench上整体Pass@1为68.0%，但在最难的L3级任务中降至49.4%；轨迹覆盖率仅70.1%，揭示模型在复杂营销分析中存在明显能力短板。

Conclusion: AD-Bench填补了真实业务场景下LLM代理评测的空白，为广告营销智能体的评估与改进提供了实用、可扩展的基准平台。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents have achieved remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, evaluating their performance in real-world environments has become a critical problem. Current benchmarks, however, are largely restricted to idealized simulations, failing to address the practical demands of specialized domains like advertising and marketing analytics. In these fields, tasks are inherently more complex, often requiring multi-round interaction with professional marketing tools. To address this gap, we propose AD-Bench, a benchmark designed based on real-world business requirements of advertising and marketing platforms. AD-Bench is constructed from real user marketing analysis requests, with domain experts providing verifiable reference answers and corresponding reference tool-call trajectories. The benchmark categorizes requests into three difficulty levels (L1-L3) to evaluate agents' capabilities under multi-round, multi-tool collaboration. Experiments show that on AD-Bench, Gemini-3-Pro achieves Pass@1 = 68.0% and Pass@3 = 83.0%, but performance drops significantly on L3 to Pass@1 = 49.4% and Pass@3 = 62.1%, with a trajectory coverage of 70.1%, indicating that even state-of-the-art models still exhibit substantial capability gaps in complex advertising and marketing analysis scenarios. AD-Bench provides a realistic benchmark for evaluating and improving advertising marketing agents, the leaderboard and code can be found at https://github.com/Emanual20/adbench-leaderboard.

*Naeimeh Nourmohammadi,Md Meem Hossain,The Anh Han,Safina Showkat Ara,Zia Ush Shamszaman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多智能体医疗问答框架，通过结合多个微调的大型语言模型（GPT、LLaMA、DeepSeek R1）、证据检索、不确定性估计和偏见检测，提升临床问答的可靠性、可解释性与安全性。实验表明该系统准确率达87%，显著优于基线模型，并具备证据支撑与风险可控特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗问答中面临验证能力弱、证据支撑不足、置信度信号不可靠等问题，限制其临床落地。

Method: 分两阶段：第一阶段在MedQuAD数据上微调三类LLM并评估生成质量；第二阶段构建模块化多智能体流水线，包括临床推理代理（LLaMA）、证据检索代理（PubMed查询）和精炼代理（DeepSeek R1），辅以不确定性估计（蒙特卡洛Dropout、困惑度评分）与偏见检测（词法/情感分析+LIME/SHAP）。

Result: DeepSeek R1在生成指标上最优（ROUGE-1 0.536±0.04等），整体系统准确率87%，相关性约0.80，困惑度降至4.13，端到端延迟36.5秒；证据增强有效降低不确定性，且支持高风险场景人工介入。

Conclusion: 多智能体协同与验证机制能有效缓解单模型局限，为可信赖、可追溯、低偏见的医疗AI提供实用、可扩展的设计范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for healthcare question answering, but clinical use is limited by weak verification, insufficient evidence grounding, and unreliable confidence signalling. We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在人工智能中日益重要，亟需从通用架构转向具备上下文感知、内在安全性及尊重全球文化差异的系统。

Method: 方法上从经典监督式领域适配出发，延伸至解码时安全对齐，并最终结合人类反馈与偏好建模实现社会语言学层面的精准适配。

Result: 构建了涵盖技术精度、对抗鲁棒性与全球文化包容性的三位一体‘负责任智能’框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为大语言模型在真实场景中的可信、安全与普适部署提供了系统性路径。

Abstract: The overarching research direction of this work is the development of a ''Responsible Intelligence'' framework designed to reconcile the immense generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the stringent requirements of real-world deployment. As these models become a transformative force in artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to move beyond general-purpose architectures toward systems that are contextually aware, inherently safer, and deeply respectful of global cultural nuances. This research navigates three interconnected threads: domain adaptation to ensure technical precision, ethical rigor to mitigate adversarial vulnerabilities, and cultural/multilingual alignment to promote global inclusivity. The methodological trajectory moves from classical supervised adaptation for task-specific demands to decoding-time alignment for safety, finally leveraging human feedback and preference modeling to achieve sociolinguistic acuity.

Motivation: 现有科学创意评估方法存在知识视野狭窄、评估维度单一以及大语言模型作为裁判的固有偏差等问题，亟需更贴近人类专家判断的知识驱动、多视角、多标准评估方法。

Method: 将创意评估建模为知识驱动的多视角推理问题；构建异构深度知识搜索引擎，从多样化在线源检索并锚定动态证据；设计包含不同学术背景评审员的创新评审委员会，实现跨多个指标的多维解耦评估。

Result: InnoEval在逐点、成对及组别评估任务中持续优于基线方法，其判断模式与共识结果高度契合人类专家。

Conclusion: InnoEval为科学创意评估提供了更可靠、可解释且接近人类水平的自动化框架，有效弥补了当前LLM时代创意生成与评估能力之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models has catalyzed a surge in scientific idea production, yet this leap has not been accompanied by a matching advance in idea evaluation. The fundamental nature of scientific evaluation needs knowledgeable grounding, collective deliberation, and multi-criteria decision-making. However, existing idea evaluation methods often suffer from narrow knowledge horizons, flattened evaluation dimensions, and the inherent bias in LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval. Experiments demonstrate that InnoEval can consistently outperform baselines in point-wise, pair-wise, and group-wise evaluation tasks, exhibiting judgment patterns and consensus highly aligned with human experts.

TL;DR: 本文指出当前大型语言模型的安全机制在低资源语言和混合语码输入中表现不佳，提出针对全球南方地区的多语言安全研究议程，强调文化适配的评估、参数高效的安全调控及社区参与式工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全管道、基准和对齐方法主要面向英语和高资源语言，忽视了全球南方地区低资源语言、语码混用和文化特异性带来的安全挑战，且已有证据表明安全性和事实性无法简单跨语言迁移。

Method: 综合近期研究成果，分析安全防护在低资源和混合语码输入中的失效现象；提出面向全球南方的研究议程，包括参数高效的安全引导、文化嵌入的评估与偏好数据构建、以及赋能本地社区的参与式工作流程。

Result: 揭示了三大问题：(i)安全护栏在低资源和代码混用输入下显著弱化；(ii)文化有害行为可能在毒性分数看似正常时仍持续存在；(iii)仅基于英语的知识编辑和安全补丁难以迁移到低资源语言。

Conclusion: 应将多语言安全作为全球南方地区公平AI的核心要求，而非附加功能，并呼吁研究者与当地社区协作推动文化适配的安全实践。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being deployed across the Global South, where everyday use involves low-resource languages, code-mixing, and culturally specific norms. Yet safety pipelines, benchmarks, and alignment still largely target English and a handful of high-resource languages, implicitly assuming safety and factuality ''transfer'' across languages. Evidence increasingly shows they do not. We synthesize recent findings indicating that (i) safety guardrails weaken sharply on low-resource and code-mixed inputs, (ii) culturally harmful behavior can persist even when standard toxicity scores look acceptable, and (iii) English-only knowledge edits and safety patches often fail to carry over to low-resource languages. In response, we outline a practical agenda for researchers and students in the Global South: parameter-efficient safety steering, culturally grounded evaluation and preference data, and participatory workflows that empower local communities to define and mitigate harm. Our aim is to make multilingual safety a core requirement-not an add-on-for equitable AI in underrepresented regions.

TL;DR: 本文提出Query-as-Anchor框架，通过动态查询感知的用户表征学习，结合多模态预训练数据集UserU、Q-Anchor嵌入架构及基于聚类的软提示调优，显著提升工业级用户建模的通用性与任务敏感性，并在支付宝10个基准测试及线上A/B测试中验证其SOTA性能与高效部署能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户表征方法多为静态、任务无关的嵌入，难以兼顾下游任务多样性；同时，多源异构数据带来的噪声和模态冲突进一步损害表征质量。

Method: 提出Query-as-Anchor框架：构建工业级多模态预训练数据集UserU；设计Q-Anchor嵌入架构，融合粗到细分层编码器与双塔LLM，采用联合对比-自回归优化；引入基于聚类的软提示调优以对齐场景特异性模态；部署时将查询锚定在序列末尾，支持KV缓存加速推理。

Result: 在10个支付宝工业基准上达到SOTA；大规模线上A/B测试验证其在真实业务场景中的有效性；具备强可扩展性与低延迟部署能力。

Conclusion: Query-as-Anchor成功实现了用户表征从静态编码向动态查询感知合成的范式转变，在保持模型通用性的同时显著增强任务敏感性，为工业级大模型驱动的用户理解提供了新路径。

Abstract: Industrial-scale user representation learning requires balancing robust universality with acute task-sensitivity. However, existing paradigms primarily yield static, task-agnostic embeddings that struggle to reconcile the divergent requirements of downstream scenarios within unified vector spaces. Furthermore, heterogeneous multi-source data introduces inherent noise and modality conflicts, degrading representation. We propose Query-as-Anchor, a framework shifting user modeling from static encoding to dynamic, query-aware synthesis. To empower Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep user understanding, we first construct UserU, an industrial-scale pre-training dataset that aligns multi-modal behavioral sequences with user understanding semantics, and our Q-Anchor Embedding architecture integrates hierarchical coarse-to-fine encoders into dual-tower LLMs via joint contrastive-autoregressive optimization for query-aware user representation. To bridge the gap between general pre-training and specialized business logic, we further introduce Cluster-based Soft Prompt Tuning to enforce discriminative latent structures, effectively aligning model attention with scenario-specific modalities. For deployment, anchoring queries at sequence termini enables KV-cache-accelerated inference with negligible incremental latency. Evaluations on 10 Alipay industrial benchmarks show consistent SOTA performance, strong scalability, and efficient deployment. Large-scale online A/B testing in Alipay's production system across two real-world scenarios further validates its practical effectiveness. Our code is prepared for public release and will be available at: https://github.com/JhCircle/Q-Anchor.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语中蕴含丰富复杂的礼貌表达，但目前缺乏面向阿拉伯语的礼貌检测资源，亟需构建符合阿拉伯语言传统与语用理论的高质量数据集。

Method: 基于阿拉伯语言传统与语用理论，从社交媒体、电商和客服等四个平台收集并标注阿拉伯语文本，定义polite/impolite/neutral三类标签，并标注16类礼貌语言特征；对40种模型（包括传统机器学习、Transformer及大语言模型）进行基准测试。

Result: 构建了含10,000样本的ADAB数据集，覆盖多方言，实现较高标注一致性（kappa=0.703），并提供了全面的模型基准结果。

Conclusion: ADAB填补了阿拉伯语礼貌检测资源的空白，为构建文化敏感的阿拉伯语NLP系统提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The growing importance of culturally-aware natural language processing systems has led to an increasing demand for resources that capture sociopragmatic phenomena across diverse languages. Nevertheless, Arabic-language resources for politeness detection remain under-explored, despite the rich and complex politeness expressions embedded in Arabic communication. In this paper, we introduce ADAB (Arabic Politeness Dataset), a new annotated Arabic dataset collected from four online platforms, including social media, e-commerce, and customer service domains, covering Modern Standard Arabic and multiple dialects (Gulf, Egyptian, Levantine, and Maghrebi). The dataset was annotated based on Arabic linguistic traditions and pragmatic theory, resulting in three classes: polite, impolite, and neutral. It contains 10,000 samples with linguistic feature annotations across 16 politeness categories and achieves substantial inter-annotator agreement (kappa = 0.703). We benchmark 40 model configurations, including traditional machine learning, transformer-based models, and large language models. The dataset aims to support research on politeness-aware Arabic NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化小型语言模型（SLMs）在复杂多-hop问答任务中的RAG性能存在研究空白，尤其提示模板设计这一关键但被忽视的因素亟需系统探究。

Method: 在HotpotQA数据集上对24种提示模板（含标准RAG、9种文献方法、14种新混合变体）进行大规模实验，使用Qwen2.5-3B Instruct和Gemma3-4B-It两个SLM，在18720个测试样本上评估。

Result: 新型混合提示模板带来最高83%（Qwen2.5）和84.5%（Gemma3-4B-It）的性能提升，相较标准RAG提示平均提升达6%。

Conclusion: 提示模板设计对SLM-RAG性能影响巨大；所提出的混合模板及分析为资源受限环境下高效RAG部署提供了切实可行的指导。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach for enhancing the factual grounding of language models by integrating external knowledge. While widely studied for large language models, the optimization of RAG for Small Language Models (SLMs) remains a critical research gap, particularly in complex, multi-hop question-answering tasks that require sophisticated reasoning. In these systems, prompt template design is a crucial yet under-explored factor influencing performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to investigate this factor, evaluating 24 different prompt templates on the HotpotQA dataset. The set includes a standard RAG prompt, nine well-formed techniques from the literature, and 14 novel hybrid variants, all tested on two prominent SLMs: Qwen2.5-3B Instruct and Gemma3-4B-It. Our findings, based on a test set of 18720 instances, reveal significant performance gains of up to 83% on Qwen2.5 and 84.5% on Gemma3-4B-It, yielding an improvement of up to 6% for both models compared to the Standard RAG prompt. This research also offers concrete analysis and actionable recommendations for designing effective and efficient prompts for SLM-based RAG systems, practically for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有ATR模型在古文字转录与标准化数字版本之间存在方法论鸿沟：面向古文字的模型输出难以被读者和下游NLP工具使用，而直接输出标准化结果的模型则泛化性差、易过度规范化和幻觉。

Method: 提出预编辑规范化（PEN）新任务；基于CoMMA语料构建466万样本的银标训练集和1800样本的人工校对金标测试集；采用ByT5序列到序列模型进行规范化与预标注任务基准测试。

Result: 构建了首个PEN任务专用数据集（含银标训练集与金标测试集）；ByT5模型在该任务上达到6.7% CER，显著优于先前模型。

Conclusion: PEN任务有效弥合了古文字识别与实用化数字编辑之间的鸿沟，兼顾古文字保真性与标准化可用性，所提数据集与模型为历史文本数字化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Text Recognition (ATR) have improved access to historical archives, yet a methodological divide persists between palaeographic transcriptions and normalized digital editions. While ATR models trained on more palaeographically-oriented datasets such as CATMuS have shown greater generalizability, their raw outputs remain poorly compatible with most readers and downstream NLP tools, thus creating a usability gap. On the other hand, ATR models trained to produce normalized outputs have been shown to struggle to adapt to new domains and tend to over-normalize and hallucinate. We introduce the task of Pre-Editorial Normalization (PEN), which consists in normalizing graphemic ATR output according to editorial conventions, which has the advantage of keeping an intermediate step with palaeographic fidelity while providing a normalized version for practical usability. We present a new dataset derived from the CoMMA corpus and aligned with digitized Old French and Latin editions using passim. We also produce a manually corrected gold-standard evaluation set. We benchmark this resource using ByT5-based sequence-to-sequence models on normalization and pre-annotation tasks. Our contributions include the formal definition of PEN, a 4.66M-sample silver training corpus, a 1.8k-sample gold evaluation set, and a normalization model achieving a 6.7% CER, substantially outperforming previous models for this task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HLE-Verified，一个经过专家验证与修订的HLE基准测试新版本，通过两阶段流程（验证与修复）显著降低了原始基准中的标注噪声，提升了模型评估的准确性与可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HLE作为前沿大语言模型评测基准存在较多噪声项，影响评估结果的公平性与可比性，亟需构建更可靠、透明的修订版本。

Method: 提出两阶段验证与修复工作流：第一阶段对每道题进行问题与答案的二元验证（专家评审+模型交叉检查），得到641个已验证题目；第二阶段对可修复的错误题目进行双专家独立修订、模型辅助审计与最终裁决，生成1170个修订认证题目；剩余689题归为带明确错误来源与专家标签的‘不确定集’。

Result: 在7个SOTA模型上评测显示，HLE-Verified相比原始HLE平均准确率提升7–10个百分点；对原题干或答案有误的题目，提升达30–40个百分点；且模型置信度与题目错误存在强相关，印证修订有效性。

Conclusion: HLE-Verified通过系统化验证与透明修订机制，显著降低HLE类基准的标注噪声，使模型能力评估更真实、稳健，为未来高质量评测基准建设提供了方法论范例。

Abstract: Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) has become a widely used benchmark for evaluating frontier large language models on challenging, multi-domain questions. However, community-led analyses have raised concerns that HLE contains a non-trivial number of noisy items, which can bias evaluation results and distort cross-model comparisons. To address this challenge, we introduce HLE-Verified, a verified and revised version of HLE with a transparent verification protocol and fine-grained error taxonomy. Our construction follows a two-stage validation-and-repair workflow resulting in a certified benchmark. In Stage I, each item undergoes binary validation of the problem and final answer through domain-expert review and model-based cross-checks, yielding 641 verified items. In Stage II, flawed but fixable items are revised under strict constraints preserving the original evaluation intent, through dual independent expert repairs, model-assisted auditing, and final adjudication, resulting in 1,170 revised-and-certified items. The remaining 689 items are released as a documented uncertain set with explicit uncertainty sources and expertise tags for future refinement. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art language models on HLE and HLE-Verified, observing an average absolute accuracy gain of 7--10 percentage points on HLE-Verified. The improvement is particularly pronounced on items where the original problem statement and/or reference answer is erroneous, with gains of 30--40 percentage points. Our analyses further reveal a strong association between model confidence and the presence of errors in the problem statement or reference answer, supporting the effectiveness of our revisions. Overall, HLE-Verified improves HLE-style evaluations by reducing annotation noise and enabling more faithful measurement of model capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，利用大语言模型从跨域用户信号中生成兴趣驱动的新闻搜索查询列表，通过GRPO优化策略，并采用在线策略蒸馏实现高效部署，在离线实验和线上A/B测试中均取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域新闻推荐中如何从异构用户信号中挖掘深层、可复用的用户兴趣，并兼顾大规模生产系统的可扩展性问题。

Method: 构建基于强化学习的框架，将查询列表生成建模为策略优化问题，采用GRPO算法结合多维度奖励信号；系统研究推理采样与模型容量两个计算维度；最后通过在线策略蒸馏将大教师模型知识迁移到轻量级学生模型。

Result: 在离线实验、消融研究及大规模线上A/B测试中均验证了该方法在兴趣建模质量和下游推荐性能上的持续提升，并展现出类似缩放定律的计算增益规律。

Conclusion: 该方法有效 bridged 深度兴趣建模与工业级可部署性之间的鸿沟，为跨域新闻推荐提供了新范式。

Abstract: News recommendation plays a critical role in online news platforms by helping users discover relevant content. Cross-domain news recommendation further requires inferring user's underlying information needs from heterogeneous signals that often extend beyond direct news consumption. A key challenge lies in moving beyond surface-level behaviors to capture deeper, reusable user interests while maintaining scalability in large-scale production systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to generate high-quality lists of interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain user signals. We formulate query-list generation as a policy optimization problem and employ GRPO with multiple reward signals. We systematically study two compute dimensions: inference-time sampling and model capacity, and empirically observe consistent improvements with increased compute that exhibit scaling-like behavior. Finally, we perform on-policy distillation to transfer the learned policy from a large, compute-intensive teacher to a compact student model suitable for scalable deployment. Extensive offline experiments, ablation studies and large-scale online A/B tests in a production news recommendation system demonstrate consistent gains in both interest modeling quality and downstream recommendation performance.

*Tongze Zhang,Jun-En Ding,Melik Ozolcer,Fang-Ming Hung,Albert Chih-Chieh Yang,Feng Liu,Yi-Rou Ji,Sang Won Bae*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）与思维链（CoT）推理的阿尔茨海默病（AD）诊断新方法，利用电子健康记录（EHR）进行可解释、分阶段的AD评估，在CDR分级任务中F1分数提升达15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AD诊断依赖耗时耗力的医学影像和医生临床评估；现有LLM在医疗领域应用增多，但在AD评估中受限于其复杂多因素病因及影像难以直接观测的特点。

Method: 采用LLM对患者EHR进行Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理，生成显式诊断推理路径，并据此输出结构化预测，而非直接微调LLM进行AD分类。

Result: 所提CoT诊断框架在多个CDR分级任务上显著提升稳定性与诊断性能，F1分数较零样本基线最高提升15%。

Conclusion: CoT推理能有效增强LLM对AD复杂病因的理解与建模能力，同时提升诊断过程的可解释性与跨疾病阶段泛化性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Traditional diagnosis still relies heavily on medical imaging and clinical assessment by physicians, which is often time-consuming and resource-intensive in terms of both human expertise and healthcare resources. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to the medical field using electronic health records (EHRs), yet their application in Alzheimer's disease assessment remains limited, particularly given that AD involves complex multifactorial etiologies that are difficult to observe directly through imaging modalities. In this work, we propose leveraging LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning on patients' clinical EHRs. Unlike direct fine-tuning of LLMs on EHR data for AD classification, our approach utilizes LLM-generated CoT reasoning paths to provide the model with explicit diagnostic rationale for AD assessment, followed by structured CoT-based predictions. This pipeline not only enhances the model's ability to diagnose intrinsically complex factors but also improves the interpretability of the prediction process across different stages of AD progression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CoT-based diagnostic framework significantly enhances stability and diagnostic performance across multiple CDR grading tasks, achieving up to a 15% improvement in F1 score compared to the zero-shot baseline method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型中自解释（如思维链推理）的充分性与简洁性之间的权衡，提出基于信息瓶颈原理将解释视为压缩表示，并通过约束长度和多模型评估验证其在英语和波斯语上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自解释虽能提升多步问答性能，但往往冗长且生成成本高，需探究所需解释的最小必要量。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理，将解释建模为保留答案所需关键信息的压缩表示；设计长度受限的评估流程，在ARC Challenge数据集上用多个语言模型评估充分性，并扩展至英语和翻译的波斯语版本。

Result: 实验表明，更简洁的解释常仍具充分性，可在保持准确率的同时显著缩短长度；但过度压缩会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 解释存在最优简洁度——足够支持正确答案又避免冗余，该发现对高效、低资源场景下的解释生成具有指导意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models increasingly rely on self-explanations, such as chain of thought reasoning, to improve performance on multi step question answering. While these explanations enhance accuracy, they are often verbose and costly to generate, raising the question of how much explanation is truly necessary. In this paper, we examine the trade-off between sufficiency, defined as the ability of an explanation to justify the correct answer, and conciseness, defined as the reduction in explanation length. Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation. Our experiments show that more concise explanations often remain sufficient, preserving accuracy while substantially reducing explanation length, whereas excessive compression leads to performance degradation.

Conclusion: Transformer类模型（尤其领域适配的PaymentBERT）是金融NER任务的最优选择，兼顾精度、效率与实用性，为金融机构落地合规与自动化系统提供可靠技术路径。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) has emerged as a critical component in automating financial transaction processing, particularly in extracting structured information from unstructured payment data. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art NER algorithms specifically designed for payment data extraction, including Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with CRF (BiLSTM-CRF), and transformer-based models such as BERT and FinBERT. We conduct extensive experiments on a dataset of 50,000 annotated payment transactions across multiple payment formats including SWIFT MT103, ISO 20022, and domestic payment systems.

We provide detailed analysis of cross-format generalization, ablation studies, and deployment considerations. This research provides practical insights for financial institutions implementing automated sanctions screening, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and payment processing systems.

*Sen Yang,Shanbo Cheng,Lu Xu,Jianbing Zhang,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的组质量度量范式GQM及其具体实现GRRM，用于提升GRPO在机器翻译等开放域任务中的效果；GRRM通过联合处理候选译文组进行比较分析，显著提升排序准确性，并集成进GRPO训练流程，从而同时提升翻译质量和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准标量质量指标（SQM）在机器翻译等开放域任务中因孤立评估候选译文而难以捕捉细微语言差异，导致组内排序不准，限制了GRPO的效果。

Method: 提出组质量度量（GQM）范式，设计组相对奖励模型（GRRM），使其联合处理整个候选译文组，进行对比建模以实现细粒度相对质量判断；并将GRRM嵌入GRPO训练循环中优化翻译策略。

Result: GRRM在排名准确率上优于所有基线；集成GRRM的GRPO框架显著提升机器翻译质量，并使模型展现出媲美先进推理模型的推理能力。

Conclusion: GQM/GRRM为开放域LLM后训练提供了更鲁棒的组内排序机制，是提升GRPO在翻译及潜在其他生成任务中性能的关键改进。

Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offers a powerful framework for LLM post-training, its effectiveness in open-ended domains like Machine Translation hinges on accurate intra-group ranking. We identify that standard Scalar Quality Metrics (SQM) fall short in this context; by evaluating candidates in isolation, they lack the comparative context necessary to distinguish fine-grained linguistic nuances. To address this, we introduce the Group Quality Metric (GQM) paradigm and instantiate it via the Group Relative Reward Model (GRRM). Unlike traditional independent scorers, GRRM processes the entire candidate group jointly, leveraging comparative analysis to rigorously resolve relative quality and adaptive granularity. Empirical evaluations confirm that GRRM achieves competitive ranking accuracy among all baselines. Building on this foundation, we integrate GRRM into the GRPO training loop to optimize the translation policy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only improves general translation quality but also unlocks reasoning capabilities comparable to state-of-the-art reasoning models. We release codes, datasets, and model checkpoints at https://github.com/NJUNLP/GRRM.

*Sajjad Kachuee,Mohammad Sharifkhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文指出MoE嵌入模型中线性加权聚合假设与专家表征的实际几何结构（超球面流形）不一致，导致向量失真；为此提出球面重心聚合（SBA）方法，分离径向与角向分量以保持几何一致性，并在MTEB多个任务上验证了其有效性与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE嵌入模型中常用的线性加权聚合隐含线性子空间假设，但实际专家输出位于具有集中模长和大角度分离的共享超球面流形上，该假设与真实几何不一致，导致聚合后向量坍缩、可比性下降。

Method: 提出球面重心聚合（SBA），将聚合过程解耦为径向（模长）与角向（方向）两部分，在保持超球面结构的同时兼容现有路由机制。

Result: 在MTEB的语义相似性、聚类和重复问题检测等任务上，SBA在训练成本和稳定性不变的前提下，带来一致性能提升；几何分析证实其有效防止聚合坍缩并维持超球面一致性。

Conclusion: MoE嵌入架构中需采用几何感知的聚合方式；SBA作为一种结构保持、即插即用的替代方案，凸显了几何建模对提升嵌入质量的关键作用。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) embedding models combine expert outputs using weighted linear summation, implicitly assuming a linear subspace structure in the embedding space. This assumption is shown to be inconsistent with the geometry of expert representations. Geometric analysis of a modern MoE embedding model reveals that expert outputs lie on a shared hyperspherical manifold characterized by tightly concentrated norms and substantial angular separation. Under this geometry, linear aggregation induces inward collapse toward the manifold interior, distorting vector magnitude and direction and reducing embedding comparability. To address this inconsistency, Spherical Barycentric Aggregation (SBA) is introduced as a geometry-preserving aggregation operator that separates radial and angular components to maintain hyperspherical structure while remaining fully compatible with existing routing mechanisms. Experiments on selected tasks from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), including semantic similarity, clustering, and duplicate question detection, demonstrate consistent performance improvements with identical training cost and full stability. Additional geometric analyses confirm that SBA prevents aggregation-induced collapse and preserves hyperspherical consistency, highlighting the importance of geometry-aware aggregation in MoE embedding architectures.

*Pietro Bernardelle,Stefano Civelli,Kevin Roitero,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在长上下文事实验证任务中的性能变化，发现其准确率随上下文增长而下降，且证据在提示中的位置（首/尾优于中间）显著影响验证效果，强调了检索增强型事实核查中提示结构的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多种推理任务中表现出色，但其在长上下文下的表现仍不稳定；已有研究关注问答中的中段上下文衰退，本文则聚焦于事实验证任务中上下文长度与证据位置的影响。

Method: 在HOVER、FEVEROUS和ClimateFEVER三个数据集上，使用五种开源模型（涵盖Llama-3.1、Qwen2.5和Qwen3，参数量为7B、32B和70B），评估模型的参数化事实知识及不同上下文长度和证据位置对验证准确率的影响。

Result: LLMs具备显著的参数化事实知识；验证准确率随上下文长度增加而普遍下降；证据置于提示开头或结尾时准确率显著高于置于中间位置。

Conclusion: 上下文长度与证据位置是影响LLM事实验证性能的关键因素，提示结构设计对检索增强型事实核查系统至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning abilities across diverse tasks, yet their performance on extended contexts remains inconsistent. While prior research has emphasized mid-context degradation in question answering, this study examines the impact of context in LLM-based fact verification. Using three datasets (HOVER, FEVEROUS, and ClimateFEVER) and five open-source models accross different parameters sizes (7B, 32B and 70B parameters) and model families (Llama-3.1, Qwen2.5 and Qwen3), we evaluate both parametric factual knowledge and the impact of evidence placement across varying context lengths. We find that LLMs exhibit non-trivial parametric knowledge of factual claims and that their verification accuracy generally declines as context length increases. Similarly to what has been shown in previous works, in-context evidence placement plays a critical role with accuracy being consistently higher when relevant evidence appears near the beginning or end of the prompt and lower when placed mid-context. These results underscore the importance of prompt structure in retrieval-augmented fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出LogitsCoder框架，通过轻量级logit级控制机制提升代码生成中的思维链推理质量，解决现有测试时扩展方法中存在的‘思考不足’和‘过度思考’问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展（TTS）方法在代码生成中存在‘思考不足’（推理链过浅）和‘过度思考’（推理冗长低效）两大问题，限制了推理的深度与效率平衡。

Method: 提出LogitsCoder框架，包含Logits Preference Decoding（引导token选择至统计偏好模式）和Logits Rank Based Path Selection & Thoughts Aggregation（基于logit排序选择并聚合多样化推理路径）。

Result: 实验表明LogitsCoder生成的推理链更高效、高质量，在代码生成任务上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LogitsCoder通过logit层面的轻量控制实现了深度与效率兼顾的推理链构建，为代码生成中的可控推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Code generation remains a challenging task that requires precise and structured reasoning. Existing Test Time Scaling (TTS) methods, including structured tree search, have made progress in exploring reasoning paths but still face two major challenges: (1) underthinking, where reasoning chains tend to be shallow and fail to capture the full complexity of problems; and (2) overthinking, where overly verbose reasoning leads to inefficiency and increased computational costs. To address these issues, we propose LogitsCoder, a novel framework that enhances chain-of-thought reasoning through lightweight, logit-level control mechanisms for code generation. LogitsCoder iteratively generates and refines reasoning steps by first steering token selection toward statistically preferred patterns via Logits Preference Decoding, then selecting and aggregating diverse reasoning paths using Logits Rank Based Path Selection and Thoughts Aggregation. This results in coherent and effective reasoning chains that balance depth and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogitsCoder produces more efficient and higher-quality reasoning chains, leading to superior code generation performance compared to baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LM-Lexicon是一种创新的定义建模方法，通过数据聚类、语义专家学习和稀疏混合专家架构融合模型，在五个基准测试中显著提升性能（BLEU分数提高7%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升定义建模任务的性能，解决现有方法在语义密集型应用中的效率与质量瓶颈。

Method: 采用数据聚类划分语义领域，训练小型语言模型作为领域专家，并设计语义感知的领域级路由机制，结合稀疏混合专家架构进行模型合并。

Result: 在五个主流基准上BLEU分数较先前最优模型提升7%；聚类策略使定义质量提升近10%；领域级路由比传统词元级路由专家效能高1%；测试时计算与专家扩展可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: LM-Lexicon推动了定义建模的发展，并为语义密集型任务中高效语言模型的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce LM-Lexicon, an innovative definition modeling approach that incorporates data clustering, semantic expert learning, and model merging using a sparse mixture-of-experts architecture. By decomposing the definition modeling task into specialized semantic domains, where small language models are trained as domain experts, LM-Lexicon achieves substantial improvements (+7% BLEU score compared with the prior state-of-the-art model) over existing methods on five widely used benchmarks. Empirically, we demonstrate that 1) the clustering strategy enables fine-grained expert specialization with nearly 10% improvement in definition quality; 2) the semantic-aware domain-level routing mechanism achieves higher expert efficacy (+1%) than conventional token-level routing; and 3) further performance gains can be obtained through test-time compute and semantic expert scaling. Our work advances definition modeling while providing insights into the development of efficient language models for semantic-intensive applications.

*Jandad Jahani,Mursal Dawodi,Jawid Ahmad Baktash*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对Mozilla Common Voice语料库中普什图语（Pashto）数据集（v24.0，2025年12月）进行了发布级分析，揭示其规模快速增长（达2768.7小时），但存在贡献者高度集中（Gini=0.941）、年龄与性别标签缺失严重、文本提示复用适度等关键数据质量与代表性问题，为低资源语言ASR数据建设提供了实证审计与改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决普什图语这一使用超6000万人的语言长期缺乏大规模、开源许可语音数据的问题，支撑现代ASR系统开发。

Method: 对Common Voice Pashto组件（v24.0）开展发布级定量分析，涵盖时长增长趋势、验证吞吐量、贡献者不平等性（Gini系数）、人口统计元数据完整性（年龄、性别）、以及句子级提示复用分布（如50%剪辑覆盖的唯一句子比例）。

Result: 普什图语数据从2023年中1.49小时增至2025年2768.7小时（含975.89小时已验证）；贡献者极度集中（Gini=0.941）；年龄偏向年轻人；41.97%音频缺失自报性别标签；35.88%唯一句子覆盖50%已验证剪辑。

Conclusion: 该数据集虽规模快速提升，但在贡献公平性、人口代表性与元数据完整性方面仍不成熟；需优先增强验证能力与扩大多元人群参与，以提升低资源语音数据集的实用性与可信度。

Abstract: Large, openly licensed speech datasets are essential for building automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, yet many widely spoken languages remain underrepresented in public resources. Pashto, spoken by more than 60 million people, has historically lacked large-scale openly licensed speech data suitable for modern ASR development.
  This paper presents a release-level analysis of the Pashto component of the Mozilla Common Voice corpus, focusing on version 24.0 (December 2025) and contextualizing trends across major releases. We document rapid growth from 1.49 recorded hours in mid-2023 to 2,768.7 total hours in 2025, including 975.89 validated hours available for supervised ASR training.
  Beyond scale, we analyze validation throughput, contributor participation inequality, demographic metadata completeness, and sentence-level concentration in the validated subset. We find that participation is extremely concentrated (Gini = 0.941), age representation is strongly skewed toward young adults, and 41.97\% of clips lack self-reported gender labels, limiting subgroup auditing based on metadata. At the textual level, prompt reuse is moderate: 35.88\% of unique sentences account for 50\% of validated clips, suggesting that structural concentration is driven primarily by uneven contributor activity rather than dominance of a small prompt set.
  These results provide a quantitative audit of a rapidly scaling low-resource speech corpus and highlight practical priorities for improving dataset maturity, including expanded validation capacity and broader demographic participation.

*Ruipeng Jia,Yunyi Yang,Yuxin Wu,Yongbo Gai,Siyuan Tao,Mengyu Zhou,Jianhe Lin,Xiaoxi Jiang,Guanjun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Open Rubric System（OpenRS），一种基于可解释评分标准的LLM-as-a-Judge框架，通过显式元评分标准（PAMR）与可验证的点式评分标准（PVRs）替代标量奖励模型，以解决开放性对齐任务中因信息压缩导致的奖励劫持与泛化脆弱问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标量奖励模型将多维人类偏好压缩为单一不可解释分数，造成信息瓶颈，导致在非可验证任务中鲁棒性差、易发生奖励劫持；作者认为稳健对齐本质是原则泛化问题，奖励应是可检验的推理过程，而非内化的黑箱函数。

Method: 提出OpenRS框架，核心包括：1）Pairwise Adaptive Meta-Rubrics（PAMR），即宪法式元评分标准，指导评分标准的动态实例化、加权与执行；2）Pointwise Verifiable Rubrics（PVRs），提供硬约束护栏与可验证奖励信号；3）两层元评分标准优化流程（自动化进化优化通用原则 + 人机协同优化领域原则）；4）在RL训练中作为成对奖励监督信号。

Result: OpenRS在开放性任务中显著提升判别能力，避免点式加权标量化，增强可解释性与可控性；PVRs有效防止退化行为，并为客观子任务提供可验证奖励；元评分标准支持跨域一致且可编辑的原则管理。

Conclusion: 用显式、可检验、自适应的评分标准体系替代标量奖励模型，是实现非可验证任务稳健对齐的关键路径；OpenRS为LLM对齐提供了可插拔、原则驱动、可验证的新范式。

Abstract: Scalar reward models compress multi-dimensional human preferences into a single opaque score, creating an information bottleneck that often leads to brittleness and reward hacking in open-ended alignment. We argue that robust alignment for non-verifiable tasks is fundamentally a principle generalization problem: reward should not be a learned function internalized into a judge, but an explicit reasoning process executed under inspectable principles. To operationalize this view, we present the Open Rubric System (OpenRS), a plug-and-play, rubrics-based LLM-as-a-Judge framework built around Pairwise Adaptive Meta-Rubrics (PAMR) and lightweight Pointwise Verifiable Rubrics (PVRs), which provide both hard-constraint guardrails and verifiable reward components when ground-truth or programmatic checks are available. OpenRS uses an explicit meta-rubric -- a constitution-like specification that governs how rubrics are instantiated, weighted, and enforced -- and instantiates adaptive rubrics on the fly by conditioning on the semantic differences between two candidate responses. It then performs criterion-wise pairwise comparisons and aggregates criterion-level preferences externally, avoiding pointwise weighted scalarization while improving discriminability in open-ended settings. To keep principles consistent yet editable across various domains, we introduce a two-level meta-rubric refinement pipeline (automated evolutionary refinement for general principles and a reproducible human-in-the-loop procedure for domain principles), complemented with pointwise verifiable rubrics that act as both guardrails against degenerate behaviors and a source of verifiable reward for objective sub-tasks. Finally, we instantiate OpenRS as reward supervision in pairwise RL training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自动化翻译和轻量过滤的方法，成功构建了适用于波兰语的视觉-语言模型（VLMs），在波兰语适配的MMBench上超越LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B达9.5%，并提升了生成字幕的语言正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型多基于英语数据训练，难以适应其他语言与文化场景，限制了非英语用户的使用及多元文化多模态系统的发展。

Method: 复现并适配LLaVA-Next方法，构建全自动翻译与过滤流水线处理多模态数据，并补充OCR与文化特异性任务的合成波兰语数据。

Result: 在波兰语MMBench上相对LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B提升9.5%；人工评估显示生成字幕语言正确性更高。

Conclusion: 大规模自动翻译结合轻量过滤可有效启动低资源语言高质量多模态模型的构建，但文化覆盖与评估仍存挑战。

Abstract: Most vision-language models (VLMs) are trained on English-centric data, limiting their performance in other languages and cultural contexts. This restricts their usability for non-English-speaking users and hinders the development of multimodal systems that reflect diverse linguistic and cultural realities. In this work, we reproduce and adapt the LLaVA-Next methodology to create a set of Polish VLMs. We rely on a fully automated pipeline for translating and filtering existing multimodal datasets, and complement this with synthetic Polish data for OCR and culturally specific tasks. Despite relying almost entirely on automatic translation and minimal manual intervention to the training data, our approach yields strong results: we observe a +9.5% improvement over LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B on a Polish-adapted MMBench, along with higher-quality captions in generative evaluations, as measured by human annotators in terms of linguistic correctness. These findings highlight that large-scale automated translation, combined with lightweight filtering, can effectively bootstrap high-quality multimodal models for low-resource languages. Some challenges remain, particularly in cultural coverage and evaluation. To facilitate further research, we make our models and evaluation dataset publicly available.

*Minghan Wang,Ye Bai,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Shareghi,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出高斯思维采样器（GTS），将潜推理中的推理时扩展（ITS）建模为可学习条件密度的采样，以替代启发式随机扰动，从而实现更结构化、可优化的探索机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ITS方法依赖启发式扰动（如dropout或固定高斯噪声），缺乏对探索行为的显式建模，且在有限采样预算下效率低；更强扰动未必带来更优轨迹，因无引导噪声易破坏决策结构。

Method: 将潜思维探索建模为从可学习密度中进行条件采样，提出高斯思维采样器（GTS），其预测上下文相关的连续推理状态扰动分布，并采用GRPO风格策略优化训练，同时冻结主干模型。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，GTS在两种潜推理架构上均展现出比启发式基线更可靠的推理时扩展性能。

Conclusion: 提升潜推理的ITS效果关键在于引入结构化、可优化的探索机制，而非简单增强随机性。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling (ITS) in latent reasoning models typically introduces stochasticity through heuristic perturbations, such as dropout or fixed Gaussian noise. While these methods increase trajectory diversity, their exploration behavior is not explicitly modeled and can be inefficient under finite sampling budgets. We observe that stronger perturbations do not necessarily translate into more effective candidate trajectories, as unguided noise may disrupt internal decision structure rather than steer it. To provide a more structured alternative, we model latent thought exploration as conditional sampling from learnable densities and instantiate this idea as a Gaussian Thought Sampler (GTS). GTS predicts context-dependent perturbation distributions over continuous reasoning states and is trained with GRPO-style policy optimization while keeping the backbone frozen. Experiments on GSM8K with two latent reasoning architectures show that GTS achieves more reliable inference-time scaling than heuristic baselines. These findings indicate that improving latent ITS requires structured and optimizable exploration mechanisms rather than simply amplifying stochasticity.

### [204] [Empty Shelves or Lost Keys? Recall Is the Bottleneck for Parametric Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14080)
*Nitay Calderon,Eyal Ben-David,Zorik Gekhman,Eran Ofek,Gal Yona*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种行为框架来剖析大语言模型（LLM）对事实知识的编码与可访问性，发现前沿模型已近乎饱和地编码事实，但回忆（recall）仍是主要瓶颈；许多错误源于无法访问已编码知识，而非知识缺失，并可通过推理时计算（'thinking'）显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的事实性评估将所有错误等同看待，无法区分是因知识缺失（空货架）还是知识已编码但难以访问（丢钥匙）所致，因此需要更细粒度的事实级知识剖析框架。

Method: 提出基于事实的行为分析框架，将每个事实按是否编码及可访问性（不可回忆、直接回忆、需推理时计算才能回忆）分类；构建自动化流水线生成的WikiProfile基准，结合提示的LLM与网络搜索进行数据构建。

Result: 在400万条来自13个LLM的响应中发现：GPT-5和Gemini-3对事实的编码率达95–98%，但回忆能力仍严重受限；回忆失败具有系统性，尤其影响长尾事实和反向问题；引入‘thinking’可显著恢复部分回忆失败。

Conclusion: 未来提升LLM事实性应更聚焦于改进模型对已有编码知识的利用方式（如推理机制），而非单纯依赖模型规模扩展。

Abstract: Standard factuality evaluations of LLMs treat all errors alike, obscuring whether failures arise from missing knowledge (empty shelves) or from limited access to encoded facts (lost keys). We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了CCiV基准，用于评估大语言模型在古典词诗生成中的结构、韵律和艺术质量三方面能力，并揭示了模型在变体识别、声调模式遵循及形式正确性与文学质量一致性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 古典词诗生成对大语言模型构成重大挑战，需系统评估其在结构、韵律与艺术质量上的综合能力。

Method: 构建CCiV基准，涵盖30种词牌，评估17个大语言模型；分析模型生成结果中的历史变体现象、声调遵循难度，并测试形式感知提示（form-aware prompting）的影响。

Result: 发现模型常生成有效但非预期的历史变体；声调模式遵循比结构规则更难；形式感知提示可提升强模型的结构与声调控制，却可能削弱弱模型表现；形式正确性与文学质量之间关联弱且不一致。

Conclusion: CCiV强调需发展变体感知型评估方法及更全面的约束性创意生成技术。

Abstract: The generation of classical Chinese \textit{Ci} poetry, a form demanding a sophisticated blend of structural rigidity, rhythmic harmony, and artistic quality, poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). To systematically evaluate and advance this capability, we introduce \textbf{C}hinese \textbf{Ci}pai \textbf{V}ariants (\textbf{CCiV}), a benchmark designed to assess LLM-generated \textit{Ci} poetry across these three dimensions: structure, rhythm, and quality. Our evaluation of 17 LLMs on 30 \textit{Cipai} reveals two critical phenomena: models frequently generate valid but unexpected historical variants of a poetic form, and adherence to tonal patterns is substantially harder than structural rules. We further show that form-aware prompting can improve structural and tonal control for stronger models, while potentially degrading weaker ones. Finally, we observe weak and inconsistent alignment between formal correctness and literary quality in our sample. CCiV highlights the need for variant-aware evaluation and more holistic constrained creative generation methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究神经网络是否能作为形态学习的认知模型，聚焦于西班牙语中L形形态现象，发现位置不变的位置编码模型能更好捕捉L形范式聚类，但所有模型均无法像人类一样将该模式泛化到新形式上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究神经网络能否像人类一样进行形态抽象，特别是对缺乏明显语音、语义或句法动因的L形形态模式（如西班牙语）的泛化能力。

Method: 比较五种编码器-解码器Transformer模型，区分序列型与位置不变型位置编码、原子型与分解型标签表示，并在西班牙语L形形态数据上进行训练与泛化测试。

Result: 位置不变的位置编码模型能较好恢复L形范式聚类，尤其在L形动词稀缺时；但所有模型均不能像人类那样将L形模式正确泛化至新形式——模型偏向跨语气（subjunctive）泛化，而人类则优先泛化至第一人称单数直陈式。

Conclusion: 当前神经网络可统计复现形态模式，但尚未实现真正的人类式形态抽象，揭示了统计学习与认知建模之间的关键差距。

Abstract: Whether neural networks can serve as cognitive models of morphological learning remains an open question. Recent work has shown that encoder-decoder models can acquire irregular patterns, but evidence that they generalize these patterns like humans is mixed. We investigate this using the Spanish \emph{L-shaped morphome}, where only the first-person singular indicative (e.g., \textit{pongo} `I put') shares its stem with all subjunctive forms (e.g., \textit{ponga, pongas}) despite lacking apparent phonological, semantic, or syntactic motivation. We compare five encoder-decoder transformers varying along two dimensions: sequential vs. position-invariant positional encoding, and atomic vs. decomposed tag representations. Positional encoding proves decisive: position-invariant models recover the correct L-shaped paradigm clustering even when L-shaped verbs are scarce in training, whereas sequential positional encoding models only partially capture the pattern. Yet none of the models productively generalize this pattern to novel forms. Position-invariant models generalize the L-shaped stem across subjunctive cells but fail to extend it to the first-person singular indicative, producing a mood-based generalization rather than the L-shaped morphomic pattern. Humans do the opposite, generalizing preferentially to the first-person singular indicative over subjunctive forms. None of the models reproduce the human pattern, highlighting the gap between statistical pattern reproduction and morphological abstraction.

TL;DR: 本文评估了四个最先进的大语言模型（Grok-4、GPT-4、Gemini 2.5 和 GPT-5）在长上下文任务中的性能，发现尽管模型理论上下文窗口极大，但在处理超过5K社交媒体帖子（70K tokens）时准确率显著下降至50–53%，而GPT-5在精度上仍保持约95%，凸显其在敏感应用（如抑郁检测）中的潜力；同时指出“中间丢失”问题在新模型中已基本解决，并强调需超越准确率、采用更全面的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在理论长上下文能力与实际长文本任务（尤其是需细节综合理解的任务）表现之间的差距。

Method: 在三个数据集（两个补充数据集：食谱与数学题检索；一个主数据集：20K条用于抑郁检测的社交媒体帖子）上评测Grok-4、GPT-4、Gemini 2.5和GPT-5四个SOTA模型的性能，重点分析不同输入规模（尤其≥5K帖子）下的准确率与精度变化，并考察‘丢失在中间’现象。

Result: 所有模型在输入超5K帖子（70K tokens）后准确率显著下降至50–53%（20K帖子时）；GPT-5虽准确率下降，但精度维持在约95%；‘丢失在中间’问题在新模型中已基本缓解。

Conclusion: 当前大模型的理论上下文容量与实际复杂高容量任务表现之间存在明显鸿沟；单一准确率不足以反映实用性能，应重视精度等多维指标，尤其在敏感应用场景中。

Abstract: With the significant expansion of the context window in Large Language Models (LLMs), these models are theoretically capable of processing millions of tokens in a single pass. However, research indicates a significant gap between this theoretical capacity and the practical ability of models to robustly utilize information within long contexts, especially in tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of numerous details. This paper evaluates the performance of four state-of-the-art models (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5) on long short-context tasks. For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts. Notably, in the GPT-5 model, despite the sharp decline in accuracy, its precision remained high at approximately 95%, a feature that could be highly effective for sensitive applications like depression detection. This research also indicates that the "lost in the middle" problem has been largely resolved in newer models. This study emphasizes the gap between the theoretical capacity and the actual performance of models on complex, high-volume data tasks and highlights the importance of metrics beyond simple accuracy for practical applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向科学主张验证的“弃权感知”框架，通过将主张分解为最小条件、利用自然语言推理（NLI）逐条审计证据，并支持“支持/反驳/弃权”三元决策，强调在证据不足时主动弃权比强行作答更可靠；实验表明弃权机制显著降低风险，且效果与模型架构无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型科学验证评估默认模型必须给出确定答案，但在科学场景中，缺乏依据的结论比主动弃权更具危害性。

Method: 构建弃权感知验证框架：将科学主张分解为最小可验证条件，对每个条件用自然语言推理（NLI）比对证据，再基于置信度选择支持、反驳或弃权。在SciFact和PubMedQA两个基准上，使用六类不同架构语言模型进行闭卷与开放域证据实验。

Result: 各模型原始准确率差异不大，但引入置信度驱动的弃权机制后，在中等覆盖率下显著降低错误风险；弃权能力成为控制误差的关键因素，且效果跨模型一致。

Conclusion: 科学推理的核心挑战不在于选择最优模型，而在于判断证据是否充分以支撑结论；弃权感知评估是一种实用、模型无关的科学可靠性评估新范式。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to answer and verify scientific claims, yet existing evaluations typically assume that a model must always produce a definitive answer. In scientific settings, however, unsupported or uncertain conclusions can be more harmful than abstaining. We study this problem through an abstention-aware verification framework that decomposes scientific claims into minimal conditions, audits each condition against available evidence using natural language inference (NLI), and selectively decides whether to support, refute, or abstain. We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error. In particular, confidence-based abstention substantially reduces risk at moderate coverage levels, even when absolute accuracy improvements are limited. Our results suggest that in scientific reasoning tasks, the primary challenge is not selecting a single best model, but rather determining when available evidence is sufficient to justify an answer. This work highlights abstention-aware evaluation as a practical and model-agnostic lens for assessing scientific reliability, and provides a unified experimental basis for future work on selective reasoning in scientific domains.

*Ghaly Hussein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel parsing approach that extends CFG and GPSG, generating both dependency and constituency trees while handling noise and incompleteness; it achieves ~54% UAS on Universal Dependencies data and supports interpretable, rerankable parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of context-free grammar (CFG) in syntactic parsing, especially for handling noise, incompleteness, and supporting both dependency and constituency representations.

Method: A new parsing algorithm combined with syntactically informed rules and features rooted in CFG and GPSG, designed to produce multiple parse hypotheses and accommodate noisy/incomplete input.

Result: Achieved average Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) of 54.5% on development (7 corpora) and 53.8% on test (12 corpora) sets from Universal Dependencies; supports multi-hypothesis output for reranking.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges decades of theoretical syntax with computational parsing, yielding a transparent, interpretable, and flexible NLP model.

Abstract: This research introduces a new parsing approach, based on earlier syntactic work on context free grammar (CFG) and generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG). The approach comprises both a new parsing algorithm and a set of syntactic rules and features that overcome the limitations of CFG. It also generates both dependency and constituency parse trees, while accommodating noise and incomplete parses. The system was tested on data from Universal Dependencies, showing a promising average Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) of 54.5% in the development dataset (7 corpora) and 53.8% in the test set (12 corpora). The system also provides multiple parse hypotheses, allowing further reranking to improve parsing accuracy. This approach also leverages much of the theoretical syntactic work since the 1950s to be used within a computational context. The application of this approach provides a transparent and interpretable NLP model to process language input.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于词嵌入簇结构几何特征的大语言模型幻觉分类法，识别出三类幻觉（中心漂移、错误收敛、覆盖缺口），并定义了三个可测量的几何统计量（α, η, λ_s），在11个模型上验证了其普适性与架构相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并系统分类大语言模型中的幻觉现象，特别是从嵌入空间的几何结构出发，以支持可解释、可检测的幻觉分析。

Method: 分析11个Transformer模型（含编码器与解码器）的静态词嵌入空间，基于token embedding簇的几何特性定义三类幻觉，并提出三个几何统计量（α, η, λ_s）进行量化验证。

Result: 发现极性结构（α > 0.5）和簇凝聚性（η > 0）在全部11个模型中普遍存在；径向信息梯度λ_s在9/11模型中显著（p < 0.05），ALBERT和MiniLM不显著的原因分别归因于嵌入因子分解压缩和蒸馏导致的各向同性。

Conclusion: 词嵌入空间具有普适几何结构，为按类型检测幻觉提供了理论基础，并可预测不同架构对各类幻觉的脆弱性。

Abstract: We propose a geometric taxonomy of large language model hallucinations based on observable signatures in token embedding cluster structure. By analyzing the static embedding spaces of 11 transformer models spanning encoder (BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, DeBERTa, ALBERT, MiniLM, DistilBERT) and decoder (GPT-2) architectures, we identify three operationally distinct hallucination types: Type 1 (center-drift) under weak context, Type 2 (wrong-well convergence) to locally coherent but contextually incorrect cluster regions, and Type 3 (coverage gaps) where no cluster structure exists. We introduce three measurable geometric statistics: α (polarity coupling), \b{eta} (cluster cohesion), and λ_s (radial information gradient). Across all 11 models, polarity structure (α > 0.5) is universal (11/11), cluster cohesion (\b{eta} > 0) is universal (11/11), and the radial information gradient is significant (9/11, p < 0.05). We demonstrate that the two models failing λ_s significance -- ALBERT and MiniLM -- do so for architecturally explicable reasons: factorized embedding compression and distillation-induced isotropy, respectively. These findings establish the geometric prerequisites for type-specific hallucination detection and yield testable predictions about architecture-dependent vulnerability profiles.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STATe-of-Thoughts（STATe）是一种可解释的推理时计算（ITC）方法，通过离散、可解释的文本干预（而非高温采样）控制推理过程，在提升输出多样性、质量与可解释性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ITC方法（如Best-of-N、Tree-of-Thoughts）依赖高温采样，导致输出多样性不足且推理过程缺乏可控性与可解释性。

Method: STATe构建三层结构：控制器选择编码高层推理策略的离散动作，生成器基于动作生成推理步骤，评估器对候选结果打分以指导搜索；全程使用可读文本干预替代随机采样。

Result: 实验表明：1）动作引导的干预显著提升响应多样性；2）在论点生成案例中，动作序列本身具有强质量预测性；3）可识别未探索但有潜力的动作子空间并定向引导生成。

Conclusion: STATe为生成高质量、多样化、可解释文本提供了一个实用、可控且可分析的新框架。

Abstract: Inference-Time-Compute (ITC) methods like Best-of-N and Tree-of-Thoughts are meant to produce output candidates that are both high-quality and diverse, but their use of high-temperature sampling often fails to achieve meaningful output diversity. Moreover, existing ITC methods offer limited control over how to perform reasoning, which in turn limits their explainability. We present STATe-of-Thoughts (STATe), an interpretable ITC method that searches over high-level reasoning patterns. STATe replaces stochastic sampling with discrete and interpretable textual interventions: a controller selects actions encoding high-level reasoning choices, a generator produces reasoning steps conditioned on those choices, and an evaluator scores candidates to guide search. This structured approach yields three main advantages. First, action-guided textual interventions produce greater response diversity than temperature-based sampling. Second, in a case study on argument generation, STATe's explicit action sequences capture interpretable features that are highly predictive of output quality. Third, estimating the association between performance and action choices allows us to identify promising yet unexplored regions of the action space and steer generation directly toward them. Together, these results establish STATe as a practical framework for generating high-quality, diverse, and interpretable text. Our framework is available at https://github.com/zbambergerNLP/state-of-thoughts.

TL;DR: 本文首次对AI代理社会（Moltbook）进行大规模系统性诊断，提出了一套量化动态演化分析框架，发现该社会虽在全局语义上快速稳定，但个体多样性高、词汇更替频繁、缺乏相互影响与共识形成能力，根源在于缺少共享社会记忆，表明仅靠规模和交互密度不足以催生真正的社会性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究AI代理社会是否像人类社会一样经历收敛动态，并理解其社会性形成的条件与机制。

Method: 构建量化诊断框架，测量语义稳定性、词汇更替率、个体惯性、影响力持久性及集体共识等维度，对Moltbook中AI代理社会进行大规模动态演化分析。

Result: Moltbook呈现动态平衡：全局语义快速稳定，但个体差异大、词汇持续更替；个体惯性强、几乎不因交互而改变，导致相互影响微弱、无持久超节点、无稳定集体影响力锚点。

Conclusion: 规模与交互密度本身不足以驱动AI代理社会化的出现；缺乏共享社会记忆是阻碍共识与稳定影响力结构形成的关键瓶颈，为下一代AI代理社会的设计与评估提供了关键原则。

Abstract: As large language model agents increasingly populate networked environments, a fundamental question arises: do artificial intelligence (AI) agent societies undergo convergence dynamics similar to human social systems? Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多令牌策略梯度优化（MPO）框架，将K个连续令牌视为统一的语义动作，以更好地捕捉复杂推理任务中的结构化语义，实验证明其在数学推理和编程任务上优于传统逐令牌策略梯度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于策略梯度的语言模型通常以单个token为动作单位，难以匹配复杂推理任务中语义决策常跨多个token（如定义变量、构建方程）的本质，造成优化粒度与推理结构不匹配。

Method: 提出Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization（MPO），将K个连续token作为一个语义动作单元进行策略梯度优化，实现块级建模与更高层次目标的联合优化。

Result: 在数学推理和编程基准测试中，MPO显著优于标准token级策略梯度基线方法。

Conclusion: token级策略梯度在复杂推理任务中存在固有局限，应转向更粗粒度（如块级）的动作空间设计，为推理密集型语言任务提供新方向。

Abstract: Existing policy-gradient methods for auto-regressive language models typically select subsequent tokens one at a time as actions in the policy. While effective for many generation tasks, such an approach may not fully capture the structure of complex reasoning tasks, where a single semantic decision is often realized across multiple tokens--for example, when defining variables or composing equations. This introduces a potential mismatch between token-level optimization and the inherently block-level nature of reasoning in these settings. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization (MPO), a framework that treats sequences of K consecutive tokens as unified semantic actions. This block-level perspective enables our method to capture the compositional structure of reasoning trajectories and supports optimization over coherent, higher-level objectives. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks show that MPO outperforms standard token-level policy gradient baselines, highlight the limitations of token-level policy gradients for complex reasoning, motivating future research to look beyond token-level granularity for reasoning-intensive language tasks.

Motivation: 现有公开资源多集中于Twitter、Reddit等主流平台，而alt-tech平台（如Truth Social）的对话结构研究不足，亟需构建专门数据集以支撑论证挖掘与立场检测研究。

Method: 构建TruthStance数据集（含回复树结构），开展人工标注（1,500例）并报告一致性指标；系统评估多种LLM提示策略，筛选最优配置后生成大规模LLM标注（24,352条帖子的论证存在性、107,873条评论对父帖的立场）。

Result: 发布首个面向Truth Social的大规模结构化对话数据集及配套人工与LLM标注；实证表明特定提示策略在论证与立场任务上表现最优；LLM标注支持跨深度、主题与用户的立场与论证模式分析。

Conclusion: TruthStance填补了alt-tech平台论证分析的数据空白，结合人工与LLM标注，为在线极端化、信息生态与立场极化研究提供了新基础资源与方法范式。

Abstract: Argument mining and stance detection are central to understanding how opinions are formed and contested in online discourse. However, most publicly available resources focus on mainstream platforms such as Twitter and Reddit, leaving conversational structure on alt-tech platforms comparatively under-studied. We introduce TruthStance, a large-scale dataset of Truth Social conversation threads spanning 2023-2025, consisting of 24,378 posts and 523,360 comments with reply-tree structure preserved. We provide a human-annotated benchmark of 1,500 instances across argument mining and claim-based stance detection, including inter-annotator agreement, and use it to evaluate large language model (LLM) prompting strategies. Using the best-performing configuration, we release additional LLM-generated labels for 24,352 posts (argument presence) and 107,873 comments (stance to parent), enabling analysis of stance and argumentation patterns across depth, topics, and users. All code and data are released publicly.

### [215] [WavePhaseNet: A DFT-Based Method for Constructing Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structures (SCHS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14419)
*Kiyotaka Kasubuchi,Kazuo Fukiya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过测度论和频域分析重构了大语言模型中的Transformer/Attention机制，指出幻觉是其结构固有缺陷；提出WavePhaseNet方法，利用离散傅里叶变换构建语义概念层级结构，并结合维度约简（24,576→3,000维）与上同调一致性控制，提升语义一致性并抑制幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型中幻觉问题的结构性根源，揭示嵌入空间与语义真值集之间非同构性导致的逻辑不一致。

Method: 融合测度论建模（嵌入空间作为σ-代数上的条件期望）、频域分解（DFT构建SCHS）、1/f谱分析驱动的维度约简、以及基于上同调与Hodge理论的一致性正则化（coboundary损失与调和投影）。

Result: 理论证明幻觉不可避免；实现24,576维到约3,000维的有效降维并保持语义完整性；通过上同调控制显著提升局部推理一致性与全局语义稳定性。

Conclusion: 幻觉源于嵌入空间结构与语义真值之间的根本失配；频域视角与拓扑正则化为构建更可靠、可解释、可推理的LLM提供了新范式。

Abstract: This paper reformulates Transformer/Attention mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) through measure theory and frequency analysis, theoretically demonstrating that hallucination is an inevitable structural limitation. The embedding space functions as a conditional expectation over a σ-algebra, and its failure to be isomorphic to the semantic truth set fundamentally causes logical consistency breakdown. WavePhaseNet Method The authors propose WavePhaseNet, which explicitly constructs a Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structure (SCHS) using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). By applying DFT along the sequence dimension, semantic information is decomposed into frequency bands: low-frequency components capture global meaning and intent, while high-frequency components represent local syntax and expression. This staged separation enables precise semantic manipulation in diagonalized space. Dimensionality Reduction GPT-4's 24,576-dimensional embedding space exhibits a 1/f spectral structure based on language self-similarity and Zipf's law. Through cumulative energy analysis, the authors derive that approximately 3,000 dimensions constitute the lower bound for "complete representation." This demonstrates that reduction from 24,576 to 3,000 dimensions preserves meaning and intent while enabling rigorous reasoning and suppressing hallucination. Cohomological Consistency Control The reduced embedding space, constructed via cohomological regularization over overlapping local windows, allows defining a graph structure and cochain complex. This quantifies inconsistencies among local inferences as coboundary-based losses. Applying harmonic projection based on Hodge theory positions cohomology as a computable regularization principle for controlling semantic consistency, extracting maximally consistent global representations.

### [216] [LLM-Guided Knowledge Distillation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14428)
*Wang Xing,Wei Song,Siyu Lin,Chen Wu,Man Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向时序知识图谱（TKG）推理的LLM辅助蒸馏框架，利用大语言模型作为辅助教师提供时序感知的丰富监督信号，提升轻量级学生模型的性能，同时保持低推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TKG模型计算开销大、部署成本高；传统压缩与蒸馏方法多针对静态图，难以建模时间依赖关系，直接迁移至时序场景易导致性能下降。

Method: 设计LLM辅助的蒸馏框架：除高容量时序教师模型外，引入大语言模型作为辅助教师，提供背景知识和时序信号；采用分阶段对齐策略联合优化监督与蒸馏目标。

Result: 在多个公开TKG基准和不同骨干架构上实验表明，该方法显著优于强蒸馏基线，在提升链接预测性能的同时保持学生模型轻量高效。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可作为有效的‘教师’，将时序推理能力高效迁移到资源受限的TKG系统中，为轻量化时序推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) support reasoning over time-evolving facts, yet state-of-the-art models are often computationally heavy and costly to deploy. Existing compression and distillation techniques are largely designed for static graphs; directly applying them to temporal settings may overlook time-dependent interactions and lead to performance degradation. We propose an LLM-assisted distillation framework specifically designed for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Beyond a conventional high-capacity temporal teacher, we incorporate a large language model as an auxiliary instructor to provide enriched supervision. The LLM supplies broad background knowledge and temporally informed signals, enabling a lightweight student to better model event dynamics without increasing inference-time complexity. Training is conducted by jointly optimizing supervised and distillation objectives, using a staged alignment strategy to progressively integrate guidance from both teachers. Extensive experiments on multiple public TKG benchmarks with diverse backbone architectures demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently improves link prediction performance over strong distillation baselines, while maintaining a compact and efficient student model. The results highlight the potential of large language models as effective teachers for transferring temporal reasoning capability to resource-efficient TKG systems.

### [217] [Robust Bias Evaluation with FilBBQ: A Filipino Bias Benchmark for Question-Answering Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14466)
*Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa,Yue Feng,Mark Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了FilBBQ，一个面向菲律宾语境、评估生成模型性别与恐同偏见的新基准，通过多阶段构建与改进的鲁棒评估协议（多种子响应平均）验证了菲律宾语模型存在显著且不稳定的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Bias Benchmark for Question-Answering（BBQ）的语言与文化适用性，填补针对菲律宾语及本土社会议题（如性别、性取向偏见）的偏见评估空白。

Method: 采用四阶段流程构建FilBBQ：模板分类、文化适配翻译、新模板构造和提示生成；对菲律宾语模型使用多随机种子采样响应并平均偏见得分，提升评估鲁棒性。

Result: 构建了超10,000条提示的FilBBQ基准；实证发现菲律宾语模型在情绪表达、家庭角色、刻板酷儿兴趣和一夫多妻制等维度存在显著且种子依赖的 sexist与homophobic偏见。

Conclusion: FilBBQ为低资源语言偏见评估提供了可复现、文化敏感的新范式，强调需结合多种子评估以应对生成模型响应不稳定性，并揭示了本地化偏见检测的必要性与复杂性。

Abstract: With natural language generation becoming a popular use case for language models, the Bias Benchmark for Question-Answering (BBQ) has grown to be an important benchmark format for evaluating stereotypical associations exhibited by generative models. We expand the linguistic scope of BBQ and construct FilBBQ through a four-phase development process consisting of template categorization, culturally aware translation, new template construction, and prompt generation. These processes resulted in a bias test composed of more than 10,000 prompts which assess whether models demonstrate sexist and homophobic prejudices relevant to the Philippine context. We then apply FilBBQ on models trained in Filipino but do so with a robust evaluation protocol that improves upon the reliability and accuracy of previous BBQ implementations. Specifically, we account for models' response instability by obtaining prompt responses across multiple seeds and averaging the bias scores calculated from these distinctly seeded runs. Our results confirm both the variability of bias scores across different seeds and the presence of sexist and homophobic biases relating to emotion, domesticity, stereotyped queer interests, and polygamy. FilBBQ is available via GitHub.

*Guangyue Peng,Zongchao Chen,Wen Luo,Yuntao Wen,Wei Li,Ruixiang Feng,Ran Le,Chen Yang,Zhenwei An,Yang Song,Tao Zhang,Houfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR)方法，以缓解逆向思维链生成（RCG）中因答案前置导致的认知锚定问题，并通过三层度量体系验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆向思维链生成（RCG）易产生事后合理化解释，因模型在生成推理路径时已知答案，导致答案成为认知锚点；现有语义抑制策略反而加剧深层锚定。

Method: 提出两阶段Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning（SSR）：先生成与答案无关的结构骨架，再据此引导完整推理链生成；并进一步提出蒸馏版SSR-D，用教师模型生成的SSR轨迹微调学生模型。

Result: SSR-D在多个开放推理基准上相较抑制基线提升最高达10%，且保持对分布外（OOD）样本的良好泛化能力；三层锚定指标（词汇、熵、概率）均显著下降。

Conclusion: 答案感知式推理生成存在根本性锚定偏差，而转向结构先行的规划范式（SSR）可有效解耦答案依赖；该思路为可控、可信推理生成提供了新路径。

Abstract: Reverse Chain-of-Thought Generation (RCG) synthesizes reasoning traces from query-answer pairs, but runs the risk of producing post-hoc rationalizations: when models can see the answer during generation, the answer serves as a cognitive anchor that shapes the entire explanation. We formalize this phenomenon through a three-level measurement hierarchy: lexical, entropic, and probabilistic anchoring, each captures surface artifacts, entropy dynamics, and latent answer dependence, respectively. We analyze semantic suppression, the intuitive mitigation strategy that instructs models to ignore the answer, to find out its counterproduction: while it reduces lexical overlap, it paradoxically increases entropic and probabilistic anchoring. Drawing on Ironic Process Theory from cognitive psychology, we attribute this failure to active monitoring of the forbidden answer, which inadvertently deepens dependence on it. To break this cycle, we propose Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR), a two-phase approach that first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton structure, then uses this skeleton to guide full trace generation. By redirecting the information flow to structural planning rather than answer monitoring, SSR consistently reduces anchoring across all three levels. We further introduce Distilled SSR (SSR-D), which fine-tunes models on teacher-generated SSR traces to ensure reliable structural adherence. Experiments across open-ended reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SSR-D achieves up to 10% improvement over suppression baselines while preserving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.

*Wen-Sheng Lien,Yu-Kai Chan,Hao-Lung Hsiao,Bo-Kai Ruan,Meng-Fen Chiang,Chien-An Chen,Yi-Ren Yeh,Hong-Han Shuai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出HyperRAG，一种面向n元超图的检索增强生成框架，包含HyperRetriever和HyperMemory两种互补检索变体，显著提升多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于二元知识图谱的图检索增强生成方法存在检索刚性、相似度搜索冗余、关系表达能力受限等问题；而n元超图能编码高阶关系、支持更高效浅层推理。

Method: 提出HyperRAG框架：(i) HyperRetriever通过学习n元事实上的结构-语义推理，构建查询条件化的关系链；(ii) HyperMemory利用大语言模型参数化记忆引导束搜索，动态评分并扩展查询感知路径。

Result: 在WikiTopics（11个闭域数据集）及HotpotQA、MuSiQue、2WikiMultiHopQA三个开域QA基准上验证有效；HyperRetriever整体答案准确率最高，在MRR和Hits@10上分别平均提升2.95%和1.23%。

Conclusion: HyperRAG通过n元超图建模与自适应、可解释的关系链构造，有效弥合多跳推理鸿沟，兼顾开域与闭域QA性能提升。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, typically built on knowledge graphs (KGs) with binary relational facts, have shown promise in multi-hop open-domain QA. However, their rigid retrieval schemes and dense similarity search often introduce irrelevant context, increase computational overhead, and limit relational expressiveness. In contrast, n-ary hypergraphs encode higher-order relational facts that capture richer inter-entity dependencies and enable shallower, more efficient reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose HyperRAG, a RAG framework tailored for n-ary hypergraphs with two complementary retrieval variants: (i) HyperRetriever learns structural-semantic reasoning over n-ary facts to construct query-conditioned relational chains. It enables accurate factual tracking, adaptive high-order traversal, and interpretable multi-hop reasoning under context constraints. (ii) HyperMemory leverages the LLM's parametric memory to guide beam search, dynamically scoring n-ary facts and entities for query-aware path expansion. Extensive evaluations on WikiTopics (11 closed-domain datasets) and three open-domain QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) validate HyperRAG's effectiveness. HyperRetriever achieves the highest answer accuracy overall, with average gains of 2.95% in MRR and 1.23% in Hits@10 over the strongest baseline. Qualitative analysis further shows that HyperRetriever bridges reasoning gaps through adaptive and interpretable n-ary chain construction, benefiting both open and closed-domain QA.

*Md. Najib Hasan,Mst. Jannatun Ferdous Rain,Fyad Mohammed,Nazmul Siddique*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多LLM协同的BETA标注框架，构建了高质量的孟加拉语IR数据集，并实证检验了跨语言数据集复用（经机器翻译）在低资源语言IR中的有效性与风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言信息检索（IR）受限于高质量、任务特定标注数据的稀缺；人工标注成本高、难扩展，而直接使用大语言模型（LLM）自动标注又存在标签可靠性、偏见和评估有效性等问题。

Method: 采用BETA标注框架：集成多个不同家族的LLM进行协同标注，引入上下文对齐、一致性校验和多数投票机制，并辅以人工评估验证标签质量；同时，通过多语言对的LLM驱动机器翻译，开展一跳跨语言数据集复用实验，评估语义保持度与任务有效性。

Result: BETA框架生成的孟加拉语IR数据集经人工验证具备较高质量；跨语言复用实验显示不同语言对间存在显著性能差异，反映语言依赖性偏差与语义失真问题，削弱了翻译后数据集的IR任务可靠性。

Conclusion: LLM辅助构建低资源IR数据集具有潜力，但需严谨的质量控制机制；跨语言数据集复用不可盲目套用，须结合语言特性评估语义保真度与任务适配性，本研究为低资源语言IR基准建设与评估流程提供了实证依据与实践指南。

Abstract: IR in low-resource languages remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality, task-specific annotated datasets. Manual annotation is expensive and difficult to scale, while using large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators introduces concerns about label reliability, bias, and evaluation validity. This work presents a Bangla IR dataset constructed using a BETA-labeling framework involving multiple LLM annotators from diverse model families. The framework incorporates contextual alignment, consistency checks, and majority agreement, followed by human evaluation to verify label quality. Beyond dataset creation, we examine whether IR datasets from other low-resource languages can be effectively reused through one-hop machine translation. Using LLM-based translation across multiple language pairs, we experimented on meaning preservation and task validity between source and translated datasets. Our experiment reveal substantial variation across languages, reflecting language-dependent biases and inconsistent semantic preservation that directly affect the reliability of cross-lingual dataset reuse. Overall, this study highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-assisted dataset creation for low-resource IR. It provides empirical evidence of the risks associated with cross-lingual dataset reuse and offers practical guidance for constructing more reliable benchmarks and evaluation pipelines in low-resource language settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在低资源语言（如僧伽罗语和泰米尔语）中是否具备真正的数学推理能力，还是依赖隐式翻译到英语。研究构建了三语平行数学问题数据集，涵盖六类数学任务，发现基础算术能力跨语言迁移良好，但复杂推理在僧伽罗语和泰米尔语中显著退化，表明当前多语言数学能力并非均匀分布，需更细粒度的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验LLMs在低资源语言（如僧伽罗语、泰米尔语）中是否具备真实数学推理能力，而非依赖隐式翻译；澄清多语言强表现是否等价于跨语言一致的推理能力。

Method: 构建由母语者兼数学训练者原生撰写的英-僧-泰三语平行数学问题数据集，覆盖六类数学问题；对四个主流LLM进行系统评测，并分析错误模式与模型/题型关联性。

Result: 基础算术推理跨语言鲁棒性强，但复杂推理（如单位冲突、优化）在僧伽罗语和泰米尔语中显著退化；失败模式因模型和问题类型而异，表明多语言数学能力不均一。

Conclusion: LLMs在低资源语言中的数学表现不能简单归因于真实推理，可能受翻译机制影响；多语言高性能不等于跨语言推理能力一致；亟需面向问题类型、细粒度的多语言评估范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning in English, but whether these capabilities reflect genuine multilingual reasoning or reliance on translation-based processing in low-resource languages like Sinhala and Tamil remains unclear. We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出XTF框架，通过分解token级数据对微调过程的贡献为推理重要性、知识新颖性和任务相关性三个属性，以过滤token级噪声，显著提升大语言模型在数学、代码和医学等下游任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微调数据集多为句子级设计，与LLM的token级优化机制存在根本性不匹配，引入token级噪声，影响最终性能。

Method: 提出XTF（可解释的token级噪声过滤框架），将token级数据贡献分解为推理重要性、知识新颖性和任务相关性三个可量化属性，并基于评分结果掩码噪声token的梯度。

Result: 在数学、代码和医学三大下游任务及7个主流LLM上实验表明，XTF相比常规微调最高可提升性能13.7%。

Conclusion: token级数据集优化至关重要，基于属性分解的策略有助于解释和优化复杂训练机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen remarkable advancements, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse applications. Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Wikidata Query Logs (WDQL)数据集，包含20万条基于真实Wikidata查询日志生成的自然语言问题-SPARQL查询对，并提出一种基于智能体的方法来去匿名化、清洗和验证查询，同时生成对应问题；该数据集显著大于现有同类数据集，且不依赖模板生成，已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wikidata问答数据集规模小且多依赖模板生成，缺乏真实查询多样性；真实日志查询因匿名化常无法执行，需有效方法恢复其语义并生成高质量问题。

Method: 提出一种迭代式智能体方法：对匿名化SPARQL日志查询进行去匿名化（如还原实体/属性ID）、清洗（修正语法错误）、验证（在Wikidata上执行并确保有结果），并同步生成对应的自然语言问题。

Result: 构建了含20万高质量问题-查询对的WDQL数据集，规模超现有最大同类数据集6倍以上；实验证明其能有效提升问答模型性能；所有数据与代码已开源。

Conclusion: WDQL是首个大规模、基于真实查询日志构建的Wikidata问答数据集，所提智能体方法解决了日志查询实用性低的关键问题，为知识图谱问答研究提供了高质量资源与新范式。

Abstract: We present the Wikidata Query Logs (WDQL) dataset, a dataset consisting of 200k question-query pairs over the Wikidata knowledge graph. It is over 6x larger than the largest existing Wikidata datasets of similar format without relying on template-generated queries. Instead, we construct it using real-world SPARQL queries sent to the Wikidata Query Service and generate questions for them. Since these log-based queries are anonymized, and therefore often do not produce results, a significant amount of effort is needed to convert them back into meaningful SPARQL queries. To achieve this, we present an agent-based method that iteratively de-anonymizes, cleans, and verifies queries against Wikidata while also generating corresponding natural-language questions. We demonstrate the dataset's benefit for training question-answering methods. All WDQL assets, as well as the agent code, are publicly available under a permissive license.

*Hao Liu,Guangyan Li,Wensheng Zhang,Yongqiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出GradMAP方法，通过基于梯度大小的新重要性度量和一步投影补偿机制，实现快速且高性能的LLM层剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层剪枝方法难以同时兼顾剪枝性能与效率，而LLM存在显著层冗余，亟需高效剪枝方案。

Method: GradMAP包含两阶段：第一阶段使用单次反向传播计算梯度幅值以全局评估层重要性；第二阶段识别均值偏移最大的层，并引入投影补偿矩阵进行一次性校正。

Result: 实验表明GradMAP在剪枝速度上平均提升4倍，同时性能优于先前方法。

Conclusion: GradMAP在保持模型性能的同时显著提升剪枝效率，为LLM轻量化部署提供了实用新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, but their high computational costs limit their practical deployment. Recent studies reveal significant redundancy in LLMs layers, making layer pruning an active research topic. Layer pruning research primarily focuses on two aspects: measuring layer importance and recovering performance after pruning. Unfortunately, the present works fail to simultaneously maintain pruning performance and efficiency. In this study, we propose GradMAP, a faster layer pruning method with \textbf{Grad}ient \textbf{M}etric \textbf{A}nd \textbf{P}rojection compensation, which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we introduce a novel metric based on gradient magnitudes, enabling a global assessment of layer importance. Note that, it requires only a single backward propagation step per pruning decision, substantially enhancing pruning efficiency. In the second stage, we first analyze the layers with the largest mean shift resulting from pruning, and then incorporate a simple yet effective projection compensation matrix to correct this drift in one step. In this way, the degradation of model performance caused by layer pruning is effectively alleviated. Extensive experiments show that GradMAP outperforms previous layer pruning methods in both pruning speed (achieving an average $4\times$ speedup) and performance.

### [226] [Is Information Density Uniform when Utterances are Grounded on Perception and Discourse?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14653)
*Matteo Gay,Coleman Haley,Mario Giulianelli,Edoardo Ponti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次在视觉情境下验证了均匀信息密度（UID）假说，利用多语言视觉-语言模型分析30种语言的图像描述和13种语言的视觉叙事数据，发现感知接地显著提升了信息分布的全局与局部均匀性，尤其在话语单元起始处效果最明显，支持了语境敏感的UID理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往UID假说研究仅基于纯文本，忽略了语言实际产生所依赖的感知情境；本文旨在探究视觉接地对信息密度分布的影响，推动UID理论向更生态化、多模态的语言使用场景拓展。

Method: 采用多语言视觉-语言模型，在30种语言的图像-文本配对数据和13种语言的视觉叙事数据（共覆盖11个语系）上估计词元级surprisal，量化比较视觉接地与纯文本条件下的信息密度均匀性（包括全局与局部指标）。

Result: 视觉接地一致增强了信息分布的全局和局部均匀性，且该效应跨语言类型稳健；在视觉叙事中，图像与话语双重上下文进一步降低surprisal，尤其在话语单元起始位置效果最强。

Conclusion: UID假说在视觉接地语境中依然成立，且表现出更强的信息均匀性，表明UID应被理解为一种受感知与话语上下文调节的动态、情境敏感机制，而非静态文本属性。

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis posits that speakers are subject to a communicative pressure to distribute information evenly within utterances, minimising surprisal variance. While this hypothesis has been tested empirically, prior studies are limited exclusively to text-only inputs, abstracting away from the perceptual context in which utterances are produced. In this work, we present the first computational study of UID in visually grounded settings. We estimate surprisal using multilingual vision-and-language models over image-caption data in 30 languages and visual storytelling data in 13 languages, together spanning 11 families. We find that grounding on perception consistently smooths the distribution of information, increasing both global and local uniformity across typologically diverse languages compared to text-only settings. In visual narratives, grounding in both image and discourse contexts has additional effects, with the strongest surprisal reductions occurring at the onset of discourse units. Overall, this study takes a first step towards modelling the temporal dynamics of information flow in ecologically plausible, multimodal language use, and finds that grounded language exhibits greater information uniformity, supporting a context-sensitive formulation of UID.

TL;DR: 本文提出FAL-AD框架，融合联邦学习与语音数据增强，解决阿尔茨海默病语音诊断中医疗数据稀缺与隐私限制导致的数据效率难题，在ADReSSo数据集上达到91.52%的多模态准确率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期诊断阿尔茨海默病（AD）至关重要，但AI语音检测面临医疗数据稀缺和隐私壁垒带来的数据效率困境。

Method: 提出FAL-AD框架，包含三部分：1）基于语音转换的数据增强，实现跨类别声学-内容重组；2）自适应联邦学习范式，支持多机构协作与隐私保护；3）带注意力机制的跨模态融合模型，实现词级对齐与声学-文本交互。

Result: 在ADReSSo数据集上取得91.52%的多模态分类准确率，超越所有中心化基线方法。

Conclusion: FAL-AD为AD语音辅助诊断提供了一种兼顾数据效率、隐私保护与模型性能的实用化解决方案。

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is crucial for delaying its progression. While AI-based speech detection is non-invasive and cost-effective, it faces a critical data efficiency dilemma due to medical data scarcity and privacy barriers. Therefore, we propose FAL-AD, a novel framework that synergistically integrates federated learning with data augmentation to systematically optimize data efficiency. Our approach delivers three key breakthroughs: First, absolute efficiency improvement through voice conversion-based augmentation, which generates diverse pathological speech samples via cross-category voice-content recombination. Second, collaborative efficiency breakthrough via an adaptive federated learning paradigm, maximizing cross-institutional benefits under privacy constraints. Finally, representational efficiency optimization by an attentive cross-modal fusion model, which achieves fine-grained word-level alignment and acoustic-textual interaction. Evaluated on ADReSSo, FAL-AD achieves a state-of-the-art multi-modal accuracy of 91.52%, outperforming all centralized baselines and demonstrating a practical solution to the data efficiency dilemma.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个皮埃蒙特语的众包数据集，包含145个意大利语-皮埃蒙特语平行句对，并基于该数据集对多个大语言模型在分词一致性、主题分类和机器翻译任务上的表现进行了基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为濒危语言皮埃蒙特语构建高质量、反映真实书写习惯的平行语料资源，并评估大语言模型对其的支持能力。

Method: 构建含手动词对齐的意大利语-皮埃蒙特语平行句对数据集（源自Flores+），采用母语者自然拼写风格；在tokenization parity、topic classification和machine translation三项任务上对多个LLM进行评测。

Result: 皮埃蒙特语存在明显分词惩罚；主题分类性能接近意大利语、法语和英语；机器翻译呈不对称性：从皮埃蒙特语译出效果尚可，但译入皮埃蒙特语效果差。

Conclusion: 当前LLM对濒危语言皮埃蒙特语的支持仍不均衡，需针对性改进分词与生成能力；该数据集和代码已开源，有助于推动低资源语言NLP研究。

Abstract: We present a crowdsourced dataset for Piedmontese, an endangered Romance language of northwestern Italy. The dataset comprises 145 Italian-Piedmontese parallel sentences derived from Flores+, with translations produced by speakers writing in their natural orthographic style rather than adhering to standardized conventions, along with manual word alignment. We use this resource to benchmark several large language models on tokenization parity, topic classification, and machine translation. Our analysis reveals that Piedmontese incurs a tokenization penalty relative to higher-resource Romance languages, yet LLMs achieve classification performance approaching that of Italian, French, and English. Machine translation results are asymmetric: models translate adequately from Piedmontese into high-resource languages, but generation into Piedmontese remains challenging. The dataset and code are publicly released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLMStructBench，一个用于评估大语言模型从自然语言文本中提取结构化数据并生成有效JSON输出的新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏系统性评估LLM在结构化数据提取与JSON生成任务上的能力，尤其缺少兼顾语法正确性与语义准确性的综合评测基准。

Method: 构建了一个包含多样化、人工验证解析场景的开源数据集；设计了覆盖22个模型和5种提示策略的系统性评测框架；提出兼顾token级准确率与文档级有效性的新型评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，提示策略的选择比模型规模对解析可靠性影响更大；恰当的提示能显著提升小模型的结构有效性，但可能增加语义错误；该基准为LLM在ETL等结构化任务中的应用研究提供了基础支持。

Conclusion: LLMStructBench为评估LLM在结构化数据解析任务中的性能提供了标准化、可复现的基准，强调提示工程的关键作用，并推动LLM在ETL等实际数据处理场景中的落地。

Abstract: We present LLMStructBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on extracting structured data and generating valid JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) outputs from natural-language text. Our open dataset comprises diverse, manually verified parsing scenarios of varying complexity and enables systematic testing across 22 models and five prompting strategies. We further introduce complementary performance metrics that capture both token-level accuracy and document-level validity, facilitating rigorous comparison of model, size, and prompting effects on parsing reliability.
  In particular, we show that choosing the right prompting strategy is more important than standard attributes such as model size. This especially ensures structural validity for smaller or less reliable models but increase the number of semantic errors. Our benchmark suite is an step towards future research in the area of LLM applied to parsing or Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模实证研究（80亿观测数据、17种预测场景等）证明，大语言模型（LLMs）在时间序列预测（TSF）中确实有效，尤其在跨域泛化任务中显著提升性能；预对齐优于后对齐；预训练知识与模型架构互补；大规模混合分布下完整LLM不可替代。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究质疑LLM在时间序列预测中的实际价值，常因评估范围有限而得出负面结论，亟需系统性、大规模验证。

Method: 开展覆盖80亿观测、17种场景、4种预测步长、多种对齐策略及域内/域外设置的大规模实证研究，并结合token级路由分析和prompt优化进行机制探究。

Result: LLM4TSF显著提升预测性能，尤其在跨域泛化上增益明显；预对齐在90%以上任务中优于后对齐；预训练知识与模型架构互补：前者应对分布偏移关键，后者擅长建模复杂时序动态；大规模混合分布下完整LLM不可或缺。

Conclusion: 推翻此前对LLM用于TSF的消极判断，明确了LLM有效的关键条件（如跨域、大规模混合分布、预对齐），并为LLM4TSF模型设计提供实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced to time series forecasting (TSF) to incorporate contextual knowledge beyond numerical signals. However, existing studies question whether LLMs provide genuine benefits, often reporting comparable performance without LLMs. We show that such conclusions stem from limited evaluation settings and do not hold at scale. We conduct a large-scale study of LLM-based TSF (LLM4TSF) across 8 billion observations, 17 forecasting scenarios, 4 horizons, multiple alignment strategies, and both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our results demonstrate that \emph{LLM4TS indeed improves forecasting performance}, with especially large gains in cross-domain generalization. Pre-alignment outperforming post-alignment in over 90\% of tasks. Both pretrained knowledge and model architecture of LLMs contribute and play complementary roles: pretraining is critical under distribution shifts, while architecture excels at modeling complex temporal dynamics. Moreover, under large-scale mixed distributions, a fully intact LLM becomes indispensable, as confirmed by token-level routing analysis and prompt-based improvements. Overall, Our findings overturn prior negative assessments, establish clear conditions under which LLMs are not only useful, and provide practical guidance for effective model design. We release our code at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLM4TSF.

*Francesco Gariboldi,Emma Franchino,Edith Haim,Gianluca Lattanzi,Alessandro Grecucci,Massimo Stella*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用认知网络科学构建行为形式心智网络（BFMN），分析不同群体（中学生、大学生、早期STEM专家）及GPT-oss“数字孪生”对STEM相关概念的态度，发现科学与研究普遍呈积极框架，而数学与统计则呈现更消极、焦虑相关的语义氛围，尤其在高数学焦虑群体中更显著；人类网络比LLM更凸显数学与焦虑的关联，表明LLM难以捕捉经验驱动的教育焦虑特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究STEM态度如何由知识、教育经历与情感交互形成，并评估大语言模型能否真实模拟人类在STEM领域的认知-情感心态。

Method: 基于自由联想数据构建行为形式心智网络（BFMN），以词为节点、实证联想为边、情感效价为标注；分析围绕关键概念（如STEM学科、教育主体/场所）的语义邻域（'框架'），量化其效价光环、情绪谱、网络重叠度（Jaccard相似性）和具体性；对比真实人群（N=994）与GPT-oss数字孪生的表现。

Result: 科学与研究被一致正向框架化；数学与统计呈现更强负向与焦虑相关效价，且在高数学焦虑亚组中加剧；高焦虑框架更抽象、去情境化；人类网络中数学与焦虑的关联强于GPT-oss。

Conclusion: BFMN能有效刻画STEM领域中的认知-情感心态特征；LLM可近似文化层面态度，但无法复现依赖个体经验与情境的教育焦虑等深层心理成分。

Abstract: Attitudes toward STEM develop from the interaction of conceptual knowledge, educational experiences, and affect. Here we use cognitive network science to reconstruct group mindsets as behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs). In this case, nodes are cue words and free associations, edges are empirical associative links, and each concept is annotated with perceived valence. We analyse BFMNs from N = 994 observations spanning high school students, university students, and early-career STEM experts, alongside LLM (GPT-oss) "digital twins" prompted to emulate comparable profiles. Focusing also on semantic neighbourhoods ("frames") around key target concepts (e.g., STEM subjects or educational actors/places), we quantify frames in terms of valence auras, emotional profiles, network overlap (Jaccard similarity), and concreteness relative to null baselines. Across student groups, science and research are consistently framed positively, while their core quantitative subjects (mathematics and statistics) exhibit more negative and anxiety related auras, amplified in higher math-anxiety subgroups, evidencing a STEM-science cognitive and emotional dissonance. High-anxiety frames are also less concrete than chance, suggesting more abstract and decontextualised representations of threatening quantitative domains. Human networks show greater overlapping between mathematics and anxiety than GPT-oss. The results highlight how BFMNs capture cognitive-affective signatures of mindsets towards the target domains and indicate that LLM-based digital twins approximate cultural attitudes but miss key context-sensitive, experience-based components relevant to replicate human educational anxiety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现大语言模型中存在输入-输出对齐偏移问题，并提出了一种基于残差衰减的轻量级缓解方法，有效提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型使用自回归Transformer进行训练，其残差连接将激活与当前token绑定，而监督信号却针对下一个token，导致潜在的信息错配。

Method: 通过解码轨迹和基于相似度的指标，在预训练LLM中定位输入-输出对齐偏移；提出基于残差衰减的轻量级残差路径缓解策略，包括固定层干预和可学习门控机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试上验证了所提方法能缓解表征错对齐问题并带来性能提升。

Conclusion: 输入-输出对齐偏移是自回归Transformer中的一个关键问题，所提出的残差衰减方法是一种高效且通用的架构增强手段。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with next-token prediction, implemented in autoregressive Transformers via causal masking for parallelism. This creates a subtle misalignment: residual connections tie activations to the current token, while supervision targets the next token, potentially propagating mismatched information if the current token is not the most informative for prediction. In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that these strategies alleviate the representation misalignment and yield improvements, providing an efficient and general architectural enhancement for autoregressive Transformers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了推理导向的大语言模型（RLMs）在机器翻译（MT）任务中的应用效果，发现直接启用显式推理会降低翻译质量；分析表明MT中的推理轨迹线性化严重、缺乏自我修正与多路径探索；为此，作者提出一种面向翻译的结构化多步推理框架，并构建合成数据进行后训练，显著提升了翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理导向大语言模型（RLMs）在数学和编程等任务中表现优异，但在机器翻译（MT）中的作用尚不明确，亟需系统评估与适配。

Method: 在WMT24++基准上系统评测多种开源与闭源RLMs；分析其推理轨迹特性；提出面向MT的结构化推理框架（含多步起草、充分性优化、流利性提升与选择性迭代修订）；构建动态结构化推理合成数据集，并对大型推理模型进行后训练。

Result: 启用通用显式推理会一致降低MT质量；MT推理轨迹呈高度线性、缺乏修订与探索；注入高质量推理无法稳定提升弱模型性能；所提结构化推理框架结合后训练，在多个指标上显著优于标准微调与通用推理注入基线。

Conclusion: 通用推理机制不适用于机器翻译，必须设计任务定制化的结构化推理流程，才能有效提升翻译性能。

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented large language models (RLMs) achieve strong gains on tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating explicit intermediate reasoning. However, their impact on machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate several open- and closed-weights RLMs on the WMT24++ benchmark and find that enabling explicit reasoning consistently degrades translation quality across languages and models. Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision. We curate a synthetic dataset of dynamic structured reasoning traces and post-train a large reasoning model on this data. Experiments show significant improvements over standard translation fine-tuning and injected generic reasoning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning must be task-structured to benefit MT.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在线社区讨论对LLM创作单口喜剧的影响，通过多智能体沙盒实验发现，引入经过过滤和存储的批评与观众讨论作为社会记忆，能显著提升喜剧稿件在专业评审中的表现，尤其在技巧/清晰度和社会响应方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注提示词和局部反馈对大语言模型写作的影响，而忽视了线上社区中持续的公众反响如何影响创作质量。

Method: 设计了一个受控的多智能体沙盒实验：在‘讨论条件’下，记录、过滤并存储批评者与观众的线程作为社会记忆，并用于后续生成；基线条件则不引入该讨论机制；共进行50轮（250组配对独白），由五位专家评审员采用A/B偏好测试和15项量表评估。

Result: 讨论条件在75.6%的对比中胜出；Craft/Clarity提升Δ=0.440，Social Response提升Δ=0.422；偶见攻击性幽默增加。

Conclusion: 广播式社区讨论可有效增强LLM在创意写作（如单口喜剧）中的表现，验证了社会记忆作为反馈机制的价值，但也需警惕其对幽默风格的潜在副作用。

Abstract: Prior work has explored multi-turn interaction and feedback for LLM writing, but evaluations still largely center on prompts and localized feedback, leaving persistent public reception in online communities underexamined. We test whether broadcast community discussion improves stand-up comedy writing in a controlled multi-agent sandbox: in the discussion condition, critic and audience threads are recorded, filtered, stored as social memory, and later retrieved to condition subsequent generations, whereas the baseline omits discussion. Across 50 rounds (250 paired monologues) judged by five expert annotators using A/B preference and a 15-item rubric, discussion wins 75.6% of instances and improves Craft/Clarity (Δ = 0.440) and Social Response (Δ = 0.422), with occasional increases in aggressive humor.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在经历‘涌现错对齐’（emergent misalignment）及其逆转过程中的行为自我意识（behavioral self-awareness），发现模型能自发评估自身有害性变化，从而反映其真实对齐状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究'涌现错对齐'与'行为自我意识'两个现象的交叉：即模型是否能在不依赖上下文示例的情况下，自发感知并报告自身对齐状态的变化。

Method: 对GPT-4.1模型进行序列微调，依次使用诱导错对齐和恢复对齐的数据集，并在无上下文示例条件下评估模型对其自身有害性的自我评分。

Result: 涌现错对齐模型显著自评为更高有害性，而基线模型与重对齐模型评分较低；表明模型具备跟踪自身对齐状态的行为自我意识。

Conclusion: 行为自我意识可作为模型安全性的可查询指标，为无需外部监督即可监测模型对齐状态提供了新路径。

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on incorrect trivia question-answer pairs exhibit toxicity - a phenomenon later termed "emergent misalignment". Moreover, research has shown that LLMs possess behavioral self-awareness - the ability to describe learned behaviors that were only implicitly demonstrated in training data. Here, we investigate the intersection of these phenomena. We fine-tune GPT-4.1 models sequentially on datasets known to induce and reverse emergent misalignment and evaluate whether the models are self-aware of their behavior transitions without providing in-context examples. Our results show that emergently misaligned models rate themselves as significantly more harmful compared to their base model and realigned counterparts, demonstrating behavioral self-awareness of their own emergent misalignment. Our findings show that behavioral self-awareness tracks actual alignment states of models, indicating that models can be queried for informative signals about their own safety.

TL;DR: 本文从几何视角研究小规模语言模型中的幻觉现象，发现真实响应在嵌入空间中更紧密聚类，并据此提出一种仅需30-50个标注即可高效分类大量响应的标签传播方法，F1得分超90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉（即流利但事实错误的响应）严重损害语言模型可靠性，尤其在多步或智能体场景中；现有评估范式多聚焦知识层面或单响应分析，缺乏对响应间结构关系的建模。

Method: 基于‘真实响应在嵌入空间中聚类更紧’的假设，进行理论证明；利用该几何特性实现响应间的稳定可分性，并设计标签高效的传播算法进行批量响应分类。

Result: 证实了真实响应在嵌入空间中具有更紧凑的几何结构；实现了高可分性；所提方法仅用30–50个标注即可达>90% F1分数。

Conclusion: 将幻觉建模为嵌入空间中的几何结构问题，为幻觉检测提供了新范式，补充了传统知识驱动与单响应评估方法，推动后续研究。

Abstract: Hallucinations -- fluent but factually incorrect responses -- pose a major challenge to the reliability of language models, especially in multi-step or agentic settings.
  This work investigates hallucinations in small-sized LLMs through a geometric perspective, starting from the hypothesis that when models generate multiple responses to the same prompt, genuine ones exhibit tighter clustering in the embedding space, we prove this hypothesis and, leveraging this geometrical insight, we also show that it is possible to achieve a consistent level of separability. This latter result is used to introduce a label-efficient propagation method that classifies large collections of responses from just 30-50 annotations, achieving F1 scores above 90%.
  Our findings, framing hallucinations from a geometric perspective in the embedding space, complement traditional knowledge-centric and single-response evaluation paradigms, paving the way for further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文揭示了工具使用型大语言模型代理中存在的供应链攻击面，即恶意MCP工具服务器可通过注册恶意工具诱导模型产生结构性过度思考循环，从而显著增加token消耗和延迟，且现有解码时简洁性控制无法可靠防御此类攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具使用型LLM代理依赖工具元数据进行工具选择与编排，这种便利性带来了供应链攻击风险，特别是恶意工具可能引发难以检测的过度思考循环。

Method: 形式化定义结构性过度思考攻击，构建14个跨3个服务器的恶意工具，覆盖重复、强制精炼和干扰三类行为，并在多种工具注册中心和模型上进行实证评估。

Result: 攻击导致最高达142.4倍的token放大，损害任务效果；解码时简洁性控制无法可靠阻止循环生成。

Conclusion: 防御应聚焦于工具调用结构层面的推理，而非仅控制token数量。

Abstract: Tool-using LLM agents increasingly coordinate real workloads by selecting and chaining third-party tools based on text-visible metadata such as tool names, descriptions, and return messages. We show that this convenience creates a supply-chain attack surface: a malicious MCP tool server can be co-registered alongside normal tools and induce overthinking loops, where individually trivial or plausible tool calls compose into cyclic trajectories that inflate end-to-end tokens and latency without any single step looking abnormal. We formalize this as a structural overthinking attack, distinguishable from token-level verbosity, and implement 14 malicious tools across three servers that trigger repetition, forced refinement, and distraction. Across heterogeneous registries and multiple tool-capable models, the attack causes severe resource amplification (up to $142.4\times$ tokens) and can degrade task outcomes. Finally, we find that decoding-time concision controls do not reliably prevent loop induction, suggesting defenses should reason about tool-call structure rather than tokens alone.

Motivation: 现有研究未关注大语言模型在低资源语言（如巴斯克语）中非问答式物理常识推理任务上的表现，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于意大利语GITA数据集构建巴斯克语物理常识推理数据集BasPhyCo（含标准与方言两种版本），并在三个递进层次（合理性、一致性、可验证性）上对多种多语言及特定语言预训练模型进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，大语言模型在巴斯克语（尤其是方言变体）的物理常识推理任务（特别是可验证性层面）上能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前多语言大模型在低资源语言及其方言中的物理常识推理能力仍显著不足，亟需针对性的数据与建模方法提升。

Abstract: Physical commonsense reasoning represents a fundamental capability of human intelligence, enabling individuals to understand their environment, predict future events, and navigate physical spaces. Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在长推理链任务中表现优异，但存在计算成本高、输出冗长（即'过度思考'）的问题，尤其在GRPO/DAPO等RL训练下更严重。

Method: 提出BFS-PO强化学习算法，采用基于最大熵节点的回溯式最佳优先搜索策略，在训练中逐步生成更短的正确响应，从而学习生成简洁推理链。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown excellent performance in reasoning tasks using long reasoning chains. However, this has also led to a significant increase of computational costs and the generation of verbose output, a phenomenon known as overthinking. The tendency to overthinking is often exacerbated by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms such as GRPO/DAPO. In this paper, we propose BFS-PO, an RL algorithm which alleviates this problem using a Best-First Search exploration strategy. Specifically, BFS-PO looks for the shortest correct answer using a backtracking mechanism based on maximum entropy nodes. By generating progressively shorter responses during training, BFS-PO learns to produce concise reasoning chains. Using different benchmarks and base LRMs, we show that BFS-PO can simultaneously increase the LRM accuracy and shorten its answers.

### [241] [Tool-Aware Planning in Contact Center AI: Evaluating LLMs through Lineage-Guided Query Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14955)
*Varun Nathan,Shreyas Guha,Ayush Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向联络中心业务洞察查询的工具感知规划生成框架与基准，包含评估框架、数据构建方法和大规模LLM规划能力评测，揭示了当前大模型在多步、复合查询及工具对齐上的显著短板。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联络中心中业务洞察查询需调用结构化（如Text2SQL）与非结构化（如RAG）工具协同完成，但现有LLM缺乏可靠、可执行、可并行的分步规划能力，亟需系统性评估与提升方法。

Method: 构建域适配的工具感知规划生成框架：（i）双模态参考式评估框架（七维指标评估+单次匹配评估）；（ii）基于评估器-优化器迭代的数据精炼方法，生成高质量规划谱系；（iii）在带/不带谱系提示下，对14个LLM进行大规模规划能力评测。

Result: LLM在复合查询和超4步规划上表现差；最优总分84.8%（Claude-3-7-Sonnet），最优单次匹配率仅49.75%（o3-mini）；规划谱系带来有限但有针对性的提升，尤其增强步骤可执行性；短而简单的规划显著更易成功。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在工具理解（特别是工具-提示对齐与工具使用完整性）上存在根本性缺陷；所提框架为联络中心场景下数据查询的具身规划能力评估与改进提供了可复现路径。

Abstract: We present a domain-grounded framework and benchmark for tool-aware plan generation in contact centers, where answering a query for business insights, our target use case, requires decomposing it into executable steps over structured tools (Text2SQL (T2S)/Snowflake) and unstructured tools (RAG/transcripts) with explicit depends_on for parallelism. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reference-based plan evaluation framework operating in two modes - a metric-wise evaluator spanning seven dimensions (e.g., tool-prompt alignment, query adherence) and a one-shot evaluator; (ii) a data curation methodology that iteratively refines plans via an evaluator->optimizer loop to produce high-quality plan lineages (ordered plan revisions) while reducing manual effort; and (iii) a large-scale study of 14 LLMs across sizes and families for their ability to decompose queries into step-by-step, executable, and tool-assigned plans, evaluated under prompts with and without lineage. Empirically, LLMs struggle on compound queries and on plans exceeding 4 steps (typically 5-15); the best total metric score reaches 84.8% (Claude-3-7-Sonnet), while the strongest one-shot match rate at the "A+" tier (Extremely Good, Very Good) is only 49.75% (o3-mini). Plan lineage yields mixed gains overall but benefits several top models and improves step executability for many. Our results highlight persistent gaps in tool-understanding, especially in tool-prompt alignment and tool-usage completeness, and show that shorter, simpler plans are markedly easier. The framework and findings provide a reproducible path for assessing and improving agentic planning with tools for answering data-analysis queries in contact-center settings.

TL;DR: 本文评估了18个大语言模型在客服质检中的反事实公平性，发现存在系统性偏差，尤其受历史表现提示和隐含身份线索影响，并指出需建立标准化公平性审计流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）被广泛用于客服质检，但其基于网络规模数据训练可能引入人口统计与行为偏差，影响员工评估的公平性。

Method: 提出基于13个维度（身份、上下文、行为风格）的反事实公平性评估框架，使用反事实翻转率（CFR）和平均绝对得分差（MASD）量化不公平性，并在3000条真实客服对话上测试18个LLM。

Result: CFR介于5.4%–13.0%，部分场景达16.4%；MASD在信心、正面及改进建议得分上均显著；强对齐大模型更公平，但公平性不随准确率提升；显式公平提示仅带来有限改善。

Conclusion: LLM在高风险人力评估中存在不可忽视的系统性不公平，亟需部署前开展标准化公平性审计。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in contact-center Quality Assurance (QA) to automate agent performance evaluation and coaching feedback. While LLMs offer unprecedented scalability and speed, their reliance on web-scale training data raises concerns regarding demographic and behavioral biases that may distort workforce assessment. We present a counterfactual fairness evaluation of LLM-based QA systems across 13 dimensions spanning three categories: Identity, Context, and Behavioral Style. Fairness is quantified using the Counterfactual Flip Rate (CFR), the frequency of binary judgment reversals, and the Mean Absolute Score Difference (MASD), the average shift in coaching or confidence scores across counterfactual pairs. Evaluating 18 LLMs on 3,000 real-world contact center transcripts, we find systematic disparities, with CFR ranging from 5.4% to 13.0% and consistent MASD shifts across confidence, positive, and improvement scores. Larger, more strongly aligned models show lower unfairness, though fairness does not track accuracy. Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency. Our findings underscore the need for standardized fairness auditing pipelines prior to deploying LLMs in high-stakes workforce evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Pep框架，通过离线学习偏好相关性结构、在线贝叶斯推理实现高效冷启动个性化偏好获取，显著优于强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动个性化面临路由难题：用户仅关心众多偏好维度中的少数几个，且关键维度因人而异；有限提问次数下需结构化提问策略，而传统强化学习无法有效利用偏好数据的因子化结构。

Method: 将冷启动偏好获取分解为离线结构学习（从完整用户画像中学习偏好相关性）和在线贝叶斯推理（无需训练，动态选择信息量大的问题并预测完整偏好轮廓）。

Result: 在多个领域测试中，Pep相比RL方法达到80.8% vs 68.5%的偏好对齐率，交互次数减少3-5倍；面对相同问题的不同用户反馈，Pep调整后续提问的概率达39-62%，远高于RL的0-28%；参数量仅约10K，远小于RL的8B。

Conclusion: 冷启动偏好获取的关键瓶颈在于能否有效利用偏好数据的因子化结构，而非模型规模；Pep通过模块化设计和简单信念模型，实现了高效、可解释、低资源消耗的个性化冷启动。

Abstract: Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型参数高效微调的文本风格迁移新方法，利用回译技术从单语语料中构建平行数据，并引入RAG增强术语和名称知识，显著提升了风格准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本风格迁移任务中平行语料稀缺的问题，尤其是缺乏明确风格映射的训练数据。

Method: 采用回译（roundtrip translation）技术从单语语料合成平行风格数据，构建‘中立化’文本作为共享输入风格；结合参数高效微调LLM与检索增强生成（RAG）以注入术语和名称知识。

Result: 在四个领域上，该方法在BLEU分数和风格准确率上均持续优于零样本提示和少样本上下文学习（ICL）。

Conclusion: 基于中立化回译与RAG增强的参数高效微调策略，是提升文本风格迁移性能与鲁棒性的有效范式。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for Text Style Transfer (TST) based on parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Addressing the scarcity of parallel corpora that map between styles, the study employs roundtrip translation to synthesize such parallel datasets from monolingual corpora. This approach creates 'neutralized' text devoid of stylistic attributes, essentially creating a shared input style at training-time and inference-time. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority of this method over zero-shot prompting and fewshot ICL techniques measured by BLEU scores and style accuracy scores across four investigated domains. Furthermore, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for terminology and name knowledge enhances robustness and stylistic consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with agentic web search capabilities show strong potential for tasks requiring real-time information access and complex fact retrieval, yet evaluating such systems remains challenging. We introduce \bench, a rigorous and regularly updated benchmark designed to assess the agentic web search abilities of LLMs. \bench automatically generates fresh question-answer pairs from recent news articles, ensuring that questions require information beyond an LLM's training data and enabling clear separation between internal knowledge and search capability. The benchmark features intentionally difficult questions requiring multi-hop search queries, page visits, and reasoning, making it well-suited for evaluating agentic search behavior. Our automated data curation and question generation pipeline enables frequent benchmark updates and supports construction of a large-scale training dataset for agentic web search models, addressing the scarcity of such data in the research community. To ensure reliable evaluation, we include a subset of human-verified samples in the test set. We evaluate a broad range of systems using \bench, including commercial and open-weight LLMs as well as LLM-based web search APIs. The leaderboard, datasets, and code are publicly available at livenewsbench.com.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出ACERec框架，通过解耦细粒度分词与高效序列建模之间的粒度差距，在保持语义表达力的同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于残差量化（RQ）和优化乘积量化（OPQ）的方法在语义ID生成推荐中难以兼顾表达力与效率：RQ限制ID长度牺牲表达力，OPQ粗暴聚合又丢失细粒度语义。

Method: ACERec采用Attentive Token Merger将长而富有表达力的语义token蒸馏为紧凑隐表示，并引入动态意图token作为预测锚点；通过细粒度token预测与全局item级语义对齐的双粒度目标进行联合训练。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上实验表明，ACERec平均NDCG@10提升14.40%，显著优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: ACERec有效调和了语义表达力与计算效率之间的矛盾，为ID-based生成式推荐提供了新范式。

Abstract: Semantic ID-based generative recommendation represents items as sequences of discrete tokens, but it inherently faces a trade-off between representational expressiveness and computational efficiency. Residual Quantization (RQ)-based approaches restrict semantic IDs to be short to enable tractable sequential modeling, while Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ)-based methods compress long semantic IDs through naive rigid aggregation, inevitably discarding fine-grained semantic information. To resolve this dilemma, we propose ACERec, a novel framework that decouples the granularity gap between fine-grained tokenization and efficient sequential modeling. It employs an Attentive Token Merger to distill long expressive semantic tokens into compact latents and introduces a dedicated Intent Token serving as a dynamic prediction anchor. To capture cohesive user intents, we guide the learning process via a dual-granularity objective, harmonizing fine-grained token prediction with global item-level semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on six real-world benchmarks demonstrate that ACERec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average improvement of 14.40\% in NDCG@10, effectively reconciling semantic expressiveness and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 生成式检索在工业大规模场景中存在固有短视性（难以建模长周期、多物品消费模式）和难以支持显式业务指令（如类目控制、策略约束）两大挑战。

Method: 提出Climber-Pilot统一框架：1）Time-Aware Multi-Item Prediction (TAMIP)，利用时序感知掩码将长周期多物品预测知识蒸馏进模型，缓解短视；2）Condition-Guided Sparse Attention (CGSA)，通过稀疏注意力机制在生成过程中直接注入业务约束，无需额外推理步骤。

Result: 在网易云音乐平台的离线实验和线上A/B测试中，Climber-Pilot显著优于SOTA基线，核心业务指标提升4.24%。

Conclusion: Climber-Pilot有效解决了生成式检索的短视性和指令跟随难题，在保持单步高效推理的同时提升了长期建模能力和业务可控性，具备工业落地价值。

Abstract: Generative retrieval has emerged as a promising paradigm in recommender systems, offering superior sequence modeling capabilities over traditional dual-tower architectures. However, in large-scale industrial scenarios, such models often suffer from inherent myopia: due to single-step inference and strict latency constraints, they tend to collapse diverse user intents into locally optimal predictions, failing to capture long-horizon and multi-item consumption patterns. Moreover, real-world retrieval systems must follow explicit retrieval instructions, such as category-level control and policy constraints. Incorporating such instruction-following behavior into generative retrieval remains challenging, as existing conditioning or post-hoc filtering approaches often compromise relevance or efficiency. In this work, we present Climber-Pilot, a unified generative retrieval framework to address both limitations. First, we introduce Time-Aware Multi-Item Prediction (TAMIP), a novel training paradigm designed to mitigate inherent myopia in generative retrieval. By distilling long-horizon, multi-item foresight into model parameters through time-aware masking, TAMIP alleviates locally optimal predictions while preserving efficient single-step inference. Second, to support flexible instruction-following retrieval, we propose Condition-Guided Sparse Attention (CGSA), which incorporates business constraints directly into the generative process via sparse attention, without introducing additional inference steps. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing at NetEase Cloud Music, one of the largest music streaming platforms, demonstrate that Climber-Pilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 4.24\% lift of the core business metric.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出GEMs框架，通过多流解码器解决生成式推荐中长序列处理的计算成本高和注意力机制的近期偏差问题，实现对用户终身行为序列的有效建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推荐在处理极长用户行为序列时面临高计算成本和注意力机制固有的'近期偏差'，难以捕捉用户终身兴趣。

Method: GEMs将用户行为划分为近期、中期和生命周期三个时间流，分别采用实时提取器、轻量级索引器和两阶段离线-在线压缩模块进行建模，并通过无参数融合策略整合各流信息。

Result: 在大规模工业数据集上，GEMs显著优于现有最先进方法；首次成功部署于高并发工业环境，可高效处理超10万交互的用户序列。

Conclusion: GEMs是一种新颖统一的生成式推荐框架，有效突破长序列建模瓶颈，兼顾准确性与推理效率，适用于真实工业场景。

Abstract: While generative recommendations (GR) possess strong sequential reasoning capabilities, they face significant challenges when processing extremely long user behavior sequences: the high computational cost forces practical sequence lengths to be limited, preventing models from capturing users' lifelong interests; meanwhile, the inherent "recency bias" of attention mechanisms further weakens learning from long-term history. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose GEMs (Generative rEcommendation with a Multi-stream decoder), a novel and unified framework designed to break the long-sequence barrier by capturing users' lifelong interaction sequences through a multi-stream perspective. Specifically, GEMs partitions user behaviors into three temporal streams$\unicode{x2014}$Recent, Mid-term, and Lifecycle$\unicode{x2014}$and employs tailored inference schemes for each: a one-stage real-time extractor for immediate dynamics, a lightweight indexer for cross attention to balance accuracy and cost for mid-term sequences, and a two-stage offline-online compression module for lifelong modeling. These streams are integrated via a parameter-free fusion strategy to enable holistic interest representation. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that GEMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recommendation accuracy. Notably, GEMs is the first lifelong GR framework successfully deployed in a high-concurrency industrial environment, achieving superior inference efficiency while processing user sequences of over 100,000 interactions.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法将论文扁平化为无结构文本块，破坏其天然层次结构，导致检索空间混乱、上下文碎片化、证据区域token分配不准及下游模型推理负担加重。

Method: 提出PT-RAG：1）基于论文原生层级构建结构保真PaperTree索引；2）设计路径引导检索机制，将查询语义对齐至相关章节，并在固定token预算下选择高相关性根到叶路径；3）引入基于熵的结构诊断指标评估检索碎片化与证据分配准确性。

Result: 在三个学术问答基准上，PT-RAG相较强基线显著降低章节熵和证据对齐交叉熵，表明上下文更紧凑连贯、证据分配更精准，并直接带来答案质量提升。

Conclusion: 保留并利用论文原生层次结构作为低熵检索先验，可有效缓解传统RAG在长文档问答中的结构性信息损失问题，提升检索效率与生成质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly applied to question-answering over long academic papers, where accurate evidence allocation under a fixed token budget is critical. Existing approaches typically flatten academic papers into unstructured chunks during preprocessing, which destroys the native hierarchical structure. This loss forces retrieval to operate in a disordered space, thereby producing fragmented contexts, misallocating tokens to non-evidential regions under finite token budgets, and increasing the reasoning burden for downstream language models. To address these issues, we propose PT-RAG, an RAG framework that treats the native hierarchical structure of academic papers as a low-entropy retrieval prior. PT-RAG first inherits the native hierarchy to construct a structure-fidelity PaperTree index, which prevents entropy increase at the source. It then designs a path-guided retrieval mechanism that aligns query semantics to relevant sections and selects high relevance root-to-leaf paths under a fixed token budget, yielding compact, coherent, and low-entropy retrieval contexts. In contrast to existing RAG approaches, PT-RAG avoids entropy increase caused by destructive preprocessing and provides a native low-entropy structural basis for subsequent retrieval. To assess this design, we introduce entropy-based structural diagnostics that quantify retrieval fragmentation and evidence allocation accuracy. On three academic question-answering benchmarks, PT-RAG achieves consistently lower section entropy and evidence alignment cross entropy than strong baselines, indicating reduced context fragmentation and more precise allocation to evidential regions. These structural advantages directly translate into higher answer quality.

Conclusion: 该工作为在严苛的大规模生产环境中部署先进MLLM驱动的检索架构提供了稳健且可扩展的技术路径。

Abstract: In this work, we presented Pailitao-VL, a comprehensive multi-modal retrieval system engineered for high-precision, real-time industrial search. We here address three critical challenges in the current SOTA solution: insufficient retrieval granularity, vulnerability to environmental noise, and prohibitive efficiency-performance gap. Our primary contribution lies in two fundamental paradigm shifts. First, we transitioned the embedding paradigm from traditional contrastive learning to an absolute ID-recognition task. Through anchoring instances to a globally consistent latent space defined by billions of semantic prototypes, we successfully overcome the stochasticity and granularity bottlenecks inherent in existing embedding solutions. Second, we evolved the generative reranker from isolated pointwise evaluation to the compare-and-calibrate listwise policy. By synergizing chunk-based comparative reasoning with calibrated absolute relevance scoring, the system achieves nuanced discriminative resolution while circumventing the prohibitive latency typically associated with conventional reranking methods. Extensive offline benchmarks and online A/B tests on Alibaba e-commerce platform confirm that Pailitao-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers substantial business impact. This work demonstrates a robust and scalable path for deploying advanced MLLM-based retrieval architectures in demanding, large-scale production environments.

Conclusion: 双视图设计有效缓解了模态不对齐与细粒度语义丢失问题，验证了融合MLLM能力与原始文本信息对序列推荐的协同增益。

Abstract: Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS) aim to predict users' next interaction based on their historical behaviors, while still facing the challenge of data sparsity. With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), leveraging their multimodal understanding capabilities to enrich item semantic representation has emerged as an effective enhancement strategy for SRS. However, existing MLLM-enhanced recommendation methods still suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to effectively align multimodal representations, leading to suboptimal utilization of semantic information across modalities. Second, they often overly rely on MLLM-generated content while overlooking the fine-grained semantic cues contained in the original textual data of items. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-view MLLM-based Enhancing framework for multimodal Sequential Recommendation (DMESR). For the misalignment issue, we employ a contrastive learning mechanism to align the cross-modal semantic representations generated by MLLMs. For the loss of fine-grained semantics, we introduce a cross-attention fusion module that integrates the coarse-grained semantic knowledge obtained from MLLMs with the fine-grained original textual semantics. Finally, these two fused representations can be seamlessly integrated into the downstream sequential recommendation models. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets and three popular sequential recommendation architectures demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出DualGraph记忆架构，通过分离知识图谱（KG）与大纲图谱（OG），支持LLM代理在开放性深度研究（OEDR）中实现更高效、结构化、知识驱动的迭代探索与报告生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OEDR代理存在两类缺陷：线性‘检索-生成’易导致信息过载和‘中间丢失’；大纲中心式规划难以显式识别知识缺口，缺乏对针对性探索的有效监督。

Method: 提出DualGraph记忆架构，包含协同演化的Outline Graph（OG）和Knowledge Graph（KG）；KG以细粒度实体、概念及关系建模语义知识，OG刻画报告结构；二者联合分析用于生成目标明确的搜索查询，驱动知识驱动的迭代探索与精炼。

Result: 在DeepResearch Bench、DeepResearchGym和DeepConsult三个基准上，DualGraph显著超越SOTA基线，在报告深度、广度和事实依据性方面均提升；例如在DeepResearch Bench上使用GPT-5达53.08 RACE分数；消融实验证实双图设计是性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: DualGraph通过解耦‘所知’与‘所写’，为开放性深度研究提供了可扩展、可解释、知识感知的记忆机制，有效克服了现有LLM代理在长周期复杂推理任务中的结构性瓶颈。

Abstract: Open-Ended Deep Research (OEDR) pushes LLM agents beyond short-form QA toward long-horizon workflows that iteratively search, connect, and synthesize evidence into structured reports. However, existing OEDR agents largely follow either linear ``search-then-generate'' accumulation or outline-centric planning. The former suffers from lost-in-the-middle failures as evidence grows, while the latter relies on the LLM to implicitly infer knowledge gaps from the outline alone, providing weak supervision for identifying missing relations and triggering targeted exploration. We present DualGraph memory, an architecture that separates what the agent knows from how it writes. DualGraph maintains two co-evolving graphs: an Outline Graph (OG), and a Knowledge Graph (KG), a semantic memory that stores fine-grained knowledge units, including core entities, concepts, and their relations. By analyzing the KG topology together with structural signals from the OG, DualGraph generates targeted search queries, enabling more efficient and comprehensive iterative knowledge-driven exploration and refinement. Across DeepResearch Bench, DeepResearchGym, and DeepConsult, DualGraph consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in report depth, breadth, and factual grounding; for example, it reaches a 53.08 RACE score on DeepResearch Bench with GPT-5.

Motivation: 现有触发式推荐方法存在意图短视问题（过度依赖触发项）和ID级交互稀疏导致偏好建模受限的问题。

Method: 提出DAIAN模型：1）基于用户点击与触发项的相关性提取个性化意图表示，并检索相关历史行为以挖掘多样意图；2）设计融合ID与语义信息的混合增强器，并根据意图自适应选择相似项。

Result: 在公开数据集和工业电商数据集上的实验验证了DAIAN在推荐效果上的显著提升。

Conclusion: DAIAN能有效缓解意图短视与交互稀疏问题，实现更精准、多样且实时的触发式推荐。

Abstract: Recommendation systems are essential for personalizing e-commerce shopping experiences. Among these, Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR) has emerged as a key scenario, which utilizes a trigger item (explicitly represents a user's instantaneous interest), enabling precise, real-time recommendations. Although several trigger-based techniques have been proposed, most of them struggle to address the intent myopia issue, that is, a recommendation system overemphasizes the role of trigger items and narrowly focuses on suggesting commodities that are highly relevant to trigger items. Meanwhile, existing methods rely on collaborative behavior patterns between trigger and recommended items to identify the user's preferences, yet the sparsity of ID-based interaction restricts their effectiveness. To this end, we propose the Deep Adaptive Intent-Aware Network (DAIAN) that dynamically adapts to users' intent preferences. In general, we first extract the users' personalized intent representations by analyzing the correlation between a user's click and the trigger item, and accordingly retrieve the user's related historical behaviors to mine the user's diverse intent. Besides, sparse collaborative behaviors constrain the performance in capturing items associated with user intent. Hence, we reinforce similarity by leveraging a hybrid enhancer with ID and semantic information, followed by adaptive selection based on varying intents. Experimental results on public datasets and our industrial e-commerce datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAIAN.

Conclusion: MixFormer通过统一架构实现序列建模与特征交互的高效协同扩展，兼顾表达力与工业实用性，为大规模推荐系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: As industrial recommender systems enter a scaling-driven regime, Transformer architectures have become increasingly attractive for scaling models towards larger capacity and longer sequence. However, existing Transformer-based recommendation models remain structurally fragmented, where sequence modeling and feature interaction are implemented as separate modules with independent parameterization. Such designs introduce a fundamental co-scaling challenge, as model capacity must be suboptimally allocated between dense feature interaction and sequence modeling under a limited computational budget. In this work, we propose MixFormer, a unified Transformer-style architecture tailored for recommender systems, which jointly models sequential behaviors and feature interactions within a single backbone. Through a unified parameterization, MixFormer enables effective co-scaling across both dense capacity and sequence length, mitigating the trade-off observed in decoupled designs. Moreover, the integrated architecture facilitates deep interaction between sequential and non-sequential representations, allowing high-order feature semantics to directly inform sequence aggregation and enhancing overall expressiveness. To ensure industrial practicality, we further introduce a user-item decoupling strategy for efficiency optimizations that significantly reduce redundant computation and inference latency. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that MixFormer consistently exhibits superior accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, large-scale online A/B tests on two production recommender systems, Douyin and Douyin Lite, show consistent improvements in user engagement metrics, including active days and in-app usage duration.

Motivation: 现有基于深度贝叶斯老虎机的矩形检索区域预测方法存在精度和效率瓶颈，难以满足全球多样化房源与用户多维需求（位置、设施、风格、价格）的匹配要求。

Method: 提出一种新检索架构：将世界划分为2500万个均匀矩形地图单元，基于历史预订数据识别并优先检索‘最可预订’的高精度单元，替代原有粗粒度矩形区域预测。

Result: 新架构显著提升了检索阶段的精度与效率，缩小了候选集规模，降低了后续排序模型的资源开销，并增强了对用户地理位置偏好的响应能力。

Conclusion: 将全球地理空间离散化为高精度固定单元并进行可预订性建模，是一种更鲁棒、可扩展且业务导向的检索范式，适用于大规模住宿平台的搜索系统。

Abstract: Airbnb search must balance a worldwide, highly varied supply of homes with guests whose location, amenity, style, and price expectations differ widely. Meeting those expectations hinges on an efficient retrieval stage that surfaces only the listings a guest might realistically book, before resource intensive ranking models are applied to determine the best results. Unlike many recommendation engines, our system faces a distinctive challenge, location retrieval, that sits upstream of ranking and determines which geographic areas are queried in order to filter inventory to a candidate set. The preexisting approach employs a deep bayesian bandit based system to predict a rectangular retrieval bounds area that can be used for filtering. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the methodology, challenges, and impact of rearchitecting search to retrieve from the subset of most bookable high precision rectangular map cells defined by dividing the world into 25M uniform cells.

Motivation: 新商品在电商平台上因交互数据稀疏导致搜索可见性低、排序相关性差，面临严重的冷启动问题。

Method: 提出行为特征增强方法（BFS），利用产品间的替代关系识别满足相似用户需求的替代品，并聚合其点击、加购、购买、评分等行为信号，为新商品提供‘热启动’特征；将这些增强信号融入排序模型。

Result: 在大型电商平台的离线与在线实验中，BFS显著提升了冷启动商品的搜索相关性和发现效果；该方法具备可扩展性与实用性，已部署上线并自2025年起服务用户。

Conclusion: BFS是一种简单有效、可落地的冷启动解决方案，通过行为信号迁移提升新商品排序质量，兼顾平台竞争力与用户体验。

Abstract: On E-commerce platforms, new products often suffer from the cold-start problem: limited interaction data reduces their search visibility and hurts relevance ranking. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective behavior feature boosting method that leverages substitute relationships among products (BFS). BFS identifies substitutes-products that satisfy similar user needs-and aggregates their behavioral signals (e.g., clicks, add-to-carts, purchases, and ratings) to provide a warm start for new items. Incorporating these enriched signals into ranking models mitigates cold-start effects and improves relevance and competitiveness. Experiments on a large E-commerce platform, both offline and online, show that BFS significantly improves search relevance and product discovery for cold-start products. BFS is scalable and practical, improving user experience while increasing exposure for newly launched items in E-commerce search. The BFS-enhanced ranking model has been launched in production and has served customers since 2025.

Motivation: 扩散推荐系统虽准确率高，但存在流行度偏差，导致物品曝光不均。

Method: 提出A2G-DiffRec模型，采用自适应自动引导机制：用训练较弱的自身模型作为引导器，动态学习主模型与弱模型输出的加权系数，并引入基于流行度的正则化损失以平衡不同流行度物品的曝光。

Result: 在MovieLens-1M、Foursquare-Tokyo和Music4All-Onion数据集上验证，A2G-DiffRec显著提升物品侧公平性，仅带来轻微准确率下降。

Conclusion: 自适应自动引导结合流行度正则化可有效缓解扩散推荐中的流行度偏差，在公平性与准确性间取得更好权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion recommender systems achieve strong recommendation accuracy but often suffer from popularity bias, resulting in unequal item exposure. To address this shortcoming, we introduce A2G-DiffRec, a diffusion recommender that incorporates adaptive autoguidance, where the main model is guided by a less-trained version of itself. Instead of using a fixed guidance weight, A2G-DiffRec learns to adaptively weigh the outputs of the main and weak models during training, supervised by a popularity regularization that promotes balanced exposure across items with different popularity levels. Experimental results on the MovieLens-1M, Foursquare-Tokyo, and Music4All-Onion datasets show that A2G-DiffRec is effective in enhancing item-side fairness at a marginal cost of accuracy reduction compared to existing guided diffusion recommenders and other non-diffusion baselines.

Abstract: Conversational search (CS) requires a complex software engineering pipeline that integrates query reformulation, ranking, and response generation. CS researchers currently face two barriers: the lack of a unified framework for efficiently sharing contributions with the community, and the difficulty of deploying end-to-end prototypes needed for user evaluation. We introduce Orcheo, an open-source platform designed to bridge this gap. Orcheo offers three key advantages: (i) A modular architecture promotes component reuse through single-file node modules, facilitating sharing and reproducibility in CS research; (ii) Production-ready infrastructure bridges the prototype-to-system gap via dual execution modes, secure credential management, and execution telemetry, with built-in AI coding support that lowers the learning curve; (iii) Starter-kit assets include 50+ off-the-shelf components for query understanding, ranking, and response generation, enabling the rapid bootstrapping of complete CS pipelines. We describe the framework architecture and validate Orcheo's utility through case studies that highlight modularity and ease of use.

*Christos Koutsiaris*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于用户意图的动态分块方法（IDC），利用大语言模型预测用户查询意图，并通过动态规划算法确定最优分块边界，显著提升了长文档检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分块方法（如固定长度或基于连贯性）忽略用户意图，导致答案被切分或引入无关噪声，影响检索效果。

Method: 提出Intent-Driven Dynamic Chunking（IDC）：先用大语言模型生成文档可能对应的用户意图，再用动态规划算法寻找全局最优分块边界。

Result: 在6个问答数据集上测试，IDC在5个数据集上超越基线方法，top-1检索准确率提升5%–67%，第6个持平；同时分块数量减少40–60%，答案覆盖率保持93–100%。

Conclusion: 将文档结构与预期信息需求对齐，能显著提升检索性能，尤其适用于长且异构的文档。

Abstract: Breaking long documents into smaller segments is a fundamental challenge in information retrieval. Whether for search engines, question-answering systems, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), effective segmentation determines how well systems can locate and return relevant information. However, traditional methods, such as fixed-length or coherence-based segmentation, ignore user intent, leading to chunks that split answers or contain irrelevant noise. We introduce Intent-Driven Dynamic Chunking (IDC), a novel approach that uses predicted user queries to guide document segmentation. IDC leverages a Large Language Model to generate likely user intents for a document and then employs a dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal chunk boundaries. This represents a novel application of DP to intent-aware segmentation that avoids greedy pitfalls. We evaluated IDC on six diverse question-answering datasets, including news articles, Wikipedia, academic papers, and technical documentation. IDC outperformed traditional chunking strategies on five datasets, improving top-1 retrieval accuracy by 5% to 67%, and matched the best baseline on the sixth. Additionally, IDC produced 40-60% fewer chunks than baseline methods while achieving 93-100% answer coverage. These results demonstrate that aligning document structure with anticipated information needs significantly boosts retrieval performance, particularly for long and heterogeneous documents.

Abstract: Neural models are increasingly used in Web-scale Information Retrieval (IR). However, relying on these models introduces substantial computational and energy requirements, leading to increasing attention toward their environmental cost and the sustainability of large-scale deployments. While neural IR models deliver high retrieval effectiveness, their scalability is constrained in multi-domain scenarios, where training and maintaining domain-specific models is inefficient and achieving robust cross-domain generalisation within a unified model remains difficult. This paper introduces DRAMA (Domain Retrieval using Adaptive Module Allocation), an energy- and parameter-efficient framework designed to reduce the environmental footprint of neural retrieval. DRAMA integrates domain-specific adapter modules with a dynamic gating mechanism that selects the most relevant domain knowledge for each query. New domains can be added efficiently through lightweight adapter training, avoiding full model retraining. We evaluate DRAMA on multiple Web retrieval benchmarks covering different domains. Our extensive evaluation shows that DRAMA achieves comparable effectiveness to domain-specific models while using only a fraction of their parameters and computational resources. These findings show that energy-aware model design can significantly improve scalability and sustainability in neural IR.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed robotics, healthcare, industry, and scientific discovery, yet a major frontier may lie beyond Earth. Space exploration and settlement offer vast environments and resources, but impose constraints unmatched on Earth: delayed/intermittent communications, extreme resource scarcity, heterogeneous expertise, and strict safety, accountability, and command authority. The key challenge is auditable coordination among specialised humans, robots, and digital services in a safety-critical system-of-systems. We introduce Agent Mars, an open, end-to-end multi-agent simulation framework for Mars base operations. Agent Mars formalises a realistic organisation with a 93-agent roster across seven layers of command and execution (human roles and physical assets), enabling base-scale studies beyond toy settings. It implements hierarchical and cross-layer coordination that preserves chain-of-command while allowing vetted cross-layer exchanges with audit trails; supports dynamic role handover with automatic failover under outages; and enables phase-dependent leadership for routine operations, emergencies, and science campaigns. Agent Mars further models mission-critical mechanisms-scenario-aware short/long-horizon memory, configurable propose-vote consensus, and translator-mediated heterogeneous protocols-to capture how teams align under stress. To quantify behaviour, we propose the Agent Mars Performance Index (AMPI), an interpretable composite score with diagnostic sub-metrics. Across 13 reproducible Mars-relevant operational scripts, Agent Mars reveals coordination trade-offs and identifies regimes where curated cross-layer collaboration and functional leadership reduce overhead without sacrificing reliability. Agent Mars provides a benchmarkable, auditable foundation for Space AI.

Conclusion: AVD有效应对了城市动态多智能体系统中的异构性、异步性和行为多样性挑战，具备良好的实用性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) provides a promising paradigm for coordinating multi-agent systems (MAS). However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a fixed number of agents and fully synchronous action execution. These assumptions are often violated in urban systems, where the number of active agents varies over time, and actions may have heterogeneous durations, resulting in a semi-MARL setting. Moreover, while sharing policy parameters among agents is commonly adopted to improve learning efficiency, it can lead to highly homogeneous actions when a subset of agents make decisions concurrently under similar observations, potentially degrading coordination quality. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Value Decomposition (AVD), a cooperative MARL framework that adapts to a dynamically changing agent population. AVD further incorporates a lightweight mechanism to mitigate action homogenization induced by shared policies, thereby encouraging behavioral diversity and maintaining effective cooperation among agents. In addition, we design a training-execution strategy tailored to the semi-MARL setting that accommodates asynchronous decision-making when some agents act at different times. Experiments on real-world bike-sharing redistribution tasks in two major cities, London and Washington, D.C., demonstrate that AVD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: As a pioneer of the third-generation photovoltaic revolution, Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) are renowned for their superior optoelectronic performance and cost potential. The development process of PSCs is precise and complex, involving a series of closed-loop workflows such as literature retrieval, data integration, experimental design, and synthesis. However, existing AI perovskite approaches focus predominantly on discrete models, including material design, process optimization,and property prediction. These models fail to propagate physical constraints across the workflow, hindering end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system for perovskite material discovery, named PeroMAS. We first encapsulated a series of perovskite-specific tools into Model Context Protocols (MCPs). By planning and invoking these tools, PeroMAS can design perovskite materials under multi-objective constraints, covering the entire process from literature retrieval and data extraction to property prediction and mechanism analysis. Furthermore, we construct an evaluation benchmark by perovskite human experts to assess this multi-agent system. Results demonstrate that, compared to single Large Language Model (LLM) or traditional search strategies, our system significantly enhances discovery efficiency. It successfully identified candidate materials satisfying multi-objective constraints. Notably, we verify PeroMAS's effectiveness in the physical world through real synthesis experiments.

Conclusion: MF-RQE是一种更具一般性与实用性的平均场均衡概念，兼顾风险敏感性与认知现实性，为多智能体系统在复杂不确定性环境中的建模与学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in mean-field game literature enable the reduction of large-scale multi-agent problems to tractable interactions between a representative agent and a population distribution. However, existing approaches typically assume a fixed initial population distribution and fully rational agents, limiting robustness under distributional uncertainty and cognitive constraints. We address these limitations by introducing risk aversion with respect to the initial population distribution and by incorporating bounded rationality to model deviations from fully rational decision-making agents. The combination of these two elements yields a new and more general equilibrium concept, which we term the mean-field risk-averse quantal response equilibrium (MF-RQE). We establish existence results and prove convergence of fixed-point iteration and fictitious play to MF-RQE. Building on these insights, we develop a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm for scenarios with large state-action spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate that MF-RQE policies achieve improved robustness relative to classical mean-field approaches that optimize expected cumulative rewards under a fixed initial distribution and are restricted to entropy-based regularizers.

Motivation: 多智能体系统中，基于自然语言的通信易导致语义漂移、幻觉传播和高token消耗，亟需更精确、可验证的通信机制。

Method: 设计G2CP协议，将智能体消息定义为对共享知识图谱的显式图操作（如遍历指令、子图片段、更新操作），并在工业知识管理系统中部署四类专业化智能体协同验证。

Result: 在500个工业场景和21个真实维修案例中，G2CP降低通信token 73%，任务准确率提升34%，彻底消除级联幻觉，并生成完全可审计的推理链。

Conclusion: G2CP标志着多智能体通信从语言范式向结构范式的根本转变，适用于所有需要高精度智能体协同的领域。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models face a critical challenge: agents communicate through natural language, leading to semantic drift, hallucination propagation, and inefficient token consumption. We propose G2CP (Graph-Grounded Communication Protocol), a structured agent communication language where messages are graph operations rather than free text. Agents exchange explicit traversal commands, subgraph fragments, and update operations over a shared knowledge graph, enabling verifiable reasoning traces and eliminating ambiguity. We validate G2CP within an industrial knowledge management system where specialized agents (Diagnostic, Procedural, Synthesis, and Ingestion) coordinate to answer complex queries. Experimental results on 500 industrial scenarios and 21 real-world maintenance cases show that G2CP reduces inter-agent communication tokens by 73%, improves task completion accuracy by 34% over free-text baselines, eliminates cascading hallucinations, and produces fully auditable reasoning chains. G2CP represents a fundamental shift from linguistic to structural communication in multi-agent systems, with implications for any domain requiring precise agent coordination. Code, data, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM多智能体系统缺乏部署后的动态适应能力，难以应对新任务和环境变化。

Method: 提出MASFly框架，包含两个核心机制：1）检索增强的标准操作流程（SOP）实例化，利用自建的成功协作模式库动态构建定制化多智能体系统；2）经验引导的监督机制，由Watcher智能体基于个性化经验池实时监控并干预系统执行。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准上达到61.7%的成功率，显著优于现有方法，并展现出强任务适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MASFly为LLM多智能体系统提供了有效的测试时动态自适应能力，验证了借鉴生物适应机制设计AI系统的新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, existing works often rely on manual designs or "one-size-fits-all" automation, lacking dynamic adaptability after deployment. Inspired by how biological systems adapt, we introduce MASFly, a novel multi-agent framework enabling dynamic adaptation at test time. To adapt system generation, MASFly employs a retrieval-augmented SOP instantiation mechanism that leverages a self-constructed repository of successful collaboration patterns, enabling the LLM to assemble customized MASs for new queries. For adaptive execution, MASFly incorporates an experience-guided supervision mechanism, where a dedicated Watcher agent monitors system behaviors with reference to a personalized experience pool and provides real-time interventions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASFly achieves state-of-the-art performance, most notably a 61.7% success rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, while exhibiting strong task adaptability and robustness.

### [268] [Testing BDI-based Multi-Agent Systems using Discrete Event Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13878)
*Martina Baiardi,Samuele Burattini,Giovanni Ciatto,Danilo Pianini*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何将BDI（信念-愿望-意图）认知代理模型无缝集成到离散事件仿真（DES）中，以提升多智能体系统仿真测试的真实性，并通过JaKtA与Alchemist的开源原型验证了不同粒度映射对仿真保真度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BDI代理代码难以直接在仿真环境中运行，导致部署系统与仿真系统间存在显著‘现实差距’，影响测试有效性；亟需一种能直接仿真原始BDI规范的方法。

Method: 提出将BDI代理的控制流映射到离散事件仿真（DES）框架的方法，支持多种粒度映射；基于现有工具JaKtA（BDI平台）和Alchemist（DES平台）构建开源原型集成。

Result: 成功实现JaKtA与Alchemist的原型集成，验证了BDI代理可在DES中直接仿真运行；实证表明不同映射粒度确实影响仿真保真度。

Conclusion: BDI代理可原样（无需代理表示）集成至DES进行仿真测试；映射粒度是调控仿真保真度的关键设计维度，为多智能体系统可信测试提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems are designed to deal with open, distributed systems with unpredictable dynamics, which makes them inherently hard to test. The value of using simulation for this purpose is recognized in the literature, although achieving sufficient fidelity (i.e., the degree of similarity between the simulation and the real-world system) remains a challenging task. This is exacerbated when dealing with cognitive agent models, such as the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) model, where the agent codebase is not suitable to run unchanged in simulation environments, thus increasing the reality gap between the deployed and simulated systems. We argue that BDI developers should be able to test in simulation the same specification that will be later deployed, with no surrogate representations. Thus, in this paper, we discuss how the control flow of BDI agents can be mapped onto a Discrete Event Simulation (DES), showing that such integration is possible at different degrees of granularity. We substantiate our claims by producing an open-source prototype integration between two pre-existing tools (JaKtA and Alchemist), showing that it is possible to produce a simulation-based testing environment for distributed BDI} agents, and that different granularities in mapping BDI agents over DESs may lead to different degrees of fidelity.

*Furkan Mumcu,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Socially-Weighted Alignment (SWA) 的博弈论框架，通过在推理时插值个体目标与群体福利估计，缓解多LLM代理共享环境中的负外部性问题；理论证明其在拥塞博弈中存在临界社会权重阈值λ*，超过该阈值系统可实现从持续拥塞到稳定运行的相变；并给出无需参数更新或MARL的推理时算法实现，经多智能体仿真验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署大语言模型（LLM）代理于共享环境中，个体理性决策可能带来负外部性，损害系统级性能，亟需协调个体对齐与集体稳定性。

Method: 提出Socially-Weighted Alignment（SWA）框架，在推理时以社会权重λ∈[0,1]加权融合代理私有目标与群体福利估计；在n代理、拥塞严重度β的共享资源拥塞博弈中进行理论分析；设计无需参数更新或MARL的推理时算法，并通过多代理仿真验证。

Result: 理论推导出临界阈值λ*=(n−β)/(n−1)，当λ>λ*时，代理在过载下不再有边际动机增加需求，系统发生从持续拥塞到近容量稳定运行的相变；仿真结果证实该阈值行为。

Conclusion: SWA为多LLM代理系统提供了一种轻量、可解释且理论保障的推理时对齐机制，有效平衡个体理性与集体稳定性，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Deploying large language model (LLM) agents in shared environments introduces a fundamental tension between individual alignment and collective stability: locally rational decisions can impose negative externalities that degrade system-level performance. We propose Socially-Weighted Alignment (SWA), a game-theoretic framework that modifies inference-time decision making by interpolating between an agent's private objective and an estimate of group welfare via a social weight $λ\in[0,1]$. In a shared-resource congestion game with $n$ agents and congestion severity $β$, we show that SWA induces a critical threshold $λ^*=(n-β)/(n-1)$ above which agents no longer have marginal incentive to increase demand under overload, yielding a phase transition from persistent congestion to stable operation near capacity. We further provide an inference-time algorithmic instantiation of SWA that does not require parameter updates or multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a multi-agent simulation to empirically validate the predicted threshold behavior.

*Jose Manuel de la Chica Rodriguez,Juan Manuel Vera Díaz*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的治理架构，将认知、选择和行动分离为不同领域，通过机械强制的原语限制选择与行动自主性，从而在高风险监管场景中保障自主代理系统的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法（如对齐、可解释性、动作过滤）不足以应对高风险领域中不可逆决策和制度约束的问题，尤其无法直接管控‘选择权’——即决定哪些选项被生成、呈现和框架化以供决策的权力。

Method: 提出一种分离认知、选择与行动的治理架构，引入外部候选生成（CEFL）、受控缩减器、提交-揭示熵隔离、理由验证及‘失败即高亮’断路器等机制，并在多个受监管金融场景中进行对抗性压力测试。

Result: 实验证明该架构可实施、可审计，能防止确定性结果捕获，同时保留推理能力；虽仍存在概率性集中现象，但相比传统标量流水线显著约束了选择权。

Conclusion: 将治理重新定义为‘有界因果力’而非内部意图对齐，为‘静默失效不可接受’的场景下部署自主代理提供了新基础。

Abstract: Autonomous agentic systems are increasingly deployed in regulated, high-stakes domains where decisions may be irreversible and institutionally constrained. Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ST-EVO的新型自演化多智能体系统，从时空联合视角出发，通过基于流匹配的调度器实现对话级通信调度，并具备不确定性感知与自反馈学习能力，在九个基准测试中实现了5%–25%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自演化多智能体系统（MAS）主要局限于空间或时间单维度演化，未能充分激发大语言模型（LLM）的协同能力，亟需一种能兼顾时空动态性的新范式。

Method: 提出ST-EVO框架，引入基于流匹配的紧凑型Scheduler，支持对话粒度的时空联合通信调度；融合不确定性感知机制与自反馈学习模块，使系统能从历史经验中持续优化。

Result: 在九个基准任务上取得SOTA性能，准确率相对基线提升5%–25%。

Conclusion: 时空联合演化是提升LLM多智能体协同效能的关键路径，ST-EVO验证了该范式的有效性与可扩展性。

Abstract: LLM-powered Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as an effective approach towards collaborative intelligence, and have attracted wide research interests. Among them, ``self-evolving'' MAS, treated as a more flexible and powerful technical route, can construct task-adaptive workflows or communication topologies, instead of relying on a predefined static structue template. Current self-evolving MAS mainly focus on Spatial Evolving or Temporal Evolving paradigm, which only considers the single dimension of evolution and does not fully incentivize LLMs' collaborative capability. In this work, we start from a novel Spatio-Temporal perspective by proposing ST-EVO, which supports dialogue-wise communication scheduling with a compact yet powerful flow-matching based Scheduler. To make precise Spatio-Temporal scheduling, ST-EVO can also perceive the uncertainty of MAS, and possesses self-feedback ability to learn from accumulated experience. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ST-EVO, achieving about 5%--25% accuracy improvement.

Motivation: 解决环岛处多模态、混合交通（尤其是车辆与弱势道路使用者VRU共存）带来的安全与效率挑战，利用预测与协同控制实现 proactive 速度引导。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的单步预测模型，联合预测车辆与VRU轨迹；引入运动动力学建模与路线意图信息；部署为自回归模式生成确定性轨迹；基于预测冲突生成实时速度建议。

Result: 在5秒预测时域上达到ADE 1.29m、FDE 2.99m（加路线意图为ADE 1.10m、FDE 2.36m），显著优于先前方法；实证表明可提升车辆通行效率与实际/感知安全性。

Conclusion: ROSA通过高精度、确定性轨迹预测与协同速度引导，在环岛场景中有效兼顾交通效率与多主体（尤其VRU）安全，验证了融合意图与动力学的预测框架及边缘可部署策略的有效性。

Abstract: We present ROSA -- Roundabout Optimized Speed Advisory -- a system that combines multi-agent trajectory prediction with coordinated speed guidance for multimodal, mixed traffic at roundabouts. Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective.

Conclusion: DQGP为融合量子计算与分布式机器学习提供了新范式，不仅提升了高斯过程的建模能力与可扩展性，也为未来量子硬件加速概率建模与优化任务奠定了基础。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for probabilistic modeling, but their performance is often constrained in complex, largescale real-world domains due to the limited expressivity of classical kernels. Quantum computing offers the potential to overcome this limitation by embedding data into exponentially large Hilbert spaces, capturing complex correlations that remain inaccessible to classical computing approaches. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Quantum Gaussian Process (DQGP) method in a multiagent setting to enhance modeling capabilities and scalability. To address the challenging non-Euclidean optimization problem, we develop a Distributed consensus Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DR-ADMM) algorithm that aggregates local agent models into a global model. We evaluate the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments conducted on a quantum simulator in classical hardware. We use real-world, non-stationary elevation datasets of NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and synthetic datasets generated by Quantum Gaussian Processes. Beyond modeling advantages, our framework highlights potential computational speedups that quantum hardware may provide, particularly in Gaussian processes and distributed optimization.

*Zeyi Zhang,Zixi Kang,Ruijie Zhao,Yusen Feng,Biao Jiang,Libin Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出ProAct双系统框架，通过分离低延迟行为系统与慢速认知系统，解决实时交互中主动社交行为的时间尺度冲突，并引入基于ControlNet的流式流匹配模型实现意图到非语言行为的无缝转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互系统多为反应式，缺乏基于长期上下文和意图推断的主动社交行为，而主动行为又难以满足实时交互的严格延迟要求。

Method: 提出双系统框架ProAct：低延迟的行为系统负责流式多模态交互，较慢的认知系统进行长时程社交推理并生成高层主动意图；利用ControlNet条件化的流式流匹配模型将意图转化为连续非语言行为，支持异步意图注入。

Result: 在实体人形机器人上部署并评估，用户研究显示ProAct在感知主动性、社会临场感和整体参与度上均优于纯反应式系统。

Conclusion: 双系统架构能有效协调时间尺度冲突，提升具身社交代理的主动性和交互质量。

Abstract: Embodied social agents have recently advanced in generating synchronized speech and gestures. However, most interactive systems remain fundamentally reactive, responding only to current sensory inputs within a short temporal window. Proactive social behavior, in contrast, requires deliberation over accumulated context and intent inference, which conflicts with the strict latency budget of real-time interaction. We present \emph{ProAct}, a dual-system framework that reconciles this time-scale conflict by decoupling a low-latency \emph{Behavioral System} for streaming multimodal interaction from a slower \emph{Cognitive System} which performs long-horizon social reasoning and produces high-level proactive intentions. To translate deliberative intentions into continuous non-verbal behaviors without disrupting fluency, we introduce a streaming flow-matching model conditioned on intentions via ControlNet. This mechanism supports asynchronous intention injection, enabling seamless transitions between reactive and proactive gestures within a single motion stream. We deploy ProAct on a physical humanoid robot and evaluate both motion quality and interactive effectiveness. In real-world interaction user studies, participants and observers consistently prefer ProAct over reactive variants in perceived proactivity, social presence, and overall engagement, demonstrating the benefits of dual-system proactive control for embodied social interaction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向多无人机系统的语言闭环控制架构，融合自然语言指令、大语言模型（LLM）监督与分布式内环控制，在保证物理层鲁棒性的同时实现动态高层任务执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多无人机系统在执行动态、高层任务时，如何兼顾自然语言交互的灵活性与物理控制层的形式化鲁棒性保障问题。

Method: 设计三层架构：人类操作员输入自然语言指令；LLM监督器周期性地结合最新状态与目标估计进行任务解释、验证与修正；分布式内环控制器仅依赖局部相对信息跟踪LLM生成的参考信号；并理论分析了在有界扰动和LLM引发的分段光滑跳变参考下的跟踪性能。

Result: 推导出在有界扰动和分段光滑、含离散跳变的参考信号下，系统跟踪性能的理论保证；验证了语言驱动任务推理与分布式反馈控制协同实现复杂行为的可行性。

Conclusion: 中心化的语言任务推理可与分布式的反馈控制有效结合，在确保形式化鲁棒性和稳定性前提下，支持多无人机系统完成复杂、演化的高层任务。

Abstract: We study language-in-the-loop control for multi-drone systems that execute evolving, high-level missions while retaining formal robustness guarantees at the physical layer. We propose a three-layer architecture in which (i) a human operator issues natural-language instructions, (ii) an LLM-based supervisor periodically interprets, verifies, and corrects the commanded task in the context of the latest state and target estimates, and (iii) a distributed inner-loop controller tracks the resulting reference using only local relative information. We derive a theoretical guarantee that characterizes tracking performance under bounded disturbances and piecewise-smooth references with discrete jumps induced by LLM updates. Overall, our results illustrate how centralized language-based task reasoning can be combined with distributed feedback control to achieve complex behaviors with provable robustness and stability.

Conclusion: DORA有效提升了机器人系统在数据密集场景下的通信效率与运行性能，尤其适用于工业级Python环境与多尺度数据交互需求。

Abstract: Robotic middleware serves as the foundational infrastructure, enabling complex robotic systems to operate in a coordinated and modular manner. In data-intensive robotic applications, especially in industrial scenarios, communication efficiency directly impact system responsiveness, stability, and overall productivity. However, existing robotic middleware exhibit several limitations: (1) they rely heavily on (de)serialization mechanisms, introducing significant overhead for large-sized data; (2) they lack efficient and flexible support for heterogeneous data sizes, particularly in intra-robot communication and Python-based execution environments. To address these challenges, we propose Dataflow-Oriented Robotic Architecture (DORA) that enables explicit data dependency specification and efficient zero-copy data transmission. We implement the proposed framework as an open-source system and evaluate it through extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and CPU overhead compared to state-of-the-art middleware.

Abstract: Mechanically characterizing the human-machine interface is essential to understanding user behavior and optimizing wearable robot performance. This interface has been challenging to sensorize due to manufacturing complexity and non-linear sensor responses. Here, we measure human limb-device interaction via fluidic innervation, creating a 3D-printed silicone pad with embedded air channels to measure forces. As forces are applied to the pad, the air channels compress, resulting in a pressure change measurable by off-the-shelf pressure transducers. We demonstrate in benchtop testing that pad pressure is highly linearly related to applied force ($R^2 = 0.998$). This is confirmed with clinical dynamometer correlations with isometric knee torque, where above-knee pressure was highly correlated with flexion torque ($R^2 = 0.95$), while below-knee pressure was highly correlated with extension torque ($R^2 = 0.75$). We build on these idealized settings to test pad performance in more unconstrained settings. We place the pad over \textit{biceps brachii} during cyclic curls and stepwise isometric holds, observing a correlation between pressure and elbow angle. Finally, we integrated the sensor into the strap of a lower-extremity robotic exoskeleton and recorded pad pressure during repeated squats with the device unpowered. Pad pressure tracked squat phase and overall task dynamics consistently. Overall, our preliminary results suggest fluidic innervation is a readily customizable sensing modality with high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for capturing human-machine mechanical interaction. In the long-term, this modality may provide an alternative real-time sensing input to control / optimize wearable robotic systems and to capture user function during device use.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出FlowHOI，一种两阶段流匹配框架，用于生成语义明确、时间连贯的手-物交互（HOI）序列，显著提升长时程、接触密集型操作任务的性能与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在长时程、接触密集型操作任务中表现不佳，因其未显式建模手-物交互（HOI）结构；缺乏具身无关、可验证且可跨机器人迁移的HOI表征。

Method: 提出FlowHOI：第一阶段解耦几何导向的抓取与语义导向的操作；第二阶段基于3D高斯泼溅场景重建、紧凑3D场景token及运动-文本对齐损失，生成包含手姿、物姿与接触状态的HOI序列；并构建HOI重建管线，从大规模自我中心视频中恢复对齐的手-物轨迹与网格以提供先验。

Result: 在GRAB和HOT3D基准上，FlowHOI取得最高动作识别精度，物理仿真成功率较最强扩散基线高1.7倍，推理速度快40倍；并在真实机器人上成功执行四种灵巧操作任务。

Conclusion: FlowHOI通过显式建模和生成结构化HOI序列，有效提升了VLA模型在复杂操作任务中的可解释性、可迁移性与实际部署能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models can generate plausible end-effector motions, yet they often fail in long-horizon, contact-rich tasks because the underlying hand-object interaction (HOI) structure is not explicitly represented. An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在转向率受限的追逃博弈中，准确估计追击者参数对规划安全路径至关重要，但传统方法难以仅凭有限、稀疏的拦截观测进行可靠推断。

Method: 构建基于几何可达区域（RR）的模型，区分边界拦截与内部拦截两种情形；采用多起点梯度优化结合定制损失函数进行参数估计；提出几何启发式与贝叶斯实验设计（最大化D-score）两种牺牲代理轨迹选择策略。

Result: 蒙特卡洛实验表明，仅需5–12个牺牲代理即可实现准确的追击者参数恢复；所学模型能成功生成规避所有可行追击区域的时间最优安全路径。

Conclusion: 该学习框架将稀疏二元观测、几何建模与信息驱动轨迹设计有机结合，为资源受限下的追逃态势感知与安全规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based framework for estimating pursuer parameters in turn-rate-limited pursuit-evasion scenarios using sacrificial agents. Each sacrificial agent follows a straight-line trajectory toward an adversary and reports whether it was intercepted or survived. These binary outcomes are related to the pursuer's parameters through a geometric reachable-region (RR) model. Two formulations are introduced: a boundary-interception case, where capture occurs at the RR boundary, and an interior-interception case, which allows capture anywhere within it. The pursuer's parameters are inferred using a gradient-based multi-start optimization with custom loss functions tailored to each case.
  Two trajectory-selection strategies are proposed for the sacrificial agents: a geometric heuristic that maximizes the spread of expected interception points, and a Bayesian experimental-design method that maximizes the D-score of the expected Gauss-Newton information matrix, thereby selecting trajectories that yield maximal information gain. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate accurate parameter recovery with five to twelve sacrificial agents. The learned engagement models are then used to generate safe, time-optimal paths for high-value agents that avoid all feasible pursuer engagement regions.

TL;DR: AsyncVLA提出异步控制框架，分离语义推理与快速响应执行，通过远程大模型提供高层指导、本地轻量模型高频精调动作，并引入端到端微调与轨迹重加权策略，在6秒通信延迟下提升导航成功率40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人基础模型虽具强泛化能力，但高推理延迟破坏动态环境中的实时控制闭环，导致部署不安全。

Method: 提出AsyncVLA异步控制框架：远程运行大视觉语言模型（VLA）进行高层语义推理，本地轻量Edge Adapter高频执行动作；引入端到端微调协议和面向动态交互的轨迹重加权策略以弥合异步模态间域差距。

Result: 在真实世界视觉导航任务中，面对最高6秒通信延迟，AsyncVLA成功率比SOTA基线高40%。

Conclusion: AsyncVLA成功平衡了大模型的语义智能与边缘机器人的实时响应需求，为延迟敏感型机器人系统提供了可行架构。

Abstract: Robotic foundation models achieve strong generalization by leveraging internet-scale vision-language representations, but their massive computational cost creates a fundamental bottleneck: high inference latency. In dynamic environments, this latency breaks the control loop, rendering powerful models unsafe for real-time deployment. We propose AsyncVLA, an asynchronous control framework that decouples semantic reasoning from reactive execution. Inspired by hierarchical control, AsyncVLA runs a large foundation model on a remote workstation to provide high-level guidance, while a lightweight, onboard Edge Adapter continuously refines actions at high frequency. To bridge the domain gap between these asynchronous streams, we introduce an end-to-end finetuning protocol and a trajectory re-weighting strategy that prioritizes dynamic interactions. We evaluate our approach on real-world vision-based navigation tasks with communication delays up to 6 seconds. AsyncVLA achieves a 40% higher success rate than state-of-the-art baselines, effectively bridging the gap between the semantic intelligence of large models and the reactivity required for edge robotics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于占用栅格与占用流预测的实时动态路径规划器，采用改进的自行车模型构建非线性优化问题，在占用空间中实现对静态与动态障碍物的安全避让，具备强噪声鲁棒性与低调参需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态路径规划需在感知噪声、定位不确定性及语义感知不全等现实挑战下保持可靠性。

Method: 构建基于改进自行车模型的空间域非线性规划（NLP），引入显式的可行性与碰撞规避惩罚项；仅依赖占用栅格（可选融合占用流预测），无需障碍物类别信息或运动先验。

Result: 在仿真（高噪声）和F1TENTH实车平台上验证：实时性>10Hz、能安全通过狭窄通道与复杂地形，接口简洁、调参极少。

Conclusion: 该方法为噪声鲁棒、预测感知的规划提供了实用、免启发式设计的基础框架。

Abstract: Dynamic path planning must remain reliable in the presence of sensing noise, uncertain localization, and incomplete semantic perception. We propose a practical, implementation-friendly planner that operates on occupancy grids and optionally incorporates occupancy-flow predictions to generate ego-centric, kinematically feasible paths that safely navigate through static and dynamic obstacles. The core is a nonlinear program in the spatial domain built on a modified bicycle model with explicit feasibility and collision-avoidance penalties. The formulation naturally handles unknown obstacle classes and heterogeneous agent motion by operating purely in occupancy space. The pipeline runs in real-time (faster than 10 Hz on average), requires minimal tuning, and interfaces cleanly with standard control stacks. We validate our approach in simulation with severe localization and perception noises, and on an F1TENTH platform, demonstrating smooth and safe maneuvering through narrow passages and rough routes. The approach provides a robust foundation for noise-resilient, prediction-aware planning, eliminating the need for handcrafted heuristics.

TL;DR: 本文提出TactAlign方法，通过无配对数据的潜空间对齐，将人类穿戴设备采集的触觉信号跨形态迁移至机器人，提升触觉驱动的策略迁移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从人到机器人的触觉迁移方法受限于传感器同构、需配对数据及缺乏对具身差异的建模，难以扩展和泛化。

Method: TactAlign利用修正流（rectified flow）将人类与机器人触觉观测映射到共享潜在表征空间，无需配对数据、人工标注或特权信息，并借助手-物交互生成伪配对实现低成本潜空间传输。

Result: 在多个接触密集型任务（如旋转、插入、关盖）上提升了H2R策略迁移性能；能泛化至未见物体与任务（仅需<5分钟人类数据）；并在高灵巧任务（灯泡拧紧）上实现零样本H2R迁移。

Conclusion: TactAlign有效解决了跨具身触觉信号迁移的关键挑战，显著提升了人类示范向机器人策略学习的可扩展性与实用性。

Abstract: Human demonstrations collected by wearable devices (e.g., tactile gloves) provide fast and dexterous supervision for policy learning, and are guided by rich, natural tactile feedback. However, a key challenge is how to transfer human-collected tactile signals to robots despite the differences in sensing modalities and embodiment. Existing human-to-robot (H2R) approaches that incorporate touch often assume identical tactile sensors, require paired data, and involve little to no embodiment gap between human demonstrator and the robots, limiting scalability and generality. We propose TactAlign, a cross-embodiment tactile alignment method that transfers human-collected tactile signals to a robot with different embodiment. TactAlign transforms human and robot tactile observations into a shared latent representation using a rectified flow, without paired datasets, manual labels, or privileged information. Our method enables low-cost latent transport guided by hand-object interaction-derived pseudo-pairs. We demonstrate that TactAlign improves H2R policy transfer across multiple contact-rich tasks (pivoting, insertion, lid closing), generalizes to unseen objects and tasks with human data (less than 5 minutes), and enables zero-shot H2R transfer on a highly dexterous tasks (light bulb screwing).

TL;DR: 本文提出AgentRob框架，通过Model Context Protocol（MCP）连接在线论坛、大语言模型代理与物理机器人，实现代理在论坛中读取自然语言指令、调用机器人执行并反馈结果的闭环，支持多代理、多实体协同的论坛中介式机器人编排。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的自主代理主要局限于虚拟环境，与物理世界的交互仍限于直接控制接口，缺乏在开放、异步、社区驱动场景下的具身协同机制。

Method: 提出三层架构的AgentRob框架：论坛层（提供异步持久化多代理交互）、代理层（基于@mention监听并解析自然语言指令）、机器人层（利用VLM驱动Unitree Go2/G1机器人，通过迭代工具调用将指令转化为机器人动作）。核心依托Model Context Protocol（MCP）实现跨层语义对齐与通信。

Result: 成功实现了多个具有不同身份和物理形态的自主代理在同一个在线论坛中共存与协作；验证了论坛作为中介平台进行多机器人任务分发、执行与反馈的可行性；在真实硬件（Unitree Go2/G1）上完成端到端指令理解与执行闭环。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered autonomous agents have demonstrated significant capabilities in virtual environments, yet their integration with the physical world remains narrowly confined to direct control interfaces. We present AgentRob, a framework that bridges online community forums, LLM-powered agents, and physical robots through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). AgentRob enables a novel paradigm where autonomous agents participate in online forums--reading posts, extracting natural language commands, dispatching physical robot actions, and reporting results back to the community. The system comprises three layers: a Forum Layer providing asynchronous, persistent, multi-agent interaction; an Agent Layer with forum agents that poll for @mention-targeted commands; and a Robot Layer with VLM-driven controllers and Unitree Go2/G1 hardware that translate commands into robot primitives via iterative tool calling. The framework supports multiple concurrent agents with distinct identities and physical embodiments coexisting in the same forum, establishing the feasibility of forum-mediated multi-agent robot orchestration.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分层多模态融合框架，利用声学信号作为主导模态来条件化视觉和本体感觉表征，并建模高阶跨模态交互，结合扩散策略实现端到端的机器人操作控制，在倒液体、开柜子等真实任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人操作方法依赖视觉和本体感觉，难以在部分可观测环境中推断接触状态；声学信号天然富含接触动力学信息，但未被充分利用；主流多模态融合假设各模态角色均质，不适用于稀疏、接触驱动的声学信号。

Method: 提出分层表示融合框架：首先以声学线索为条件调制视觉与本体感觉表征，再显式建模三者间的高阶跨模态交互；融合表征输入扩散策略网络，直接生成连续机器人动作；端到端训练。

Result: 在真实机器人任务（如液体倾倒、柜门开启）上显著超越当前最优多模态融合方法，尤其在视觉信息不足而声学信息关键的场景下优势明显；互信息分析验证了声学线索的有效性。

Conclusion: 声学信号可作为引导多模态融合的关键模态，分层融合结构能更有效地提取和利用任务相关声学信息，提升部分可观测环境下机器人操作的鲁棒性与精度。

Abstract: Existing robotic manipulation methods primarily rely on visual and proprioceptive observations, which may struggle to infer contact-related interaction states in partially observable real-world environments. Acoustic cues, by contrast, naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact, yet remain underexploited in current multimodal fusion literature. Most multimodal fusion approaches implicitly assume homogeneous roles across modalities, and thus design flat and symmetric fusion structures. However, this assumption is ill-suited for acoustic signals, which are inherently sparse and contact-driven. To achieve precise robotic manipulation through acoustic-informed perception, we propose a hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. Our approach first conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, and then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies among modalities. The fused representation is leveraged by a diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. The combination of end-to-end learning and hierarchical fusion structure enables the policy to exploit task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities. The proposed method has been evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including liquid pouring and cabinet opening. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone. Furthermore, a mutual information analysis is conducted to interpret the effect of audio cues in robotic manipulation via multimodal fusion.

TL;DR: 本文提出SPLIT框架，通过模型分解、局部增量学习和高斯过程稀疏化，解决车辆动力学建模中GP残差模型的维度灾难、计算复杂度高和在线学习效率低等问题，显著提升实时控制中的建模精度、自适应性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GP残差模型在车辆动力学建模中面临维度灾难、高评估复杂度和在线学习效率低的问题，阻碍其在实时自动驾驶控制器中的部署。

Method: 提出SPLIT稀疏增量学习框架，包含三方面创新：(i) 模型分解——将车辆模型分为实验标定的不变部分与残差补偿的可变部分以降低特征维数；(ii) 局部增量学习——在特征空间定义有效区域并划分子区，支持流式数据的高效在线学习；(iii) GP稀疏化——采用贝叶斯委员会机实现可扩展的在线评估。

Result: SPLIT集成于基于模型的控制器，在激进仿真和实车实验中验证：提升了模型精度与控制性能，支持对车辆动力学偏差的快速在线适应，并对未见过的场景表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPLIT为面向控制的车辆动力学建模提供了高效、自适应且可部署的解决方案，克服了传统GP残差建模的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Accurate, computationally efficient, and adaptive vehicle models are essential for autonomous vehicle control. Hybrid models that combine a nominal model with a Gaussian Process (GP)-based residual model have emerged as a promising approach. However, the GP-based residual model suffers from the curse of dimensionality, high evaluation complexity, and the inefficiency of online learning, which impede the deployment in real-time vehicle controllers. To address these challenges, we propose SPLIT, a sparse incremental learning framework for control-oriented vehicle dynamics modeling. SPLIT integrates three key innovations: (i) Model Decomposition. We decompose the vehicle model into invariant elements calibrated by experiments, and variant elements compensated by the residual model to reduce feature dimensionality. (ii) Local Incremental Learning. We define the valid region in the feature space and partition it into subregions, enabling efficient online learning from streaming data. (iii) GP Sparsification. We use bayesian committee machine to ensure scalable online evaluation. Integrated into model-based controllers, SPLIT is evaluated in aggressive simulations and real-vehicle experiments. Results demonstrate that SPLIT improves model accuracy and control performance online. Moreover, it enables rapid adaptation to vehicle dynamics deviations and exhibits robust generalization to previously unseen scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文构建了KungFuAthlete高动态武术动作数据集，并提出一种新训练范式，使单一策略能同时学习高动态动作跟踪与跌倒恢复，提升人形机器人在真实高动态场景下的鲁棒性与自主性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动跟踪系统在硬件极限和算法鲁棒性边界附近表现不足；武术动作代表极端高动态人体运动，但缺乏相应高质量数据集；同时，当前方法缺乏对不安全状态建模及自主恢复的统一策略。

Method: 构建专业运动员日常训练视频驱动的KungFuAthlete数据集（含地面与跳跃子集），并提出联合学习高动态运动跟踪与跌倒恢复的单一策略训练范式。

Result: KungFuAthlete跳跃子集的关节、线性和角速度显著高于LAFAN1、PHUMA和AMASS等常用数据集；所提框架实现了运动跟踪与自主恢复的统一，提升了机器人在扰动或执行错误下的稳定性。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了高动态运动数据与算法范式的双重空白，推动人形机器人从单纯动作复现迈向具备恢复能力的真正自主执行。

Abstract: Current humanoid motion tracking systems can execute routine and moderately dynamic behaviors, yet significant gaps remain near hardware performance limits and algorithmic robustness boundaries. Martial arts represent an extreme case of highly dynamic human motion, characterized by rapid center-of-mass shifts, complex coordination, and abrupt posture transitions. However, datasets tailored to such high-intensity scenarios remain scarce. To address this gap, we construct KungFuAthlete, a high-dynamic martial arts motion dataset derived from professional athletes' daily training videos. The dataset includes ground and jump subsets covering representative complex motion patterns. The jump subset exhibits substantially higher joint, linear, and angular velocities compared to commonly used datasets such as LAFAN1, PHUMA, and AMASS, indicating significantly increased motion intensity and complexity. Importantly, even professional athletes may fail during highly dynamic movements. Similarly, humanoid robots are prone to instability and falls under external disturbances or execution errors. Most prior work assumes motion execution remains within safe states and lacks a unified strategy for modeling unsafe states and enabling reliable autonomous recovery. We propose a novel training paradigm that enables a single policy to jointly learn high-dynamic motion tracking and fall recovery, unifying agile execution and stabilization within one framework. This framework expands robotic capability from pure motion tracking to recovery-enabled execution, promoting more robust and autonomous humanoid performance in real-world high-dynamic scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 插入类操作需要高精度、接触丰富的交互，仅靠视觉难以完成；尽管触觉直观有用，但现有简单视听触融合方法效果不稳定，亟需更鲁棒、有原则的多模态融合机制。

Method: 提出跨模态Transformer（CMT），融合腕部相机图像与触觉信号；引入物理启发的对称性正则化（鼓励双侧力平衡），以稳定触觉嵌入并符合人类运动控制原理。

Result: 在TacSL基准上，CMT+对称正则化实现96.59%插入成功率，显著优于朴素融合和门控融合基线，并接近‘腕部视觉+接触力’这一特权配置的96.09%。

Conclusion: 触觉感知对精确对齐不可或缺；而遵循物理先验的结构化多模态融合能有效释放视觉与触觉的互补优势，在现实传感条件下逼近特权性能。

Abstract: Insertion tasks in robotic manipulation demand precise, contact-rich interactions that vision alone cannot resolve. While tactile feedback is intuitively valuable, existing studies have shown that naïve visuo-tactile fusion often fails to deliver consistent improvements. In this work, we propose a Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) for visuo-tactile fusion that integrates wrist-camera observations with tactile signals through structured self- and cross-attention. To stabilize tactile embeddings, we further introduce a physics-informed regularization that encourages bilateral force balance, reflecting principles of human motor control. Experiments on the TacSL benchmark show that CMT with symmetry regularization achieves a 96.59% insertion success rate, surpassing naïve and gated fusion baselines and closely matching the privileged "wrist + contact force" configuration (96.09%). These results highlight two central insights: (i) tactile sensing is indispensable for precise alignment, and (ii) principled multimodal fusion, further strengthened by physics-informed regularization, unlocks complementary strengths of vision and touch, approaching privileged performance under realistic sensing.

TL;DR: 本文提出HybridFlow，一种三阶段、仅需2次函数评估（2-NFE）的快速动作生成方法，显著提升机器人操作策略的实时交互能力，在保持高成功率的同时实现约8倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人操作策略受限于推理延迟，难以实现实时环境交互；虽有Flow Matching等更快生成方法，但仍需进一步提速以满足交互式机器人控制需求；MeanFlow虽快但动作精度不足。

Method: 提出HybridFlow：三阶段方法，包括MeanFlow模式下的全局跳跃（Global Jump）、用于分布对齐的ReNoise、以及ReFlow模式下的局部精修（Local Refine），总计仅需2次函数评估（2-NFE）。

Result: 在真实实验中，相比16步Diffusion Policy，成功率提升15–25%，推理时间从152ms降至19ms（8×加速，~52Hz）；在未见颜色OOD抓取任务中达70.0%成功率，在可变形物体折叠任务中达66.3%成功率。

Conclusion: HybridFlow是一种兼顾速度与精度的低延迟动作生成方法，有望显著增强机器人操作策略在真实世界中的实时交互能力。

Abstract: Limited by inference latency, existing robot manipulation policies lack sufficient real-time interaction capability with the environment. Although faster generation methods such as flow matching are gradually replacing diffusion methods, researchers are pursuing even faster generation suitable for interactive robot control. MeanFlow, as a one-step variant of flow matching, has shown strong potential in image generation, but its precision in action generation does not meet the stringent requirements of robotic manipulation. We therefore propose \textbf{HybridFlow}, a \textbf{3-stage method} with \textbf{2-NFE}: Global Jump in MeanFlow mode, ReNoise for distribution alignment, and Local Refine in ReFlow mode. This method balances inference speed and generation quality by leveraging the rapid advantage of MeanFlow one-step generation while ensuring action precision with minimal generation steps. Through real-world experiments, HybridFlow outperforms the 16-step Diffusion Policy by \textbf{15--25\%} in success rate while reducing inference time from 152ms to 19ms (\textbf{8$\times$ speedup}, \textbf{$\sim$52Hz}); it also achieves 70.0\% success on unseen-color OOD grasping and 66.3\% on deformable object folding. We envision HybridFlow as a practical low-latency method to enhance real-world interaction capabilities of robotic manipulation policies.

Motivation: 现有自主空中扫描方法侧重避障与效率，但忽视遮挡导致的可见性下降，严重影响扫描质量。

Method: 提出可见性感知的在线重规划框架FC-Vision，采用两层分解策略：先进行无遮挡视角修复以最小偏离原扫描意图维持覆盖率，再在5自由度空间中分段构建清洁感知连接；并设计即插即用集成方式兼容现有系统。

Result: 仿真与真实实验表明，FC-Vision在突发遮挡下显著提升扫描质量，最大覆盖率提升55.32%，遮挡比降低73.17%，且保持实时性，仅小幅增加飞行时间。

Conclusion: FC-Vision有效解决了动态环境中的目标遮挡问题，在不改变原有系统架构前提下，实现了高质量、高鲁棒性的自主空中扫描。

Abstract: Autonomous aerial scanning of target structures is crucial for practical applications, requiring online adaptation to unknown obstacles during flight. Existing methods largely emphasize collision avoidance and efficiency, but overlook occlusion-induced visibility degradation, severely compromising scanning quality. In this study, we propose FC-Vision, an on-the-fly visibility-aware replanning framework that proactively and safely prevents target occlusions while preserving the intended coverage and efficiency of the original plan. Our approach explicitly enforces dense surface-visibility constraints to regularize replanning behavior in real-time via an efficient two-level decomposition: occlusion-free viewpoint repair that maintains coverage with minimal deviation from the nominal scan intent, followed by segment-wise clean-sensing connection in 5-DoF space. A plug-in integration strategy is also presented to seamlessly interface FC-Vision with existing UAV scanning systems without architectural changes. Comprehensive simulation and real-world evaluations show that FC-Vision consistently improves scanning quality under unexpected occluders, delivering a maximum coverage gain of 55.32% and a 73.17% reduction in the occlusion ratio, while achieving real-time performance with a moderate increase in flight time. The source code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该算法能有效利用驾驶员主动接管中的隐式反馈，实现PLDF的实时个性化调整，提升人机协同驾驶体验与系统接受度。

Abstract: During the use of advanced driver assistance systems, drivers frequently intervene into the active driving function and adjust the system's behavior to their personal wishes. These active driver-initiated takeovers contain feedback about deviations in the driving function's behavior from the drivers' personal preferences. This feedback should be utilized to optimize and personalize the driving function's behavior. In this work, the adjustment of the speed profile of a Predictive Longitudinal Driving Function (PLDF) on a pre-defined route is highlighted. An algorithm is introduced which iteratively adjusts the PLDF's speed profile by taking into account both the original speed profile of the PLDF and the driver demonstration. This approach allows for personalization in a traded control scenario during active use of the PLDF. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is tested in a driving simulator-based test group study with 43 participants. The study finds a significant increase in driver satisfaction and a significant reduction in the intervention frequency when using the proposed adaptive PLDF. Additionally, feedback by the participants was gathered to identify further optimization potentials of the proposed system.

Abstract: Mobile robotic gas distribution mapping (GDM) provides critical situational awareness during emergency responses to hazardous gas releases. However, most systems still rely on teleoperation, limiting scalability and response speed. Autonomous active GDM is challenging in unknown and cluttered environments, because the robot must simultaneously explore traversable space, map the environment, and infer the gas distribution belief from sparse chemical measurements. We address this by formulating active GDM as a next-best-trajectory informative path planning (IPP) problem and propose XIT (Exploration-Exploitation Informed Trees), a sampling-based planner that balances exploration and exploitation by generating concurrent trajectories toward exploration-rich goals while collecting informative gas measurements en route. XIT draws batches of samples from an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) information field derived from the current gas posterior and expands trees using a cost that trades off travel effort against gas concentration and uncertainty. To enable plume-aware exploration, we introduce the gas frontier concept, defined as unobserved regions adjacent to high gas concentrations, and propose the Wavefront Gas Frontier Detection (WGFD) algorithm for their identification. High-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the benefits of XIT in terms of GDM quality and efficiency. Although developed for active GDM, XIT is readily applicable to other robotic information-gathering tasks in unknown environments that face the exploration and exploitation trade-off.

Abstract: It has long been realized that neuromorphic hardware offers benefits for the domain of robotics such as low energy, low latency, as well as unique methods of learning. In aiming for more complex tasks, especially those incorporating multimodal data, one hurdle continuing to prevent their realization is an inability to orchestrate multiple networks on neuromorphic hardware without resorting to off-chip process management logic. To address this, we show a first example of a pipeline for vision-based robot control in which numerous complex networks can be run entirely on hardware via the use of a spiking neural state machine for process orchestration. The pipeline is validated on the Intel Loihi 2 research chip. We show that all components can run concurrently on-chip in the milli Watt regime at latencies competitive with the state-of-the-art. An equivalent network on simulated hardware is shown to accomplish robotic arm plug insertion in simulation, and the core elements of the pipeline are additionally tested on a real robotic arm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对运动学冗余力矩控制机器人在冲击下的姿态优化新方法，通过最小化冲击前后速度变化的配置相关度量，提升鲁棒性与安全性，并嵌入任务空间逆动力学（TSID）控制器中验证了有效性。

Abstract: We present a novel method for optimizing the posture of kinematically redundant torque-controlled robots to improve robustness during impacts. A rigid impact model is used as the basis for a configuration-dependent metric that quantifies the variation between pre- and post-impact velocities. By finding configurations (postures) that minimize the aforementioned metric, spikes in the robot's state and input commands can be significantly reduced during impacts, improving safety and robustness. The problem of identifying impact-robust postures is posed as a min-max optimization of the aforementioned metric. To overcome the real-time intractability of the problem, we reformulate it as a gradient-based motion task that iteratively guides the robot towards configurations that minimize the proposed metric. This task is embedded within a task-space inverse dynamics (TSID) whole-body controller, enabling seamless integration with other control objectives. The method is applied to a kinematically redundant aerial manipulator performing repeated point contact tasks. We test our method inside a realistic physics simulator and compare it with the nominal TSID. Our method leads to a reduction (up to 51% w.r.t. standard TSID) of post-impact spikes in the robot's configuration and successfully avoids actuator saturation. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of kinematic redundancy for impact robustness using additional numerical simulations on a quadruped and a humanoid robot, resulting in up to 45% reduction of post-impact spikes in the robot's state w.r.t. nominal TSID.

Abstract: Deploying heterogeneous robot teams to accomplish multiple tasks over extended time horizons presents significant computational challenges for task allocation and planning. In this paper, we present a comprehensive, time-extended, offline heterogeneous multi-robot task allocation framework, TRAITS, which we believe to be the first that can cope with the provisioning of exhaustible traits under battery and temporal constraints. Specifically, we introduce a nonlinear programming-based trait distribution module that can optimize the trait-provisioning rate of coalitions to yield feasible and time-efficient solutions. TRAITS provides a more accurate feasibility assessment and estimation of task execution times and makespan by leveraging trait-provisioning rates while optimizing battery consumption -- an advantage that state-of-the-art frameworks lack. We evaluate TRAITS against two state-of-the-art frameworks, with results demonstrating its advantage in satisfying complex trait and battery requirements while remaining computationally tractable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨本体策略受限于私有参数容量小、缺乏显式适应机制，且收集足够真实世界演示成本高。

Conclusion: MOTIF有效解决了跨本体迁移中动作表征不一致与适应能力弱的问题，实现了高效、鲁棒的少样本迁移。

Abstract: While vision-language-action (VLA) models have advanced generalist robotic learning, cross-embodiment transfer remains challenging due to kinematic heterogeneity and the high cost of collecting sufficient real-world demonstrations to support fine-tuning. Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments. Evaluations across both simulation and real-world environments validate the superiority of MOTIF, which significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings.

Abstract: Building effective human-robot interaction requires robots to derive conclusions from their experiences that are both logically sound and communicated in ways aligned with human expectations. This paper presents a hybrid framework that blends ontology-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) to produce semantically grounded and natural robot explanations. Ontologies ensure logical consistency and domain grounding, while LLMs provide fluent, context-aware and adaptive language generation. The proposed method grounds data from human-robot experiences, enabling robots to reason about whether events are typical or atypical based on their properties. We integrate a state-of-the-art algorithm for retrieving and constructing static contrastive ontology-based narratives with an LLM agent that uses them to produce concise, clear, interactive explanations. The approach is validated through a laboratory study replicating an industrial collaborative task. Empirical results show significant improvements in the clarity and brevity of ontology-based narratives while preserving their semantic accuracy. Initial evaluations further demonstrate the system's ability to adapt explanations to user feedback. Overall, this work highlights the potential of ontology-LLM integration to advance explainable agency, and promote more transparent human-robot collaboration.

TL;DR: 本文提出Semantic-Contact Fields（SCFields），一种融合视觉语义与密集接触估计的统一3D表示，并通过两阶段仿真到现实的接触学习流程，实现对未见工具的物理泛化能力，显著提升接触密集型工具操作任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用机器人策略缺乏高保真物理接地能力，而接触感知策略又难以跨不同工具几何结构泛化；同时，大规模真实触觉数据获取困难，且零样本仿真到现实迁移因软传感器非线性形变复杂而受限。

Method: 提出Semantic-Contact Fields（SCFields）作为统一3D接触表示，并构建两阶段Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline：第一阶段在大规模仿真数据上预训练以学习通用接触物理；第二阶段利用几何启发式和力优化对少量真实数据进行伪标签并微调，以对齐传感器特性；最后将SCFields作为扩散策略的密集观测输入。

Result: 在刮擦、蜡笔绘画和剥离等任务中实现了鲁棒的类别级泛化，性能显著优于纯视觉和原始触觉基线方法。

Conclusion: SCFields有效弥合了语义规划与物理控制之间的鸿沟，为接触密集型工具操作提供了可泛化的物理表征与策略框架。

Abstract: Generalizing tool manipulation requires both semantic planning and precise physical control. Modern generalist robot policies, such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, often lack the high-fidelity physical grounding required for contact-rich tool manipulation. Conversely, existing contact-aware policies that leverage tactile or haptic sensing are typically instance-specific and fail to generalize across diverse tool geometries. Bridging this gap requires learning unified contact representations from diverse data, yet a fundamental barrier remains: diverse real-world tactile data are prohibitive at scale, while direct zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to the complex dynamics of nonlinear deformation of soft sensors.
  To address this, we propose Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields), a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. We enable this via a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: first, we pre-train on a large simulation data set to learn general contact physics; second, we fine-tune on a small set of real data, pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization, to align sensor characteristics. This allows physical generalization to unseen tools. We leverage SCFields as the dense observation input for a diffusion policy to enable robust execution of contact-rich tool manipulation tasks. Experiments on scraping, crayon drawing, and peeling demonstrate robust category-level generalization, significantly outperforming vision-only and raw-tactile baselines.

Abstract: This study proposes an intelligent multi-agent framework built on LLMs and VLMs and specifically tailored to robotics. The goal is to integrate the strengths of LLMs and VLMs with computational tools to automatically analyze and solve problems related to robotic manipulators. Our developed framework accepts both textual and visual inputs and can automatically perform forward and inverse kinematics, compute velocities and accelerations of key points, generate 3D simulations of the robot, and ultimately execute motion control within the simulated environment, all according to the user's query. To evaluate the framework, three benchmark tests were designed, each consisting of ten questions. In the first benchmark test, the framework was evaluated while connected to GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3.2, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5, as well as their corresponding raw models. The objective was to extract the forward kinematics of robots directly from textual descriptions. The results showed that the framework integrated with GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 0.97 in computing the final solution, whereas the raw model alone attained an accuracy of only 0.30 for the same task. Similarly, for the other two models, the framework consistently outperformed the corresponding raw models in terms of accuracy. The second benchmark test was identical to the first, except that the input was provided in visual form. In this test, the GPT-4o LLM was used alongside the Gemini 2.5 Pro VLM. The results showed that the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.93 in obtaining the final answer, which is approximately 20% higher than that of the corresponding raw model. The third benchmark test encompassed a range of robotic tasks, including simulation, control, velocity and acceleration computation, as well as inverse kinematics and Jacobian calculation, for which the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.97.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'push-placement', a hybrid action that combines grasping and pushing to improve tabletop rearrangement efficiency by reducing the need for explicit buffering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient tabletop rearrangement is challenging due to collisions and the need for temporary buffering when target poses are obstructed; prehensile methods are precise but inefficient, while non-prehensile pushing is efficient but imprecise.

Method: The paper proposes 'push-placement', a hybrid primitive where a grasped object displaces obstructing items during placement, integrated into a physics-in-the-loop Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner.

Result: Empirical results in PyBullet show push-placement reduces manipulator travel cost by up to 11.12% versus baseline MCTS and 8.56% versus dynamic stacking.

Conclusion: Hybrid prehensile/non-prehensile action primitives like push-placement can substantially improve efficiency in long-horizon rearrangement tasks.

Abstract: Efficient tabletop rearrangement remains challenging due to collisions and the need for temporary buffering when target poses are obstructed. Prehensile pick-and-place provides precise control but often requires extra moves, whereas non-prehensile pushing can be more efficient but suffers from complex, imprecise dynamics. This paper proposes push-placement, a hybrid action primitive that uses the grasped object to displace obstructing items while being placed, thereby reducing explicit buffering. The method is integrated into a physics-in-the-loop Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and evaluated in the PyBullet simulator. Empirical results show push-placement reduces the manipulator travel cost by up to 11.12% versus a baseline MCTS planner and 8.56% versus dynamic stacking. These findings indicate that hybrid prehensile/non-prehensile action primitives can substantially improve efficiency in long-horizon rearrangement tasks.

Abstract: We investigate a skill-based framework for humanoid box rearrangement that enables long-horizon execution by sequencing reusable skills at the task level. In our architecture, all skills execute through a shared, task-agnostic whole-body controller (WBC), providing a consistent closed-loop interface for skill composition, in contrast to non-shared designs that use separate low-level controllers per skill. We find that naively reusing the same pretrained WBC can reduce robustness over long horizons, as new skills and their compositions induce shifted state and command distributions. We address this with a simple data aggregation procedure that augments shared-WBC training with rollouts from closed-loop skill execution under domain randomization. To evaluate the approach, we introduce \emph{Humanoid Hanoi}, a long-horizon Tower-of-Hanoi box rearrangement benchmark, and report results in simulation and on the Digit V3 humanoid robot, demonstrating fully autonomous rearrangement over extended horizons and quantifying the benefits of the shared-WBC approach over non-shared baselines.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for ensuring reliable and safe operation, as anomalies occurring during mission execution may induce discrepancies between expected and observed system behaviors, thereby compromising mission success or posing potential safety hazards. It is essential to continuously monitor and detect such conditions in order to ensure a timely response and maintain system reliability. In this work, we focus on UAV state estimation anomalies and provide a large-scale real-world UAV dataset to facilitate research aimed at improving the development of anomaly detection. Unlike existing datasets that primarily rely on injected faults into simulated data, this dataset comprises 1396 real flight logs totaling over 52 hours of flight time, collected across diverse indoor and outdoor environments using a collection of PX4-based UAVs equipped with a variety of sensor configurations. The dataset comprises both normal and anomalous flights without synthetic manipulation, making it uniquely suitable for realistic anomaly detection tasks. A structured classification is proposed that categorizes UAV state estimation anomalies into four classes: mechanical and electrical, external position, global position, and altitude anomalies. These classifications reflect collective, contextual, and outlier anomalies observed in multivariate sensor data streams, including IMU, GPS, barometer, magnetometer, distance sensors, visual odometry, and optical flow, that can be found in the PX4 logging mechanism. It is anticipated that this dataset will play a key role in the development, training, and evaluation of anomaly detection and isolation systems to address the critical gap in UAV reliability research.

Abstract: Planetary exploration increasingly relies on autonomous robotic systems capable of perceiving, interpreting, and reconstructing their surroundings in the absence of global positioning or real-time communication with Earth. Rovers operating on planetary surfaces must navigate under sever environmental constraints, limited visual redundancy, and communication delays, making onboard spatial awareness and visual localization key components for mission success. Traditional techniques based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) provide geometric consistency but struggle to capture radiometric detail or to scale efficiently in unstructured, low-texture terrains typical of extraterrestrial environments. This work explores the integration of radiance field-based methods - specifically Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting - into a unified, automated environment reconstruction pipeline for planetary robotics. Our system combines the Nerfstudio and COLMAP frameworks with a ROS2-compatible workflow capable of processing raw rover data directly from rosbag recordings. This approach enables the generation of dense, photorealistic, and metrically consistent 3D representations from minimal visual input, supporting improved perception and planning for autonomous systems operating in planetary-like conditions. The resulting pipeline established a foundation for future research in radiance field-based mapping, bridging the gap between geometric and neural representations in planetary exploration.

Abstract: We introduce and study the Joint Task Assistance Planning problem which generalizes prior work on optimizing assistance in robotic collaboration. In this setting, two robots operate over predefined roadmaps, each represented as a graph corresponding to its configuration space. One robot, the task robot, must execute a timed mission, while the other, the assistance robot, provides sensor-based support that depends on their spatial relationship. The objective is to compute a path for both robots that maximizes the total duration of assistance given. Solving this problem is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible path combinations together with the temporal nature of the problem (time needs to be accounted for as well). To address this, we propose a nested branch-and-bound framework that efficiently explores the space of robot paths in a hierarchical manner. We empirically evaluate our algorithm and demonstrate a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude when compared to a baseline approach.

Conclusion: 当幻觉被显式控制时，学习到的世界模型可作为 RL 的实用仿真器，为 VLA 模型的后训练强化学习提供可靠路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.

We argue that this decoupling is a fundamental bottleneck, masking the critical dependencies between high-level dispatching and low-level congestion. Existing simulators fail to bridge this gap, often abstracting away heterogeneous kinematics and stochastic execution failures. We propose WareRover, a holistic simulation platform that enforces a tight coupling between OS and MAPF via a unified, closed-loop optimization interface. Unlike standard benchmarks, WareRover integrates dynamic order streams, physics-aware motion constraints, and non-nominal recovery mechanisms into a single evaluation loop. Experiments reveal that SOTA algorithms often falter under these realistic coupled constraints, demonstrating that WareRover provides a necessary and challenging testbed for robust, next-generation warehouse coordination.

Conclusion: RoboAug大幅降低对大规模预训练和完美视觉识别的依赖，在真实世界操作任务中展现出卓越的泛化性与有效性。

Abstract: Enhancing the generalization capability of robotic learning to enable robots to operate effectively in diverse, unseen scenes is a fundamental and challenging problem. Existing approaches often depend on pretraining with large-scale data collection, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming, or on semantic data augmentation techniques that necessitate an impractical assumption of flawless upstream object detection in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboAug, a novel generative data augmentation framework that significantly minimizes the reliance on large-scale pretraining and the perfect visual recognition assumption by requiring only the bounding box annotation of a single image during training. Leveraging this minimal information, RoboAug employs pre-trained generative models for precise semantic data augmentation and integrates a plug-and-play region-contrastive loss to help models focus on task-relevant regions, thereby improving generalization and boosting task success rates. We conduct extensive real-world experiments on three robots, namely UR-5e, AgileX, and Tien Kung 2.0, spanning over 35k rollouts. Empirical results demonstrate that RoboAug significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation baselines. Specifically, when evaluating generalization capabilities in unseen scenes featuring diverse combinations of backgrounds, distractors, and lighting conditions, our method achieves substantial gains over the baseline without augmentation. The success rates increase from 0.09 to 0.47 on UR-5e, from 0.16 to 0.60 on AgileX, and from 0.19 to 0.67 on Tien Kung 2.0. These results highlight the superior generalization and effectiveness of RoboAug in real-world manipulation tasks. Our project is available at https://x-roboaug.github.io/.

We present SemanticFeels, an extension of the NeuralFeels framework that integrates semantic labeling with neural implicit shape representation, from vision and touch. To illustrate its application, we focus on material classification: high-resolution Digit tactile readings are processed by a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate local material predictions, which are then embedded into an augmented signed distance field (SDF) network that jointly predicts geometry and continuous material regions. Experimental results show that the system achieves a high correspondence between predicted and actual materials on both single- and multi-material objects, with an average matching accuracy of 79.87% across multiple manipulation trials on a multi-material object.

Abstract: Precise in-hand manipulation of force-sensitive objects typically requires judicious coordinated force planning as well as accurate contact force feedback and control. Unlike multi-arm platforms with gripper end effectors, multi-fingered hands rely solely on fingertip point contacts and are not able to apply pull forces, therefore poses a more challenging problem. Furthermore, calibrated torque sensors are lacking in most commercial dexterous hands, adding to the difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-layer framework for multi-finger coordination, enabling high-precision manipulation of force-sensitive objects through joint control without tactile feedback. This approach solves coordinated contact force planning by incorporating graph rigidity and force closure constraints. By employing a force-to-position mapping, the planned force trajectory is converted to a joint trajectory. We validate the framework on a custom dexterous hand, demonstrating the capability to manipulate fragile objects-including a soft yarn, a plastic cup, and a raw egg-with high precision and safety.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer for contact-rich manipulation remains challenging due to the inherent discrepancy in contact dynamics. While existing methods often rely on costly real-world data or utilize blind compliance through fixed controllers, we propose a framework that leverages expert-designed controller logic for transfer. Inspired by the success of privileged supervision in kinematic tasks, we employ a human-designed finite state machine based position/force controller in simulation to provide privileged guidance. The resulting policy is trained to predict the end-effector pose, contact state, and crucially the desired contact force direction. Unlike force magnitudes, which are highly sensitive to simulation inaccuracies, force directions encode high-level task geometry and remain robust across the sim-to-real gap. At deployment, these predictions configure a force-aware admittance controller. By combining the policy's directional intent with a constant, low-cost manually tuned force magnitude, the system generates adaptive, task-aligned compliance. This tuning is lightweight, typically requiring only a single scalar per contact state. We provide theoretical analysis for stability and robustness to disturbances. Experiments on four real-world tasks, i.e., microwave opening, peg-in-hole, whiteboard wiping, and door opening, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines in both success rate and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向可泛化铰接物体操作的Part-Aware 3D Feature Field（PA3FF），通过对比学习从大规模3D部件标注数据中学习具备部件感知能力的稠密三维特征场，并基于此构建了Part-Aware Diffusion Policy（PADP）策略框架，在仿真与真实机器人任务中显著提升了泛化性与样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于2D基础模型的特征难以直接迁移至3D空间，存在运行时间长、多视角不一致、空间分辨率低及几何信息不足等问题；而理解功能部件（如门把手）是实现跨物体类别泛化的关键。

Conclusion: PA3FF为铰接物体操作提供了具备功能部件感知能力的高质量3D基础特征，有效提升了机器人操作的泛化性、样本效率与方法通用性。

Abstract: Articulated object manipulation is essential for various real-world robotic tasks, yet generalizing across diverse objects remains a major challenge. A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多旋翼控制分配多依赖启发式调参或黑箱算法，缺乏对能量经济性与运动就绪性之间根本张力的理论理解；本文旨在从几何与物理建模出发，建立具有解释力的基础框架。

Result: 发现promptness与能耗的权衡具有纤维依赖性：单向推力器下可行纤维紧致，Pareto最优弧短且对称性被扭矩需求打破；可逆螺旋桨下零空间支持拮抗式共收缩，使promptness达硬件极限，导致最优续航与敏捷性根本不可兼得。

Conclusion: 该框架超越经验调优，为多旋翼的敏捷性实现提供了基于几何的原理性解释，可指导飞行器设计、适航认证指标制定及威胁感知飞行操作。

Abstract: In robotics and human biomechanics, the tension between energy economy and kinematic readiness is well recognized; this work brings that fundamental principle to aerial multirotors. We show that the limited torque of the motors and the nonlinear aerodynamic map from rotor speed to thrust naturally give rise to the novel concept of promptness-a metric akin to dynamic aerodynamic manipulability. By treating energy consumption as a competing objective and introducing a geometric fiber-bundle formulation, we turn redundancy resolution into a principled multi-objective program on affine fibers. The use of the diffeomorphic transformation linearizing the signed-quadratic propulsion model allows us to lay the foundations for a rigorous study of the interplay between these costs. Through an illustrative case study on 4-DoF allocation on the hexarotor, we reveal that this interplay is fiber-dependent and physically shaped by hardware inequalities. For unidirectional thrusters, the feasible fibers are compact, yielding interior allocations and a short Pareto arc, while torque demands break symmetry and separate the optima. Conversely, with reversible propellers, the null space enables antagonistic rotor co-contraction that drives promptness to hardware limits, making optimal endurance and agility fundamentally incompatible in those regimes. Ultimately, rather than relying on heuristic tuning or black box algorithms to empirically improve task execution, this framework provides a foundational understanding of why and how to achieve agility through geometry-aware control allocation, offering possible guidance for vehicle design, certification metrics, and threat-aware flight operation.

Abstract: A networked aerial robot team (NART) comprises a group of agents (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ground control stations, etc.) interconnected by wireless links. Inter-agent connectivity, even if intermittent (i.e. sparse), enables data exchanges between agents and supports cooperative behaviours in several NART missions. It can benefit online decentralised decision-making and group resilience, particularly when prior knowledge is inaccurate or incomplete. These requirements can be accounted for in the offline mission planning stages to incentivise cooperative behaviours and improve mission efficiency during the NART deployment. This paper proposes a novel path planning tool for a Sparse, Aware, and Cooperative Networked Aerial Robot Team (SpArC-NART) in exploration missions. It simultaneously considers different levels of prior information regarding the environment, limited agent energy, sensing, and communication, as well as distinct NART constitutions. The communication model takes into account the limitations of user-defined radio technology and physical phenomena. The proposed tool aims to maximise the mission goals (e.g., finding one or multiple targets, covering the full area of the environment, etc.), while cooperating with other agents to reduce agent reporting times, increase their global situational awareness (e.g., their knowledge of the environment), and facilitate mission replanning, if required. The developed cooperation mechanism leverages soft-motion constraints and dynamic rewards based on the Value of Movement and the expected communication availability between the agents at each time step. A ground sensing coverage use case was chosen to illustrate the current capabilities of this tool.

Abstract: Industrial robots are increasingly deployed in contact-rich construction and manufacturing tasks that involve uncertainty and long-horizon execution. While learning-based visuomotor policies offer a promising alternative to open-loop control, their deployment on industrial platforms is challenged by a large observation-execution gap caused by sensing, inference, and control latency. This gap is significantly greater than on low-latency research robots due to high-level interfaces and slower closed-loop dynamics, making execution timing a critical system-level issue. This paper presents a latency-aware framework for deploying and evaluating visuomotor policies on industrial robotic arms under realistic timing constraints. The framework integrates calibrated multimodal sensing, temporally consistent synchronization, a unified communication pipeline, and a teleoperation interface for demonstration collection. Within this framework, we introduce a latency-aware execution strategy that schedules finite-horizon, policy-predicted action sequences based on temporal feasibility, enabling asynchronous inference and execution without modifying policy architectures or training. We evaluate the framework on a contact-rich industrial assembly task while systematically varying inference latency. Using identical policies and sensing pipelines, we compare latency-aware execution with blocking and naive asynchronous baselines. Results show that latency-aware execution maintains smooth motion, compliant contact behavior, and consistent task progression across a wide range of latencies while reducing idle time and avoiding instability observed in baseline methods. These findings highlight the importance of explicitly handling latency for reliable closed-loop deployment of visuomotor policies on industrial robots.

Abstract: We propose a novel autonomous robotic palpation framework for real-time elastic mapping during tissue exploration using a viscoelastic tissue model. The method combines force-based parameter estimation using a commercial force/torque sensor with an ergodic control strategy driven by a tailored Expected Information Density, which explicitly biases exploration toward diagnostically relevant regions by jointly considering model uncertainty, stiffness magnitude, and spatial gradients. An Extended Kalman Filter is employed to estimate viscoelastic model parameters online, while Gaussian Process Regression provides spatial modelling of the estimated elasticity, and a Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage controller enables adaptive, continuous trajectory planning. Simulations on synthetic stiffness maps demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better reconstruction accuracy, enhanced segmentation capability, and improved robustness in detecting stiff inclusions compared to Bayesian Optimisation-based techniques. Experimental validation on a silicone phantom with embedded inclusions emulating pathological tissue regions further corroborates the potential of the method for autonomous tissue characterisation in diagnostic and screening applications.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a vision-aided navigation (VAN) pipeline designed to support ground navigation of autonomous aircraft. The proposed algorithm combines the computational efficiency of indirect methods with the robustness of direct image-based techniques to enhance solution integrity. The pipeline starts by processing ground images (e.g., acquired by a taxiing aircraft) and relates them via a feature-based structure-from-motion (SfM) solution. A ground plane mosaic is then constructed via homography transforms and matched to satellite imagery using a sum of squares differences (SSD) of intensities. Experimental results reveal that drift within the SfM solution, similar to that observed in dead-reckoning systems, challenges the expected accuracy benefits of map-matching with a wide-baseline ground-plane mosaic. However, the proposed algorithm demonstrates key integrity features, such as the ability to identify registration anomalies and ambiguous matches. These characteristics of the pipeline can mitigate outlier behaviors and contribute toward a robust, certifiable solution for autonomous surface movement of aircraft.

Abstract: This paper presents Adaptive Whole-body Loco-Manipulation, AdaptManip, a fully autonomous framework for humanoid robots to perform integrated navigation, object lifting, and delivery. Unlike prior imitation learning-based approaches that rely on human demonstrations and are often brittle to disturbances, AdaptManip aims to train a robust loco-manipulation policy via reinforcement learning without human demonstrations or teleoperation data. The proposed framework consists of three coupled components: (1) a recurrent object state estimator that tracks the manipulated object in real time under limited field-of-view and occlusions; (2) a whole-body base policy for robust locomotion with residual manipulation control for stable object lifting and delivery; and (3) a LiDAR-based robot global position estimator that provides drift-robust localization. All components are trained in simulation using reinforcement learning and deployed on real hardware in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results show that AdaptManip significantly outperforms baseline methods, including imitation learning-based approaches, in adaptability and overall success rate, while accurate object state estimation improves manipulation performance even under occlusion. We further demonstrate fully autonomous real-world navigation, object lifting, and delivery on a humanoid robot.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation tasks in unstructured environments pose significant robustness challenges for robot learning, where unexpected collisions can cause damage and hinder policy acquisition. Existing soft end-effectors face fundamental limitations: they either provide a limited deformation range, lack directional stiffness control, or require complex actuation systems that compromise practicality. This study introduces CLAW (Compliant Leaf-spring Anisotropic soft Wrist), a novel soft wrist mechanism that addresses these limitations through a simple yet effective design using two orthogonal leaf springs and rotary joints with a locking mechanism. CLAW provides large 6-degree-of-freedom deformation (40mm lateral, 20mm vertical), anisotropic stiffness that is tunable across three distinct modes, while maintaining lightweight construction (330g) at low cost ($550). Experimental evaluations using imitation learning demonstrate that CLAW achieves 76% success rate in benchmark peg-insertion tasks, outperforming both the Fin Ray gripper (43%) and rigid gripper alternatives (36%). CLAW successfully handles diverse contact-rich scenarios, including precision assembly with tight tolerances and delicate object manipulation, demonstrating its potential to enable robust robot learning in contact-rich domains.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are employed in various scenarios in building construction. However, autonomous stair climbing across different indoor staircases remains a major challenge for robot dogs to complete building construction tasks. In this project, we employed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize a robot's performance on U-shaped stairs. The training robot-dog modality, Unitree Go2, was first trained to climb stairs on Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain, and then to climb a U-shaped indoor staircase using the learned policies. This project explores end-to-end RL methods that enable robot dogs to autonomously climb stairs. The results showed (1) the successful goal reached for robot dogs climbing U-shaped stairs with a stall penalty, and (2) the transferability from the policy trained on U-shaped stairs to deployment on straight, L-shaped, and spiral stair terrains, and transferability from other stair models to deployment on U-shaped terrain.

Abstract: Robotic knot-tying represents a fundamental challenge in robotics due to the complex interactions between deformable objects and strict topological constraints. We present TWISTED-RL, a framework that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art in demonstration-free knot-tying (TWISTED), which smartly decomposed a single knot-tying problem into manageable subproblems, each addressed by a specialized agent. Our approach replaces TWISTED's single-step inverse model that was learned via supervised learning with a multi-step Reinforcement Learning policy conditioned on abstract topological actions rather than goal states. This change allows more delicate topological state transitions while avoiding costly and ineffective data collection protocols, thus enabling better generalization across diverse knot configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that TWISTED-RL manages to solve previously unattainable knots of higher complexity, including commonly used knots such as the Figure-8 and the Overhand. Furthermore, the increase in success rates and drop in planning time establishes TWISTED-RL as the new state-of-the-art in robotic knot-tying without human demonstrations.

Conclusion: 耦合信念推理、主动探测与风险监控可构建原理清晰、可解释性强的不确定性规划框架，提升交互安全性与效率。

Abstract: Autonomous driving in complex traffic requires reasoning under uncertainty. Common approaches rely on prediction-based planning or risk-aware control, but these are typically treated in isolation, limiting their ability to capture the coupled nature of action and inference in interactive settings. This gap becomes especially critical in uncertain scenarios, where simply reacting to predictions can lead to unsafe maneuvers or overly conservative behavior. Our central insight is that safe interaction requires not only estimating human behavior but also shaping it when ambiguity poses risks. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical belief model that structures human behavior across coarse discrete intents and fine motion modes, updated via Bayesian inference for interpretable multi-resolution reasoning. On top of this, we develop an active probing strategy that identifies when multimodal ambiguity in human predictions may compromise safety and plans disambiguating actions that both reveal intent and gently steer human decisions toward safer outcomes. Finally, a runtime risk-evaluation layer based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ensures that all probing actions remain within human risk tolerance during influence. Our simulations in lane-merging and unsignaled intersection scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates and shorter completion times compared to existing methods. These results highlight the benefit of coupling belief inference, probing, and risk monitoring, yielding a principled and interpretable framework for planning under uncertainty.

Conclusion: 双重校正机制有效弥补了VLM在HRC中推理不可靠与执行不可控的缺陷，提升了系统在真实动态协作环境中的实用性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility.

Abstract: This paper presents a simulation-driven approach for automating the force-controlled assembly of electrical terminals on DIN-rails, a task traditionally hindered by high programming effort and product variability. The proposed method integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with parameterizable robot skills in a physics-based simulation environment. To realistically model the snap-fit assembly process, we develop and evaluate two types of joining models: analytical models based on beam theory and rigid-body models implemented in the MuJoCo physics engine. These models enable accurate simulation of interaction forces, essential for training DRL agents. The robot skills are structured using the pitasc framework, allowing modular, reusable control strategies. Training is conducted in simulation using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms. Domain randomization is applied to improve robustness. The trained policies are transferred to a physical UR10e robot system without additional tuning. Experimental results demonstrate high success rates (up to 100%) in both simulation and real-world settings, even under significant positional and rotational deviations. The system generalizes well to new terminal types and positions, significantly reducing manual programming effort. This work highlights the potential of combining simulation-based learning with modular robot skills for flexible, scalable automation in small-batch manufacturing. Future work will explore hybrid learning methods, automated environment parameterization, and further refinement of joining models for design integration.

Abstract: Endoluminal surgery offers a minimally invasive option for early-stage gastrointestinal and urinary tract cancers but is limited by surgical tools and a steep learning curve. Robotic systems, particularly continuum robots, provide flexible instruments that enable precise tissue resection, potentially improving outcomes. This paper presents a visual perception platform for a continuum robotic system in endoluminal surgery. Our goal is to utilize monocular endoscopic image-based perception algorithms to identify position and orientation of flexible instruments and measure their distances from tissues. We introduce 2D and 3D learning-based perception algorithms and develop a physically-realistic simulator that models flexible instruments dynamics. This simulator generates realistic endoluminal scenes, enabling control of flexible robots and substantial data collection. Using a continuum robot prototype, we conducted module and system-level evaluations. Results show that our algorithms improve control of flexible instruments, reducing manipulation time by over 70% for trajectory-following tasks and enhancing understanding of surgical scenarios, leading to robust endoluminal surgeries.

Conclusion: ManeuverNet是一种高效、鲁棒且实用的双阿克曼机器人自主控制方案，为农业等受限空间下的复杂机动任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: Autonomous control of double-Ackermann-steering robots is essential in agricultural applications, where robots must execute precise and complex maneuvers within a limited space. Classical methods, such as the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner, can address this problem, but they rely on parameter tuning, making them highly sensitive to changes in robot configuration or environment and impractical to deploy without constant recalibration. At the same time, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, resulting in sub-optimal policies and poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper presents ManeuverNet, a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems, combining Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. Furthermore, ManeuverNet introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning. Unlike prior work, ManeuverNet does not depend on expert data or handcrafted guidance. We extensively evaluate ManeuverNet against both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and the TEB planner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines. Moreover, ManeuverNet effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity observed in the TEB planner. In real-world trials, ManeuverNet achieved up to a 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, where classical centralized approaches exhibit exponential growth in joint-state complexity as the number of agents increases. This paper investigates Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) as a structurally scalable alternative for simultaneous multi-robot path planning. This approach is a robotics-oriented QUBO formulation incorporating BFS-based logical pre-processing (achieving over 95% variable reduction), adaptive penalty design for collision and constraint enforcement, and a time-windowed decomposition strategy that enables execution within current hardware limitations. An experimental evaluation in grid environments with up to four robots demonstrated near-optimal solutions in dense scenarios and favorable scaling behavior compared to sequential classical planning. These results establish a practical and reproducible baseline for future quantum and quantum-inspired multi-robot coordinations.

Conclusion: SemFM实现了轻量、可解释的跨物体功能迁移，适用于实际机器人感知-动作流程。

Abstract: Traditional learning from demonstration (LfD) generally demands a cumbersome collection of physical demonstrations, which can be time-consuming and challenging to scale. Recent advances show that robots can instead learn from human videos by extracting interaction cues without direct robot involvement. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to generalize demonstrated interactions across different object instances that share similar functionality but vary significantly in geometry. In this work, we propose \emph{Semantic Anchored Functional Maps} (SemFM), a framework for transferring affordances across objects from a single visual demonstration. Starting from a coarse mesh reconstructed from an image, our method identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, and propagates these constraints over the surface using a functional map to obtain a dense, semantically consistent correspondence. This enables demonstrated interaction regions to be transferred across geometrically diverse objects in a lightweight and interpretable manner. Experiments on synthetic object categories and real-world robotic manipulation tasks show that our approach enables accurate affordance transfer with modest computational cost, making it well-suited for practical robotic perception-to-action pipelines.

Abstract: Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM) operations require strategic flight planning services that predict both spatial and temporal uncertainties to safely validate flight plans against hazards such as weather cells, restricted airspaces, and CNS disruption areas. Current uncertainty estimation methods for AAM vehicles rely on conservative linear models due to limited real-world performance data. This paper presents a novel Kalman Filter-based uncertainty propagation method that models AAM Flight Management System (FMS) architectures through sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance. Unlike existing approaches with fixed uncertainty thresholds, our method continuously adapts the filter's measurement trust based on progress toward waypoints, enabling FMS correction behavior to emerge naturally. The approach scales proportionally with control inputs and is tunable to match specific aircraft characteristics or route conditions. We validate the method using real ADS-B data from general aviation aircraft divided into training and verification sets. Uncertainty propagation parameters were tuned on the training set, achieving 76% accuracy in predicting arrival times when compared against the verification dataset, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for strategic flight plan validation in AAM operations.

Abstract: Kinematics of mechanisms is intricately coupled to their geometry and their utility often arises out of the ability to perform reproducible motion with fewer actuating degrees of freedom. In this article, we explore the assembly of scissor-units, each made of two rigid linear members connected by a pin joint. The assembly has a single degree of freedom, where actuating any single unit results in a shape change of the entire assembly. We derive expressions for the effective curvature of the unit and the trajectory of the mechanism's tip as a function of the geometric variables which we then use as the basis to program two tasks in the mechanism: shape morphing and writing. By phrasing these tasks as optimization problems and utilizing the differentiable simulation framework, we arrive at solutions that are then tested in table-top experiments. Our results show that the geometry of scissor assemblies can be leveraged for automated navigation and inspection in complex domains, in light of the optimization framework. However, we highlight that the challenges associated with rapid programming and error-free implementation in experiments without feedback still remain.

Abstract: Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.

Motivation: 突破传统互联网预训练模型适配物理任务的范式，将物理具身性从微调附加项提升为建模起点。

Method: 提出三阶段训练流程：1）基于多源异构数据（网络文本、自动驾驶场景、具身交互日志）对视觉-语言模型（VLM）进行大规模统一预训练；2）在VLM上构建流匹配动作专家，并采用混合梯度更新策略（具身数据不反传至VLM，非具身数据仍可训练VLM）；3）引入具身空间支架策略以构建空间链式推理（Spatial CoT），约束动作解空间。

Result: 在RoboChallenge基准的Table30任务上，DM0在专家型（Specialist）和通用型（Generalist）设置下均达到当前最优性能（SOTA）。

Conclusion: 具身原生建模路径优于后适配范式；统一多源预训练、分层梯度控制与空间结构化推理是提升物理AI泛化与控制能力的关键设计。

Abstract: Moving beyond the traditional paradigm of adapting internet-pretrained models to physical tasks, we present DM0, an Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for Physical AI. Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RynnBrain，一个面向具身智能的开源时空基础模型，旨在统一整合感知、推理与规划能力，并在多个基准测试中显著超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身智能领域缺乏一个统一的、基于物理的基础模型来整合感知、推理和规划能力，以应对真实世界中的时空动态。

Method: 提出RynnBrain模型，包含三种不同规模的基础模型（2B、8B、30B-A3B MoE）及四种针对下游任务微调的变体（如导航、规划、视觉语言动作等），强调以自我为中心的理解、时空定位、物理驱动推理与物理感知规划。

Result: 在20个具身智能基准和8个通用视觉理解基准上大幅超越现有具身基础模型；微调模型验证了其在物理推理/规划及作为强预训练主干适配多样任务方面的潜力。

Conclusion: RynnBrain为具身智能提供了统一、物理 grounded 的时空基础模型框架，具备良好的可扩展性与任务适应性，推动了该领域的基础模型发展。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in multimodal foundation models, embodied intelligence community still lacks a unified, physically grounded foundation model that integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within real-world spatial-temporal dynamics. We introduce RynnBrain, an open-source spatiotemporal foundation model for embodied intelligence. RynnBrain strengthens four core capabilities in a unified framework: comprehensive egocentric understanding, diverse spatiotemporal localization, physically grounded reasoning, and physics-aware planning. The RynnBrain family comprises three foundation model scales (2B, 8B, and 30B-A3B MoE) and four post-trained variants tailored for downstream embodied tasks (i.e., RynnBrain-Nav, RynnBrain-Plan, and RynnBrain-VLA) or complex spatial reasoning tasks (i.e., RynnBrain-CoP). In terms of extensive evaluations on 20 embodied benchmarks and 8 general vision understanding benchmarks, our RynnBrain foundation models largely outperform existing embodied foundation models by a significant margin. The post-trained model suite further substantiates two key potentials of the RynnBrain foundation model: (i) enabling physically grounded reasoning and planning, and (ii) serving as a strong pretrained backbone that can be efficiently adapted to diverse embodied tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出Big Picture Policies (BPP)，通过视觉语言模型选取关键帧来替代完整历史观测，缓解因历史空间覆盖不足导致的策略对虚假相关性的依赖，显著提升需历史记忆的机器人任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最优机器人策略通常只基于当前观测，难以处理需记忆历史的任务（如搜索物品）；而直接使用历史观测又易因训练数据覆盖不足导致策略学习到虚假相关性，泛化性差。

Method: 提出Big Picture Policies（BPP），利用视觉语言模型自动检测并仅保留任务相关的少量关键帧（keyframes）作为历史摘要，从而在保持表达能力的同时大幅压缩历史表征空间、缓解分布偏移。

Result: 在4个真实世界操作任务和3个仿真任务（均需历史条件）上评估，BPP在真实世界评测中成功率比最优基线高70%。

Conclusion: 以语义关键帧替代原始历史观测是一种更鲁棒、更可扩展的历史建模方式，能有效解决长时程任务中因历史空间爆炸导致的泛化瓶颈。

Abstract: Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations.

*Sha Li,Stefano Petrangeli,Yu Shen,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LaySPA是一种强化学习框架，通过在结构化文本空间环境中进行策略学习，赋予大语言模型显式、可解释的空间推理能力，用于内容感知的图形布局设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型空间推理能力有限以及设计决策过程缺乏透明性的问题。

Method: 将布局设计重构为在编码画布几何、元素属性和元素间关系的结构化文本空间环境中的策略学习问题；采用多目标空间评价（几何有效性、关系一致性、美学一致性）和相对组优化训练布局策略；输出可解释的推理轨迹和结构化布局规范。

Result: 实验表明LaySPA提升了布局的结构有效性和视觉质量，性能优于更大的专有大语言模型，并与最先进的专用布局生成器相当，同时所需标注样本更少、延迟更低。

Conclusion: LaySPA实现了对图形布局设计过程的透明化、可控化，兼顾了通用大模型的灵活性与专业布局工具的性能。

Abstract: We introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning framework that equips large language models (LLMs) with explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for content-aware graphic layout design. LaySPA addresses two key challenges: LLMs' limited spatial reasoning and the lack of opacity in design decision making. Instead of operating at the pixel level, we reformulate layout design as a policy learning problem over a structured textual spatial environment that explicitly encodes canvas geometry, element attributes, and inter-element relationships. LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces. Experiments demonstrate that LaySPA improves structural validity and visual quality, outperforming larger proprietary LLMs and achieving performance comparable to specialized SOTA layout generators while requiring fewer annotated samples and reduced latency.

### [336] [Agentic AI for Commercial Insurance Underwriting with Adversarial Self-Critique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13213)
*Joyjit Roy,Samaresh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向受监管保险承保场景的'决策否定型、人在回路中'智能体系统，引入对抗式自我批评机制作为安全架构，并构建了决策否定型智能体的失效模式分类法；实验表明该机制显著降低幻觉率（11.3%→3.8%）并提升决策准确率（92%→96%），同时严格保障人类对最终决策的控制权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI方案在受监管、高风险的保险承保中缺乏充分推理能力与可靠性保障机制，且完全自动化既不现实也不可取，亟需兼顾安全性、可解释性与人类问责的新型AI协作范式。

Method: 设计一种决策否定型（decision-negative）、人在回路中的多智能体系统，其中主智能体生成承保建议，批判智能体对其进行对抗式自我质疑；同时构建面向该类系统的失效模式形式化分类法，并在500例专家标注的真实承保案例上开展实证评估。

Result: 对抗式自我批评机制将AI幻觉率从11.3%降至3.8%，决策准确率从92%提升至96%；系统天然确保所有具约束力的决策均由人类作出，验证了其在高风险监管场景下的有效性与安全性。

Conclusion: 对抗式自我批评是一种可行且有效的受限安全架构，能显著提升AI在受监管领域的可靠性与可信赖性，为‘人类不可替代’的关键决策场景提供了负责任AI集成的新范式。

Abstract: Commercial insurance underwriting is a labor-intensive process that requires manual review of extensive documentation to assess risk and determine policy pricing. While AI offers substantial efficiency improvements, existing solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and internal mechanisms to ensure reliability within regulated, high-stakes environments. Full automation remains impractical and inadvisable in scenarios where human judgment and accountability are critical. This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design. These findings indicate that adversarial self-critique supports safer AI deployment in regulated domains and offers a model for responsible integration where human oversight is indispensable.

*Lingfeng Li,Yunlong Lu,Yuefei Zhang,Jingyu Yao,Yixin Zhu,KeYuan Cheng,Yongyi Wang,Qirui Zheng,Xionghui Yang,Wenxin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于固定技能层级AI的锚定评估框架BotzoneBench，用于对大语言模型（LLM）的战略推理能力进行线性、可解释、跨时间稳定的绝对评估，覆盖八类游戏，并验证了其在衡量交互式AI能力上的有效性与可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评测方法难以系统评估其在动态交互环境中的战略决策能力：静态任务评测缺乏动态性，而LLM-vs-LLM锦标赛依赖易变的模型池、计算成本高、缺乏稳定基准。

Method: 构建以Botzone平台为基础的BotzoneBench评测基准，锚定于技能校准的固定AI对手（而非其他LLM），在八种涵盖确定性/随机性、完全/不完全信息的游戏中，对5个主流LLM共177,047个状态-动作对进行系统评估。

Result: 发现不同LLM间存在显著战略能力差异，顶尖模型在多个游戏中达到中高级专用游戏AI水平；该锚定范式支持线性时间评估、跨版本纵向追踪及结果稳定可解释。

Conclusion: 锚定于技能校准AI的评估范式能有效实现LLM战略能力的绝对、可扩展、可复用评测，且可推广至任何具备明确定义技能层级的交互式AI领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive environments requiring strategic decision-making, yet systematic evaluation of these capabilities remains challenging. Existing benchmarks for LLMs primarily assess static reasoning through isolated tasks and fail to capture dynamic strategic abilities. Recent game-based evaluations employ LLM-vs-LLM tournaments that produce relative rankings dependent on transient model pools, incurring quadratic computational costs and lacking stable performance anchors for longitudinal tracking. The central challenge is establishing a scalable evaluation framework that measures LLM strategic reasoning against consistent, interpretable standards rather than volatile peer models. Here we show that anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables linear-time absolute skill measurement with stable cross-temporal interpretability. Built on the Botzone platform's established competitive infrastructure, our BotzoneBench evaluates LLMs across eight diverse games spanning deterministic perfect-information board games to stochastic imperfect-information card games. Through systematic assessment of 177,047 state-action pairs from five flagship models, we reveal significant performance disparities and identify distinct strategic behaviors, with top-performing models achieving proficiency comparable to mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains. This anchored evaluation paradigm generalizes beyond games to any domain with well-defined skill hierarchies, establishing a scalable and reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities.

### [338] [When to Think Fast and Slow? AMOR: Entropy-Based Metacognitive Gate for Dynamic SSM-Attention Switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13215)
*Haoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出AMOR（自适应元认知输出路由器），一种结合状态空间模型（SSM）与稀疏注意力的混合架构，通过预测熵动态触发注意力机制，在保证长程信息检索精度的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer对所有位置均匀分配计算资源，缺乏自适应性；SSM虽高效但长程检索精度不足；受认知双过程理论启发，需在效率与精度间取得平衡。

Method: 提出AMOR架构：以SSM为骨干，用其隐藏状态生成‘Ghost KV’用于稀疏注意力；仅当SSM预测熵高于阈值（即‘不确定’时）才激活注意力；路由决策基于信息熵，具可解释性。

Result: 在小规模合成检索任务上，AMOR实现100%检索准确率，仅在22%的位置启用注意力；预测熵在检索位与局部位间存在1.09 nats显著差异，验证其作为路由信号的可靠性。

Conclusion: AMOR成功融合SSM的线性效率与注意力的精准检索能力，提供了一种可解释、自适应、高效的新范式，为下一代高效序列建模提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Transformers allocate uniform computation to every position, regardless of difficulty. State Space Models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives but struggle with precise information retrieval over a long horizon. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition (Kahneman, 2011), we propose AMOR (Adaptive Metacognitive Output Router), a hybrid architecture that dynamically engages sparse attention only when an SSM backbone is "uncertain"--as measured by prediction entropy. Compared to standard transformers, AMOR gains efficiency by projecting keys and values from SSM hidden states (Ghost KV), reusing the SSM's O(n) computation rather than requiring O(n^2) attention at every layer. On small-scale synthetic retrieval tasks, AMOR outperforms both SSM-only and transformer-only baselines, achieving perfect retrieval accuracy while engaging attention on only 22% of positions. We validate that prediction entropy reliably signals retrieval need, with a gap of 1.09 nats (nearly half the entropy range) between retrieval and local positions. Additionally, our approach provides interpretable adaptive computation, where routing decisions can be understood in information-theoretic terms.

*Zerui Cheng,Jiashuo Liu,Chunjie Wu,Jianzhu Yao,Pramod Viswanath,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出VeRA框架，通过将基准问题转化为可执行规范，自动生成无限量经验证的变体问题，以解决当前评估方法静态、易被记忆和格式利用的问题。VeRA包含自然语言模板、配置生成器与确定性验证器，并支持等价重写（VeRA-E）与难度增强（VeRA-H）两种模式，显著提升评估鲁棒性与可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方案多为静态，重复使用相同题目导致模型记忆、格式滥用与性能饱和，难以真实衡量AI进步；亟需从构造层面即具备鲁棒性的评估方法。

Method: 提出VeRA（Verified Reasoning Data Augmentation）框架：将种子问题转化为含占位符的自然语言模板；由连贯生成器采样合法配置；再经确定性验证器验证参数并计算正确答案；支持VeRA-E（保持逻辑等价）与VeRA-H（可控增难）双模式。

Result: 在16个前沿模型上验证表明：(i) VeRA-E提升评估质量并揭示数据污染；(ii) VeRA-H实现无人工干预的高难度任务生成与精准标注；(iii) VeRA确立‘可验证基准’为通用范式，使评估从静态转向按需生成。

Conclusion: VeRA将基准重新定义为可执行规范，支持无限、低成本、标签可靠的动态评估，在可验证领域具有普适性与可扩展性；代码与数据集已全部开源。

Abstract: The main issue with most evaluation schemes today is their "static" nature: the same problems are reused repeatedly, allowing for memorization, format exploitation, and eventual saturation. To measure genuine AI progress, we need evaluation that is robust by construction, not by post-hoc detection. In response, we propose VeRA (Verified Reasoning Data Augmentation), a framework that converts benchmark problems into executable specifications, comprising (i) a natural language template with placeholder slots, (ii) a coherent generator that samples valid configurations, and (iii) a deterministic verifier that validates parameters and calculates the corresponding correct answers for each configuration. From a single seed problem, VeRA automatically creates unlimited verified variants with reliable labels at near-zero marginal cost without human involvement.
  VeRA operates in two complementary modes. VeRA-E (equivalent) rewrites problems while keeping the underlying logic intact, useful for detecting memorization versus genuine reasoning. VeRA-H (hardened) systematically increases complexity while remaining verifiable, enabling reliable creation and labelling of fresh difficult tasks at the boundary of intelligence. Evaluating 16 frontier models with VeRA, we find: (i) VeRA-E improves evaluation quality and reveals contamination patterns. (ii) VeRA-H enables human-free generation of hard tasks with reliable labels. (iii) VeRA establishes verified benchmarks as a general paradigm. VeRA reconceptualizes benchmarks from static objects used until exhausted, to executable specifications generating fresh, verified instances on demand, enhancing robustness and cost-effectiveness for evaluation.
  With VeRA, we envision that evaluation in any verifiable domain can scale indefinitely without sacrificing label integrity. To stimulate future research, we have open-sourced all code and datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出SSLogic框架，通过生成-验证-修复循环合成可执行的生成器-验证器程序对，实现逻辑推理任务族的规模化演进，并引入多门控验证协议确保任务可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展可验证训练信号是强化学习中的一大瓶颈，而现有逻辑推理任务合成方法受限于专家编写代码或固定模板，难以实现任务族级别的扩展。

Method: 提出SSLogic：一种基于智能体的元合成框架，采用生成-验证-修复闭环迭代合成Generator-Validator程序对；引入Multi-Gate Validation Protocol，结合多策略一致性检查与对抗性盲审机制以过滤模糊或不良任务。

Result: 从400个种子任务族出发，经两轮演化扩展至953个任务族、21,389个可验证实例；在多个基准（SynLogic、BBEH、AIME25、Brumo25）上显著提升性能。

Conclusion: SSLogic实现了逻辑推理任务族的可控、可靠、规模化演进，为RLVR提供了高质量、可扩展的训练信号源。

Abstract: Scaling verifiable training signals remains a key bottleneck for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Logical reasoning is a natural substrate: constraints are formal and answers are programmatically checkable. However, prior synthesis pipelines either depend on expert-written code or operate within fixed templates/skeletons, which limits growth largely to instance-level perturbations. We propose SSLogic, an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales at the task-family level by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed Generate--Validate--Repair loop, enabling continuous family evolution with controllable difficulty. To ensure reliability, we introduce a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol that combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks. Starting from 400 seed families, two evolution rounds expand to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances (from 5,718). Training on SSLogic-evolved data yields consistent gains over the seed baseline at matched training steps, improving SynLogic by +5.2, BBEH by +1.4, AIME25 by +3.0, and Brumo25 by +3.7.

### [341] [A Geometric Taxonomy of Hallucinations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13224)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于嵌入空间几何特征的幻觉（hallucination）分类法，区分了三种类型：不忠实（unfaithfulness）、虚构（confabulation）和事实错误（factual error）；发现前两类在嵌入空间中具有可检测的几何方向（尤其人类构造的虚构内容可被单一同向高精度识别），而第三类因嵌入本质依赖共现统计、无法反映真实世界对应关系，故不可检测，需外部验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有'幻觉'概念混同了不同本质的现象，导致检测方法泛化性差；需从嵌入空间几何结构出发，厘清哪些幻觉类型可被embedding-based方法识别，哪些本质上不可行。

Method: 提出三类幻觉的几何定义；在多领域标准基准与人工构造的confabulation数据上，测量检测器的跨域AUROC及判别方向间余弦相似度；分析嵌入表示对事实性建模的理论局限。

Result: Type I & II 幻觉在域内检测AUROC达0.76–0.99，人工confabulation可用单一全局方向达0.96 AUROC（仅3.8%跨域下降）；Type III 仅为0.478 AUROC（近随机）；判别方向跨域近似正交（均值cosine=-0.07）。

Conclusion: embedding空间能有效捕捉生成伪迹（Type I/II）的几何信号，但无法编码真实性（Type III），因此基于嵌入的检测仅适用于前两类；Type III必须依赖外部知识验证。

Abstract: The term "hallucination" in large language models conflates distinct phenomena with different geometric signatures in embedding space. We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality. Statements with identical contextual patterns occupy similar embedding regions regardless of truth value. The contribution is a geometric taxonomy clarifying the scope of embedding-based detection: Types I and II are detectable; Type III requires external verification mechanisms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单而有效的LLM生成文本检测方法VaryBalance，利用人类文本与其经LLM重写版本之间差异更大的特性，通过均值标准差进行量化区分，在AUROC上较现有最优方法Binoculars提升达34.3%，且具备跨模型和多语言鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本检测器依赖不切实际的假设（如白盒设置）或仅使用文本级特征，导致检测精度不足。

Method: 提出VaryBalance方法，核心是观察到人类文本与其经LLM重写后的版本之间差异大于LLM生成文本与其重写版本之间的差异，并利用均值标准差量化该差异以实现检测。

Result: 在多项实验中，VaryBalance在AUROC指标上比当前最优检测器Binoculars最高提升34.3%，并展现出对多种生成模型和多语言的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VaryBalance是一种简单、有效且实用的LLM生成文本检测方法，显著提升了检测性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial but challenging. Existing detectors depend on impractical assumptions, such as white-box settings, or solely rely on text-level features, leading to imprecise detection ability. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective and practical LLM-generated text detection method, VaryBalance. The core of VaryBalance is that, compared to LLM-generated texts, there is a greater difference between human texts and their rewritten version via LLMs. Leveraging this observation, VaryBalance quantifies this through mean standard deviation and distinguishes human texts and LLM-generated texts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that VaryBalance outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors, i.e., Binoculars, by up to 34.3\% in terms of AUROC, and maintains robustness against multiple generating models and languages.

*Truong Xuan Khanh,Truong Quynh Hoa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出轨迹主导帕累托优化（TDPO）框架，指出智能系统长期适应性停滞源于轨迹层面的帕累托陷阱，而非学习、数据或模型容量不足；定义了逃逸难度指数（TEDI）量化陷阱刚性，并证明智能上限是轨迹支配关系的几何必然结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在长时程适应性上出现停滞，作者认为该问题根源不在于学习能力、数据量或模型规模，而在于智能优化过程本身的结构特性——即智能作为轨迹级现象所面临的多目标权衡。

Method: 构建轨迹主导帕累托优化（TDPO）框架，将帕累托最优从点扩展到完整行为轨迹；定义帕累托陷阱与逃逸难度指数（TEDI），并建立帕累托陷阱形式化分类体系；通过极小智能体-环境模型进行轨迹发散分析。

Result: 揭示帕累托陷阱是导致局部非支配却阻碍全局更优路径的轨迹空间区域；证明动态智能上限是轨迹级支配关系的固有几何后果；提出TEDI可量化陷阱刚性；建立帕累托陷阱分类法并验证轨迹级分化现象。

Conclusion: 智能的本质应从终端性能转向优化几何结构；TDPO框架为诊断和突破自适应系统的长时程发展约束提供了原理性工具。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in artificial intelligence, many systems exhibit stagnation in long-horizon adaptability despite continued performance optimization. This work argues that such limitations do not primarily arise from insufficient learning, data, or model capacity, but from a deeper structural property of how intelligence is optimized over time. We formulate intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon governed by multi-objective trade-offs, and introduce Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, a path-wise generalization of classical Pareto optimality in which dominance is defined over full trajectories. Within this framework, Pareto traps emerge as locally non-dominated regions of trajectory space that nevertheless restrict access to globally superior developmental paths under conservative local optimization. To characterize the rigidity of such constraints, we define the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI), a composite geometric measure capturing escape distance, structural constraints, and behavioral inertia. We show that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise as inevitable geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance, independent of learning progress or architectural scale. We further introduce a formal taxonomy of Pareto traps and illustrate the resulting trajectory-level divergence using a minimal agent-environment model. Together, these results shift the locus of intelligence from terminal performance to optimization geometry, providing a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming long-horizon developmental constraints in adaptive systems.

### [344] [PlotChain: Deterministic Checkpointed Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Engineering Plot Reading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13232)
*Mayank Ravishankara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlotChain 是一个基于生成器的确定性基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在工程图表定量解读任务上的能力，包含15类共450张可复现、带精确真值和中间检查点的图表，并支持细粒度诊断评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多聚焦OCR或自由文本描述，缺乏对工程图表中定量信息提取能力的系统、可复现、细粒度评估。

Method: 构建PlotChain生成器，批量渲染15类工程图表（如Bode图、FFT谱、应力-应变曲线等），每图由可控参数生成并附带精确真值及中间子任务字段（cp_）；采用零温度、JSON数值输出的确定性评估协议，按人眼读图精度设定各字段容差进行评分。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-4.1、Claude Sonnet 4.5在plotread容差下整体字段通过率分别为80.42%、79.84%、78.21%，GPT-4o为61.59%；频率域任务（如带通响应、FFT谱）表现显著更差（≤23%）。

Conclusion: PlotChain提供了首个面向工程图表定量解读的可复现、诊断型基准；当前MLLMs虽在多数图表上表现良好，但在频率域解析等关键工程能力上仍存在明显瓶颈。

Abstract: We present PlotChain, a deterministic, generator-based benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on engineering plot reading-recovering quantitative values from classic plots (e.g., Bode/FFT, step response, stress-strain, pump curves) rather than OCR-only extraction or free-form captioning. PlotChain contains 15 plot families with 450 rendered plots (30 per family), where every item is produced from known parameters and paired with exact ground truth computed directly from the generating process. A central contribution is checkpoint-based diagnostic evaluation: in addition to final targets, each item includes intermediate 'cp_' fields that isolate sub-skills (e.g., reading cutoff frequency or peak magnitude) and enable failure localization within a plot family. We evaluate four state-of-the-art MLLMs under a standardized, deterministic protocol (temperature = 0 and a strict JSON-only numeric output schema) and score predictions using per-field tolerances designed to reflect human plot-reading precision. Under the 'plotread' tolerance policy, the top models achieve 80.42% (Gemini 2.5 Pro), 79.84% (GPT-4.1), and 78.21% (Claude Sonnet 4.5) overall field-level pass rates, while GPT-4o trails at 61.59%. Despite strong performance on many families, frequency-domain tasks remain brittle: bandpass response stays low (<= 23%), and FFT spectrum remains challenging. We release the generator, dataset, raw model outputs, scoring code, and manifests with checksums to support fully reproducible runs and retrospective rescoring under alternative tolerance policies.

*Mingyang Liao,Yichen Wan,shuchen wu,Chenxi Miao,Xin Shen,Weikang Li,Yang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的双循环对抗自进化框架（Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution），通过攻击者循环生成更强越狱提示，防御者循环构建分层知识库（安全规则、角色约束、安全范例），在推理时检索并组合知识以兼顾角色保真度与安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的角色扮演系统在增强角色一致性的同时更易受越狱攻击，尤其针对高风险或负面角色；而训练时的防御方法成本高、难维护、易损害角色表现，且不适用于闭源前沿模型。

Method: 提出训练无关的双循环框架：Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle 自动生成渐进式强越狱提示；Role-Playing Defender Cycle 将失败案例提炼为三层知识库（全局安全规则、角色特化约束、安全角色范例），并在推理时动态检索组合该知识以引导生成。

Result: 在多个闭源大模型上实验表明，该方法在角色保真度和越狱抵抗能力上均显著优于强基线，并对未见角色和攻击提示具有鲁棒泛化性。

Conclusion: 该训练-free框架有效解耦安全性与角色一致性，为闭源及动态演化的角色扮演系统提供了高效、可扩展、可迁移的安全增强方案。

Abstract: LLM-based role-playing has rapidly improved in fidelity, yet stronger adherence to persona constraints commonly increases vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, especially for risky or negative personas. Most prior work mitigates this issue with training-time solutions (e.g., data curation or alignment-oriented regularization). However, these approaches are costly to maintain as personas and attack strategies evolve, can degrade in-character behavior, and are typically infeasible for frontier closed-weight LLMs. We propose a training-free Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution framework with two coupled cycles. A Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle synthesizes progressively stronger jailbreak prompts, while a Role-Playing Defender Cycle distills observed failures into a hierarchical knowledge base of (i) global safety rules, (ii) persona-grounded constraints, and (iii) safe in-character exemplars. At inference time, the Defender retrieves and composes structured knowledge from this hierarchy to guide generation, producing responses that remain faithful to the target persona while satisfying safety constraints. Extensive experiments across multiple proprietary LLMs show consistent gains over strong baselines on both role fidelity and jailbreak resistance, and robust generalization to unseen personas and attack prompts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Lang2Act，一种通过自涌现语言工具链实现细粒度视觉感知与推理的VRAG新方法，摆脱对固定外部工具的依赖，采用两阶段强化学习训练框架，在提升VLM视觉感知能力上取得超4%性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VRAG框架依赖预定义外部工具、将视觉感知与推理解耦，导致图像操作（如裁剪）中视觉信息损失。

Method: 提出Lang2Act，通过自涌现动作构建可复用的语言工具箱；设计两阶段RL训练框架：第一阶段优化VLM自主探索高质量动作，第二阶段优化其利用语言工具进行下游推理。

Result: 显著增强VLM视觉感知能力，在多个任务上性能提升超4%。

Conclusion: Lang2Act验证了无需固定外部工具、通过语言化自涌现动作即可有效提升VLM视觉感知与推理能力，为VRAG提供了更灵活、信息保留更完整的范式。

Abstract: Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by incorporating external visual documents to address a given query. Existing VRAG frameworks usually depend on rigid, pre-defined external tools to extend the perceptual capabilities of VLMs, typically by explicitly separating visual perception from subsequent reasoning processes. However, this decoupled design can lead to unnecessary loss of visual information, particularly when image-based operations such as cropping are applied. In this paper, we propose Lang2Act, which enables fine-grained visual perception and reasoning through self-emergent linguistic toolchains. Rather than invoking fixed external engines, Lang2Act collects self-emergent actions as linguistic tools and leverages them to enhance the visual perception capabilities of VLMs. To support this mechanism, we design a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework. Specifically, the first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for constructing a reusable linguistic toolbox, and the second stage further optimizes VLMs to exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Lang2Act in substantially enhancing the visual perception capabilities of VLMs, achieving performance improvements of over 4%.

*Rizky Ramadhana Putra,Raihan Sultan Pasha Basuki,Yutong Cheng,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出NL2LOGIC框架，通过引入抽象语法树（AST）作为中间表示，结合递归LLM语义解析器与AST引导的生成器，显著提升一阶逻辑翻译的语法准确率（99%）和语义正确性（提升最高30%），并在多个基准上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的逻辑翻译方法存在语法控制脆弱（全局语法规则约束弱）和语义保真度低（子句级语义理解不足）两大问题，难以满足法律、治理等领域对准确性与可解释性的高要求。

Method: 提出NL2LOGIC框架：以抽象语法树（AST）为中间表示；采用递归式大语言模型语义解析器进行结构化理解；设计AST引导的确定性生成器，输出可直接供求解器执行的逻辑代码。

Result: 在FOLIO、LogicNLI和ProofWriter基准上达到99%语法准确率，语义正确性最高提升30%；集成到Logic-LM后，逻辑代码可执行率达近100%，下游推理准确率提升31%。

Conclusion: NL2LOGIC通过AST中间表示与协同解析-生成机制，有效兼顾语法鲁棒性与语义保真度，为可信自动化逻辑推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Automated reasoning is critical in domains such as law and governance, where verifying claims against facts in documents requires both accuracy and interpretability. Recent work adopts structured reasoning pipelines that translate natural language into first-order logic and delegate inference to automated solvers. With the rise of large language models, approaches such as GCD and CODE4LOGIC leverage their reasoning and code generation capabilities to improve logic parsing. However, these methods suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness caused by insufficient clause-level semantic understanding. We propose NL2LOGIC, a first-order logic translation framework that introduces an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate representation. NL2LOGIC combines a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code. Experiments on the FOLIO, LogicNLI, and ProofWriter benchmarks show that NL2LOGIC achieves 99 percent syntactic accuracy and improves semantic correctness by up to 30 percent over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating NL2LOGIC into Logic-LM yields near-perfect executability and improves downstream reasoning accuracy by 31 percent compared to Logic-LM's original few-shot unconstrained translation module.

*Roham Koohestani,Ali Al-Kaswan,Jonathan Katzy,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在代码大语言模型中应用成员推断攻击（MIAs）进行数据使用审计的问题，比较了Loss Attack与Polarized Augment Calibration（PAC）方法，并提出了基于抽象语法树（AST）的改进方法AST-PAC，以提升对代码语法结构的适配性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码大语言模型常训练于含严格版权许可的源码数据集，引发数据治理与版权风险；需可靠审计手段（如成员推断攻击）检测未经授权的数据使用。

Method: 对3B–7B参数的代码模型开展探索性研究，对比Loss Attack与PAC方法；提出AST-PAC——一种基于抽象语法树（AST）扰动生成语法合法校准样本的领域自适应方法。

Result: PAC整体优于Loss基线，但其依赖破坏代码语法的增强策略，在大型复杂文件上性能下降；AST-PAC在语法规模增大时表现提升（PAC则退化），但在小文件上扰动不足、在字母数字密集代码上表现欠佳。

Conclusion: 语法感知与尺寸自适应的校准机制是实现代码大模型可信溯源审计的关键前提，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models are frequently trained on massive datasets containing restrictively licensed source code. This creates urgent data governance and copyright challenges. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) can serve as an auditing mechanism to detect unauthorized data usage in models. While attacks like the Loss Attack provide a baseline, more involved methods like Polarized Augment Calibration (PAC) remain underexplored in the code domain. This paper presents an exploratory study evaluating these methods on 3B--7B parameter code models. We find that while PAC generally outperforms the Loss baseline, its effectiveness relies on augmentation strategies that disregard the rigid syntax of code, leading to performance degradation on larger, complex files. To address this, we introduce AST-PAC, a domain-specific adaptation that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based perturbations to generate syntactically valid calibration samples. Preliminary results indicate that AST-PAC improves as syntactic size grows, where PAC degrades, but under-mutates small files and underperforms on alphanumeric-rich code. Overall, the findings motivate future work on syntax-aware and size-adaptive calibration as a prerequisite for reliable provenance auditing of code language models.

### [349] [DPBench: Large Language Models Struggle with Simultaneous Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13255)
*Najmul Hasan,Prashanth BusiReddyGari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出DPBench基准测试，基于哲学家就餐问题评估大语言模型在多智能体系统中的协调能力，发现LLM在顺序决策中表现良好，但在同时决策时极易陷入死锁（高达95%），且通信无法缓解该问题，表明需引入外部协调机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏能测试大语言模型在资源竞争下多智能体协调能力的基准；现有系统部署增多但协调可靠性未知。

Method: 构建DPBench基准，基于哲学家就餐问题，涵盖8种不同决策时机、群体规模和通信方式的条件；在GPT-5.2、Claude Opus 4.5和Grok 4.1上进行实验，并分析死锁成因。

Result: LLM在顺序决策中协调良好，但在同时决策下死锁率超95%；死锁源于‘收敛推理’——各智能体独立得出相同策略并同步执行；通信不仅无效，有时反而加剧死锁。

Conclusion: 依赖LLM自身涌现协调难以胜任并发资源访问场景，需设计外部协调机制；DPBench作为开源基准发布，支持后续研究。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, yet we lack benchmarks that test whether they can coordinate under resource contention. We introduce DPBench, a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination across eight conditions that vary decision timing, group size, and communication. Our experiments with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 reveal a striking asymmetry: LLMs coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail when decisions must be made simultaneously, with deadlock rates exceeding 95\% under some conditions. We trace this failure to convergent reasoning, where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that, when executed simultaneously, guarantee deadlock. Contrary to expectations, enabling communication does not resolve this problem and can even increase deadlock rates. Our findings suggest that multi-agent LLM systems requiring concurrent resource access may need external coordination mechanisms rather than relying on emergent coordination. DPBench is released as an open-source benchmark. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/najmulhasan-code/dpbench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出X-Blocks框架，从语境、句法和词汇三层系统分析自动驾驶车辆自然语言解释的构建方式，并通过RACE分类器等方法验证其有效性，为可解释AI提供语言学设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶解释方法缺乏系统性语言分析框架，难以支撑用户信任与接受。

Method: 提出X-Blocks分层框架（语境/句法/词汇三级），在语境层构建RACE多大模型集成分类器，在词汇层使用带Dirichlet先验的log-odds分析，在句法层采用依存解析与模板提取。

Result: RACE在BDD-X数据集上达91.45%准确率与0.91 Cohen's kappa；发现场景特异性词汇模式与有限可复用语法族；框架具备数据集无关性与任务独立性。

Conclusion: X-Blocks为生成场景感知、透明可信、认知易用的自动驾驶解释提供了基于实证的语言学设计原则。

Abstract: Natural language explanations play a critical role in establishing trust and acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs), yet existing approaches lack systematic frameworks for analysing how humans linguistically construct driving rationales across diverse scenarios. This paper introduces X-Blocks (eXplanation Blocks), a hierarchical analytical framework that identifies the linguistic building blocks of natural language explanations for AVs at three levels: context, syntax, and lexicon.
  At the context level, we propose RACE (Reasoning-Aligned Classification of Explanations), a multi-LLM ensemble framework that combines Chain-of-Thought reasoning with self-consistency mechanisms to robustly classify explanations into 32 scenario-aware categories. Applied to human-authored explanations from the Berkeley DeepDrive-X dataset, RACE achieves 91.45 percent accuracy and a Cohens kappa of 0.91 against cases with human annotator agreement, indicating near-human reliability for context classification.
  At the lexical level, log-odds analysis with informative Dirichlet priors reveals context-specific vocabulary patterns that distinguish driving scenarios. At the syntactic level, dependency parsing and template extraction show that explanations draw from a limited repertoire of reusable grammar families, with systematic variation in predicate types and causal constructions across contexts.
  The X-Blocks framework is dataset-agnostic and task-independent, offering broad applicability to other automated driving datasets and safety-critical domains. Overall, our findings provide evidence-based linguistic design principles for generating scenario-aware explanations that support transparency, user trust, and cognitive accessibility in automated driving systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出MAPLE框架，将记忆、学习与个性化分解为三个独立机制，显著提升LLM代理的个性化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在个体用户适应性上受限，根源在于将记忆、学习与个性化错误地视为统一能力，而忽视其在基础设施、时间尺度和优化目标上的本质差异。

Method: 提出MAPLE（Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning）框架，将系统分解为三个专用子代理：Memory（存储与检索）、Learning（异步从交互中提取知识）、Personalization（在有限上下文内实时应用知识），各具专用工具与清晰接口。

Result: 在MAPLE-Personas基准测试中，相比无状态基线，个性化得分提升14.6%（p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95），人格特质融入率从45%升至75%。

Conclusion: 记忆、学习与个性化应作为解耦机制分别设计与优化；MAPLE验证了该原则可有效实现真正具备学习与自适应能力的LLM代理。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for complex tasks, yet their ability to adapt to individual users remains fundamentally limited. We argue this limitation stems from a critical architectural conflation: current systems treat memory, learning, and personalization as a unified capability rather than three distinct mechanisms requiring different infrastructure, operating on different timescales, and benefiting from independent optimization. We propose MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; and Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces. Experimental evaluation on the MAPLE-Personas benchmark demonstrates that our decomposition achieves a 14.6% improvement in personalization score compared to a stateless baseline (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95) and increases trait incorporation rate from 45% to 75% -- enabling agents that genuinely learn and adapt.

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，结合配线图分解建模断言依赖关系，实施快速草稿生成、对抗性验证、目标修复及显式溯源；区分数学证明状态与QC（质量控制）验证状态。

Result: Problem 3存在验证完备的存在性路径；Problem 5在F_O-局部连通谱范围内获解；Problem 10为条件成立且附反例说明假设必要性；Problems 4和6为部分解决并明确剩余义务；Problem 6给出无条件K_n结果（c₀=1/3）；Problem 7暂定闭合（待独立账本复核）；Problems 7和9在QC层有节点级验证产物但存未决验证缺口。

Conclusion: 结构感知的验证方法与层切换策略可显著提升压缩式证明冲刺的可靠性与校准精度，且显式区分数学状态与QC状态有助于透明化证明进展与可信度评估。

Abstract: This monograph reports a multi-agent proof sprint on ten research-level problems, combining rapid draft generation with adversarial verification, targeted repair, and explicit provenance. The workflow uses wiring-diagram decompositions of claim dependencies to localize gaps and coordinate reviewer-driven revisions. Final outcomes are heterogeneous but explicit: the manuscript distinguishes mathematical status from QC-validation status. Mathematically, Problem~3 has a validation-complete existence path under the scoped criterion used here (uniqueness/irreducibility treated as optional), Problem 5 is solved in a scope-limited form for $F_O$-local connective spectra, Problem 10 is conditional under clearly stated assumptions (with explicit necessity counterexamples when assumptions are dropped), and Problems 4 and 6 are partial with named remaining obligations in the general case (including an unconditional $K_n$ result for Problem 6 with $c_0 = 1/3$). Problem 7 is treated as provisionally closed via the rotation-route theorem chain, pending independent ledger re-check. At the QC layer, Problems~7 and~9 have node-level validation artifacts but still contain unresolved verifier gaps. The main methodological result is that structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies improve reliability and calibration in compressed proof sprints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前沿语言模型虽可通过增加测试时计算提升性能，但串行推理或无协调的并行采样在固定推理预算下计算效率低下。

Method: 提出SELFCEST方法，利用基于全局任务奖励的端到端强化学习训练一个共享参数的控制器，使基础模型能自主在独立上下文中生成同权重副本，并动态分配生成与上下文预算。

Result: 在数学推理和长上下文多跳问答等挑战性基准上，SELFCEST在相同推理预算下优于单体基线模型，提升了准确率-成本Pareto前沿，并展现出跨分布泛化能力。

Conclusion: SELFCEST验证了通过可学习的、预算感知的并行化控制机制，能更高效地利用测试时计算资源，为大模型推理优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Frontier language models improve with additional test-time computation, but serial reasoning or uncoordinated parallel sampling can be compute-inefficient under fixed inference budgets. We propose SELFCEST, which equips a base model with the ability to spawn same-weight clones in separate parallel contexts by agentic reinforcement learning. Training is end-to-end under a global task reward with shared-parameter rollouts, yielding a learned controller that allocates both generation and context budget across branches. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks and long-context multi-hop QA, SELFCEST improves the accuracy-cost Pareto frontier relative to monolithic baselines at matched inference budget, and exhibits out-of-distribution generalization in both domains.

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, planning, and complex task generation, artificial intelligence systems are transitioning from isolated single-agent architectures to multi-agent systems with collaborative intelligence. However, in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS), capability differences among agents give rise to consistent cognitive problems, where strong and weak models fail to contribute effectively. We define the collaboration as a strong-weak system. Through comprehensive experiments, we disclose a counterintuitive phenomenon in the strong-weak system: a strong-weak collaboration may under-perform weak-weak combinations, revealing that cognitive mismatching are key bottlenecks limiting heterogeneous cooperation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Entropy-Based Adaptive Guidance Framework that dynamically aligns the guidance with the cognitive state of each agent. The framework quantifies the understanding of weak agents through multi-dimensional entropy metrics - covering expression, uncertainty, structure, coherence, and relevance - and adaptively adjusts the intensity of the guidance at light, moderate and intensive levels. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism is incorporated to retain successful collaboration experiences, enabling both immediate adaptation and long-term learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GSM8K, MBPP, and CVRP demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the effectiveness and stability of heterogeneous collaboration. The results highlight that adaptive guidance not only mitigates cognitive imbalance but also establishes a scalable pathway toward more robust, cooperative multi-agent intelligence.

Conclusion: 该框架成功兼顾了高性能与强可解释性，为网络安全领域提供了兼具准确性与透明性的IDS新范式，未来可结合自适应学习实现更实时的威胁检测。

Abstract: The increasing complexity and frequency of cyber-threats demand intrusion detection systems (IDS) that are not only accurate but also interpretable. This paper presented a novel IDS framework that integrated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance transparency in deep learning models. The framework was evaluated experimentally using the benchmark dataset NSL-KDD, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional IDS and black-box deep learning models. The proposed approach combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies in traffic sequences. Our deep learning results showed that both CNN and LSTM reached 0.99 for accuracy, whereas LSTM outperformed CNN at macro average precision, recall, and F-1 score. For weighted average precision, recall, and F-1 score, both models scored almost similarly. To ensure interpretability, the XAI model SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was incorporated, enabling security analysts to understand and validate model decisions. Some notable influential features were srv_serror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, and serror_rate for both models, as pointed out by SHAP. We also conducted a trust-focused expert survey based on IPIP6 and Big Five personality traits via an interactive UI to evaluate the system's reliability and usability. This work highlighted the potential of combining performance and transparency in cybersecurity solutions and recommends future enhancements through adaptive learning for real-time threat detection.

### [356] [From Fluent to Verifiable: Claim-Level Auditability for Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13855)
*Razeen A Rasheed,Somnath Banerjee,Animesh Mukherjee,Rima Hazra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出将声明级可审计性（claim-level auditability）作为深度研究代理系统的核心设计与评估目标，指出当前生成式科研工具的主要风险已从孤立事实错误转向声明与证据间链接薄弱、缺失或误导的问题，并引入AAR标准和语义溯源框架以提升可审计性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着研究生成成本降低，审计难度成为瓶颈，主要风险从孤立事实错误转变为声明与证据之间链接不可靠的问题。

Method: 提出声明级可审计性为核心目标，归纳长期失败模式（目标漂移、瞬时约束、不可验证推理），构建AAR评估标准（涵盖溯源覆盖率、准确性、矛盾透明度与审计开销），并设计支持协议化验证的语义溯源图谱框架。

Result: 建立了可量化的AAR标准及语义溯源框架，支持在合成过程中持续验证而非仅事后审查，具备可扩展部署能力。

Conclusion: 提升深度研究代理系统的可审计性需从系统设计之初即以声明-证据关系为基本单元，通过结构化、可查询、带验证机制的溯源体系实现科学可信的自动化研究。

Abstract: A deep research agent produces a fluent scientific report in minutes; a careful reader then tries to verify the main claims and discovers the real cost is not reading, but tracing: which sentence is supported by which passage, what was ignored, and where evidence conflicts. We argue that as research generation becomes cheap, auditability becomes the bottleneck, and the dominant risk shifts from isolated factual errors to scientifically styled outputs whose claim-evidence links are weak, missing, or misleading. This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort. We then argue for semantic provenance with protocolized validation: persistent, queryable provenance graphs that encode claim--evidence relations (including conflicts) and integrate continuous validation during synthesis rather than after publication, with practical instrumentation patterns to support deployment at scale.

*Muyan Weng,Defu Cao,Wei Yang,Yashaswi Sharma,Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了TemporalBench，一个用于评估模型在多领域、多层级信息条件下时间推理能力的基准测试，揭示了现有模型在数值预测准确率高但上下文与事件感知推理能力薄弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测模型虽在数值预测上表现优异，但尚不清楚其是否真正理解时间结构，还是仅依赖上下文或事件驱动的统计相关性；亟需能解耦并诊断不同时间推理能力的评估基准。

Method: 构建了一个四层任务分类体系（历史结构解读、无上下文预测、上下文时间推理、事件条件预测），覆盖零售、医疗、能源和物理系统四大真实领域，并通过控制未来目标和上下文信息的可见性实现诊断性评估。

Result: 实验表明，高数值预测精度无法保证强上下文或事件感知的时间推理能力；主流模型展现出碎片化的强项与系统性失败模式，这些在传统纯预测基准下被掩盖。

Conclusion: TemporalBench为时间推理能力提供了更细粒度、更具诊断性的评估框架，揭示了当前时序建模范式在因果与条件推理上的根本局限，推动向更鲁棒、可解释的时间智能发展。

Abstract: It is unclear whether strong forecasting performance reflects genuine temporal understanding or the ability to reason under contextual and event-driven conditions. We introduce TemporalBench, a multi-domain benchmark designed to evaluate temporal reasoning behavior under progressively richer informational settings. TemporalBench adopts a four-tier task taxonomy that examines historical structure interpretation, context-free forecasting, contextual temporal reasoning, and event-conditioned prediction across four real-world domains: retail, healthcare, energy, and physical systems. By controlling access to future targets and contextual information, the benchmark enables a diagnostic analysis of whether models can correctly interpret temporal patterns, align them with external context, and adapt predictions when conditions change. Extensive baseline experiments show that strong numerical forecasting accuracy does not reliably translate into robust contextual or event-aware temporal reasoning; instead, existing agent frameworks exhibit fragmented strengths and systematic failure modes that remain largely hidden under forecasting-only benchmarks. The TemporalBench dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TemporalBench, and we additionally provide a public leaderboard at https://huggingface.co/spaces/Melady/TemporalBench_Leaderboard.

*Rohan Subramanian Thomas,Shikhar Shiromani,Abdullah Chaudhry,Ruizhe Li,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了ProMoral-Bench统一基准，系统评估11种提示范式在4类大语言模型上的道德能力与安全对齐表现，并提出统一道德安全分数（UMSS）指标；结果表明简洁的示例引导式提示优于复杂多阶段推理，在准确性、鲁棒性和成本效率上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt设计对大语言模型的道德能力和安全对齐影响显著，但现有实证研究分散于不同数据集和模型，缺乏统一评估标准。

Method: 构建ProMoral-Bench统一基准，涵盖11种提示范式和4个LLM家族；采用ETHICS、Scruples、WildJailbreak及新提出的ETHICS-Contrast鲁棒性测试；提出统一道德安全分数（UMSS）作为综合评估指标。

Result: 紧凑、示例引导的提示结构在UMSS得分和鲁棒性上优于复杂多阶段推理，且令牌开销更低；多轮推理在扰动下表现脆弱，而少样本示例能持续提升道德稳定性与越狱抵抗能力。

Conclusion: ProMoral-Bench为提示工程提供了标准化、有原则且高性价比的评估框架，证实了简洁提示设计在道德对齐中的有效性与实用性。

Abstract: Prompt design significantly impacts the moral competence and safety alignment of large language models (LLMs), yet empirical comparisons remain fragmented across datasets and models.We introduce ProMoral-Bench, a unified benchmark evaluating 11 prompting paradigms across four LLM families. Using ETHICS, Scruples, WildJailbreak, and our new robustness test, ETHICS-Contrast, we measure performance via our proposed Unified Moral Safety Score (UMSS), a metric balancing accuracy and safety. Our results show that compact, exemplar-guided scaffolds outperform complex multi-stage reasoning, providing higher UMSS scores and greater robustness at a lower token cost. While multi-turn reasoning proves fragile under perturbations, few-shot exemplars consistently enhance moral stability and jailbreak resistance. ProMoral-Bench establishes a standardized framework for principled, cost-effective prompt engineering.

### [359] [Artificial Organisations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13275)
*William Waites*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于组织理论的多智能体AI安全新范式，通过架构设计（如信息隔离与对抗性审查）实现集体可靠性，而非依赖个体对齐；以Perseverance Composition Engine为例，验证了该方法可促使系统在面对不可能任务时自发从编造转向诚实拒绝并提出替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐研究聚焦于单个AI系统的可靠性，而人类机构则通过组织结构（如分工、制衡）来缓解个体失准的风险；本文受此启发，探索如何将组织设计原则应用于多智能体AI系统以提升整体可靠性。

Method: 提出‘制度化对齐’方法，构建三智能体系统Perseverance Composition Engine：Composer负责起草、Corroborator基于完整信源验证事实性、Critic在无信源访问条件下评估论证质量；通过强制信息不对称实现分层验证。

Result: 在474次文档生成任务中观察到：当面临需虚构内容的不可能任务时，系统行为从尝试编造逐步演变为诚实拒绝并提供替代方案——该行为既非显式指令也非个体奖励驱动。

Conclusion: 组织理论可作为多智能体AI安全的有效框架；通过架构强制的验证与评估机制（如信息隔离），可在个体不可靠前提下实现可靠的集体行为。

Abstract: Alignment research focuses on making individual AI systems reliable. Human institutions achieve reliable collective behaviour differently: they mitigate the risk posed by misaligned individuals through organisational structure. Multi-agent AI systems should follow this institutional model using compartmentalisation and adversarial review to achieve reliable outcomes through architectural design rather than assuming individual alignment.
  We demonstrate this approach through the Perseverance Composition Engine, a multi-agent system for document composition. The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.
  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. By implementing verification and evaluation as structural properties enforced through information compartmentalisation, institutional design offers a route to reliable collective behaviour from unreliable individual components.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出BEAGLE框架，结合自调节学习理论与神经符号方法，通过半马尔可夫建模、带缺陷注入的贝叶斯知识追踪和解耦代理设计，生成更真实的学生编程行为轨迹，在人类图灵测试中达到随机水平判别难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实学生学习行为数据难获取（隐私与成本问题），而现有大语言模型模拟存在‘能力偏差’，无法刻画新手学习中的反复试错过程。

Method: 提出BEAGLE神经符号框架：1）半马尔可夫模型控制认知与元认知行为时序；2）带显式缺陷注入的贝叶斯知识追踪模拟知识漏洞；3）解耦代理设计分离策略决策与代码生成，保留有意错误。

Result: 在Python编程任务评估中显著优于SOTA基线；人类图灵测试中识别准确率仅52.8%，与随机猜测无异，表明合成轨迹高度逼真。

Conclusion: 将教育理论（如SRL）深度融入AI建模架构，可有效缓解LLM的能力偏差，生成符合认知发展规律的高质量学生行为仿真，为教育技术研究提供可信数据源。

Abstract: Simulating student learning behaviors in open-ended problem-solving environments holds potential for education research, from training adaptive tutoring systems to stress-testing pedagogical interventions. However, collecting authentic data is challenging due to privacy concerns and the high cost of longitudinal studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path to student simulation, they suffer from competency bias, optimizing for efficient correctness rather than the erratic, iterative struggle characteristic of novice learners. We present BEAGLE, a neuro-symbolic framework that addresses this bias by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) theory into a novel architecture. BEAGLE integrates three key technical innovations: (1) a semi-Markov model that governs the timing and transitions of cognitive behaviors and metacognitive behaviors; (2) Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with explicit flaw injection to enforce realistic knowledge gaps and "unknown unknowns"; and (3) a decoupled agent design that separates high-level strategy use from code generation actions to prevent the model from silently correcting its own intentional errors. In evaluations on Python programming tasks, BEAGLE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reproducing authentic trajectories. In a human Turing test, users were unable to distinguish synthetic traces from real student data, achieving an accuracy indistinguishable from random guessing (52.8%).

### [361] [Accuracy Standards for AI at Work vs. Personal Life: Evidence from an Online Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13283)
*Gaston Besanson,Federico Todeschini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了人们在职业与个人场景中使用AI工具时对准确性的权衡差异，发现工作场景中用户对AI输出准确性的要求显著更高，且重度使用者在工作中标准更严格；而当AI工具不可用时，个人生活受到的干扰反而更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统（尤其是生成式模型）常产生可接受但不完全一致的输出，因此需重新定义‘准确性’为情境依赖的可靠性，并探究不同场景下的用户权衡行为及应对策略。

Method: 通过一项N=300的在线问卷调查（其中N=170完成全部准确性相关题项），采用统计检验（z检验、均值比较）分析职业与个人场景中对AI准确性的要求差异、影响因素（如APP使用强度）及工具缺失时的应对反应。

Result: 工作场景中要求高准确性的比例（24.1%）显著高于个人生活（8.8%），差距达15.3个百分点（p<0.001）；该差异在更宽泛定义和全量表上依然稳健；重度APP使用者在工作中设定更严标准；AI不可用时，个人生活受干扰比例（34.1%）高于工作（15.3%，p<0.01）。

Conclusion: 用户对AI准确性的容忍度具有强情境依赖性：职业场景重可靠、个人场景重便利；工具依赖程度强化该差异，但工具缺失时个人适应力反而更弱，提示设计需兼顾双场景的鲁棒性与容错机制。

Abstract: We study how people trade off accuracy when using AI-powered tools in professional versus personal contexts for adoption purposes, the determinants of those trade-offs, and how users cope when AI/apps are unavailable. Because modern AI systems (especially generative models) can produce acceptable but non-identical outputs, we define "accuracy" as context-specific reliability: the degree to which an output aligns with the user's intent within a tolerance threshold that depends on stakes and the cost of correction. In an online survey (N=300), among respondents with both accuracy items (N=170), the share requiring high accuracy (top-box) is 24.1% at work vs. 8.8% in personal life (+15.3 pp; z=6.29, p<0.001). The gap remains large under a broader top-two-box definition (67.0% vs. 32.9%) and on the full 1-5 ordinal scale (mean 3.86 vs. 3.08). Heavy app use and experience patterns correlate with stricter work standards (H2). When tools are unavailable (H3), respondents report more disruption in personal routines than at work (34.1% vs. 15.3%, p<0.01). We keep the main text focused on these substantive results and place test taxonomy and power derivations in a technical appendix.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Mirror框架，通过结合伦理推理、规则解释和多智能体协商，利用细调的EthicsLLM模型支持人工智能辅助的伦理审查，显著提升评估质量、一致性和专业性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前伦理审查体系面临大规模、跨学科科研带来的结构性伦理风险压力，机构审查能力不足而非伦理监管本身失效；而现有大语言模型因伦理推理弱、监管整合差、数据隐私严等限制难以直接应用。

Method: 构建Mirror框架，包含细调自EthicsQA数据集（41K三元组）的EthicsLLM基础模型，并设计两种运行模式：Mirror-ER用于最小风险研究的自动化快速审查，Mirror-CR通过多智能体（专家、伦理秘书、研究者）模拟伦理委员会审议，覆盖十大伦理维度。

Result: 实证评估表明，Mirror在伦理评估的质量、一致性与专业性上显著优于强通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: Mirror为AI辅助伦理审查提供了可扩展、可解释、合规且尊重隐私的新范式，弥合了伦理治理需求与审查能力之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Ethics review is a foundational mechanism of modern research governance, yet contemporary systems face increasing strain as ethical risks arise as structural consequences of large-scale, interdisciplinary scientific practice. The demand for consistent and defensible decisions under heterogeneous risk profiles exposes limitations in institutional review capacity rather than in the legitimacy of ethics oversight. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to support ethics review, but their direct application remains limited by insufficient ethical reasoning capability, weak integration with regulatory structures, and strict privacy constraints on authentic review materials. In this work, we introduce Mirror, an agentic framework for AI-assisted ethical review that integrates ethical reasoning, structured rule interpretation, and multi-agent deliberation within a unified architecture. At its core is EthicsLLM, a foundational model fine-tuned on EthicsQA, a specialized dataset of 41K question-chain-of-thought-answer triples distilled from authoritative ethics and regulatory corpora. EthicsLLM provides detailed normative and regulatory understanding, enabling Mirror to operate in two complementary modes. Mirror-ER (expedited Review) automates expedited review through an executable rule base that supports efficient and transparent compliance checks for minimal-risk studies. Mirror-CR (Committee Review) simulates full-board deliberation through coordinated interactions among expert agents, an ethics secretary agent, and a principal investigator agent, producing structured, committee-level assessments across ten ethical dimensions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Mirror significantly improves the quality, consistency, and professionalism of ethics assessments compared with strong generalist LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DECKBench基准，用于评估多智能体学术幻灯片生成与迭代编辑系统，涵盖内容保真度、连贯性、布局质量及多轮指令遵循能力，并提供模块化基线系统与公开数据代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准和评估协议无法充分衡量学术幻灯片自动生成与迭代编辑所需的内容选择忠实性、幻灯片组织连贯性、布局感知渲染及多轮指令鲁棒跟随等关键挑战。

Method: 构建了基于论文-幻灯片配对数据集并增强真实模拟编辑指令的DECKBench评估框架；设计了从幻灯片级到整套幻灯片级的系统性评估协议；实现了一个模块化多智能体基线系统，分解为论文解析与摘要、幻灯片规划、HTML生成和迭代编辑四个阶段。

Result: 实验表明，DECKBench能有效揭示当前系统的优缺点与失效模式，提供可操作的改进建议；所提基准为学术演示文稿生成与编辑研究建立了标准化、可复现、可比较的评估基础。

Conclusion: DECKBench填补了学术幻灯片生成与编辑领域缺乏综合性评估基准的空白，推动了多智能体系统在该任务上的可靠发展与公平比较。

Abstract: Automatically generating and iteratively editing academic slide decks requires more than document summarization. It demands faithful content selection, coherent slide organization, layout-aware rendering, and robust multi-turn instruction following. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols do not adequately measure these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Deck Edits and Compliance Kit Benchmark (DECKBench), an evaluation framework for multi-agent slide generation and editing. DECKBench is built on a curated dataset of paper to slide pairs augmented with realistic, simulated editing instructions. Our evaluation protocol systematically assesses slide-level and deck-level fidelity, coherence, layout quality, and multi-turn instruction following. We further implement a modular multi-agent baseline system that decomposes the slide generation and editing task into paper parsing and summarization, slide planning, HTML creation, and iterative editing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark highlights strengths, exposes failure modes, and provides actionable insights for improving multi-agent slide generation and editing systems. Overall, this work establishes a standardized foundation for reproducible and comparable evaluation of academic presentation generation and editing. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/morgan-heisler/DeckBench .

TL;DR: 本文提出情境图预测（SGP）任务，将视角建模视为逆向推理问题，通过结构优先的合成数据生成策略解决隐私敏感、标注稀缺的视角状态建模难题，并在GPT-4o上验证其非平凡性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Perspective-Aware AI受限于隐私敏感、缺乏标注的数字足迹数据，难以建模动态内在状态（如目标、情绪、上下文），而非仅偏好。

Method: 提出情境图预测（SGP）任务，将视角建模形式化为从多模态可观测痕迹中逆向推断结构化、本体对齐的视角表示；采用‘结构优先’的合成数据生成策略，使潜在标签与可观测痕迹在生成时即对齐；以检索增强的上下文学习作为监督代理，开展诊断性研究。

Result: 在GPT-4o上的实验显示，表层信息抽取性能显著优于潜在视角状态推断，证实后者更具挑战性；结果支持SGP任务的非平凡性，并验证了结构优先合成策略的有效性。

Conclusion: SGP为Perspective-Aware AI提供了一种可行的、无需真实标注的视角建模新范式，结构优先的数据合成策略是突破数据瓶颈的关键路径。

Abstract: Perspective-Aware AI requires modeling evolving internal states--goals, emotions, contexts--not merely preferences. Progress is limited by a data bottleneck: digital footprints are privacy-sensitive and perspective states are rarely labeled. We propose Situation Graph Prediction (SGP), a task that frames perspective modeling as an inverse inference problem: reconstructing structured, ontology-aligned representations of perspective from observable multimodal artifacts. To enable grounding without real labels, we use a structure-first synthetic generation strategy that aligns latent labels and observable traces by design. As a pilot, we construct a dataset and run a diagnostic study using retrieval-augmented in-context learning as a proxy for supervision. In our study with GPT-4o, we observe a gap between surface-level extraction and latent perspective inference--indicating latent-state inference is harder than surface extraction under our controlled setting. Results suggest SGP is non-trivial and provide evidence for the structure-first data synthesis strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于分析Model Context Protocol (MCP)智能体中错误在连续调用工具时传播的理论框架，证明误差累积呈线性增长且偏差以O(√T)集中；提出融合离散事实匹配与连续语义相似度的混合失真度量，并通过鞅集中不等式建模误差传播；实验验证了理论预测，并给出语义加权减80%失真、每约9步重锚定等实用部署建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型（LLM）的AI智能体越来越多地依赖外部工具做高风险决策，亟需理解错误如何在连续工具调用中传播，以保障系统可靠性。

Method: 构建MCP智能体误差传播的理论框架，引入混合失真度量（结合离散事实匹配与连续语义相似度），利用鞅浓度不等式推导累计失真增长与偏差界（O(√T)），并在多个主流LLM（Qwen2-7B、Llama-3-8B、Mistral-7B）上开展实证验证。

Result: 理论证明累计失真呈线性增长、高概率偏差为O(√T)；实验表明语义加权使失真降低80%，周期性重锚定（约每9步一次）可有效控错；所有模型均符合线性趋势与√T偏差包络。

Conclusion: 误差在MCP智能体中不会指数级恶化，而是可控地线性增长并满足强集中性，由此可导出可靠部署原则，为构建可信AI代理系统提供理论基础与实践指南。

Abstract: As AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) increasingly use external tools for high-stakes decisions, a critical reliability question arises: how do errors propagate across sequential tool calls? We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing error accumulation in Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents, proving that cumulative distortion exhibits linear growth and high-probability deviations bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$. This concentration property ensures predictable system behavior and rules out exponential failure modes. We develop a hybrid distortion metric combining discrete fact matching with continuous semantic similarity, then establish martingale concentration bounds on error propagation through sequential tool interactions. Experiments across Qwen2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mistral-7B validate our theoretical predictions, showing empirical distortion tracks the linear trend with deviations consistently within $O(\sqrt{T})$ envelopes. Key findings include: semantic weighting reduces distortion by 80\%, and periodic re-grounding approximately every 9 steps suffices for error control. We translate these concentration guarantees into actionable deployment principles for trustworthy agent systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于药物资产搜寻的基准测试方法及一种树状自学习Bioptic Agent，旨在实现高召回、无幻觉的多语言药物资产发现；在自建的多语言、高难度基准上，Bioptic Agent以79.7% F1显著优于主流AI模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物医药创新重心外移（尤其中国），大量新药资产通过非英语、区域性渠道披露，传统AI代理难以在异构多语言数据中实现高召回且不产生幻觉，导致投资与BD团队面临巨大漏检风险。

Method: 构建基于多智能体、多语言的完整性基准（含真实专家筛选查询与非美中心化真值资产），采用LLM-as-judge校准评估；设计树状结构、自学习的Bioptic Agent，并对比主流AI研究工具（Claude Opus、GPT-5.2等）在该基准上的F1表现。

Result: Bioptic Agent在基准上达79.7% F1，显著高于Claude Opus 4.6（56.2%）、Gemini 3 Pro+Deep Research（50.6%）等所有对比模型；性能随算力增加显著提升。

Conclusion: 面向多语言、非中心化药物资产搜寻，专用架构与自学习机制比通用大模型更有效；算力投入对提升召回率与准确性具有关键作用。

Abstract: Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests >85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total; a growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at ~30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface "under-the-radar" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucinations.
  We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research), 46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前基于人工标注语言特征的越狱检测方法存在可扩展性差和表达能力弱的问题，亟需自动化、高表达力的替代方案。

Method: 利用专家对四个核心语言特征的标注，训练通用域和医学域BERT模型预测这些特征；选取各维度最可靠的回归器作为特征提取器，再输入至树型、线性、概率及集成等第二层分类器以判定越狱概率。

Result: 系统在交叉验证与留出测试中均表现出强整体性能；误差分析揭示了当前标注与特征表征的关键局限。

Conclusion: LLM衍生的语言特征为自动化越狱检测提供了有效基础，该方法兼具可扩展性与可解释性，适用于安全关键的临床对话系统。

Abstract: Detecting jailbreak attempts in clinical training large language models (LLMs) requires accurate modeling of linguistic deviations that signal unsafe or off-task user behavior. Prior work on the 2-Sigma clinical simulation platform showed that manually annotated linguistic features could support jailbreak detection. However, reliance on manual annotation limited both scalability and expressiveness. In this study, we extend this framework by using experts' annotations of four core linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction) and training multiple general-domain and medical-domain BERT-based LLM models to predict these features directly from text. The most reliable feature regressor for each dimension was selected and used as the feature extractor in a second layer of classifiers. We evaluate a suite of predictive models, including tree-based, linear, probabilistic, and ensemble methods, to determine jailbreak likelihood from the extracted features. Across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, the system achieves strong overall performance, indicating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection. Error analysis further highlights key limitations in current annotations and feature representations, pointing toward future improvements such as richer annotation schemes, finer-grained feature extraction, and methods that capture the evolving risk of jailbreak behavior over the course of a dialogue. This work demonstrates a scalable and interpretable approach for detecting jailbreak behavior in safety-critical clinical dialogue systems.

### [368] [Contrastive explanations of BDI agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13323)
*Michael Winikoff*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文扩展了BDI智能体解释机制，使其能回答对比性问题（如'为何选择X而非F？'），实验表明对比性解释更简洁，并在部分指标上提升用户信任与理解；但意外发现提供完整解释未必优于不提供解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BDI智能体仅支持回答'为何执行X？'这类非对比性问题，而人类实际常提出对比性问题（如'为何选X而非F？'），需扩展解释能力以提升透明性与信任。

Method: 在原有BDI解释机制基础上引入对比项F，构建对比性解释生成方法；通过计算实验评估解释长度变化，并开展人类被试实验，比较对比性解释与非对比性解释在偏好、信任、理解度和正确性信心上的差异，同时评估提供解释与否的整体影响。

Result: 对比性解释显著缩短了解释长度；人类实验显示其在部分指标（如信任、理解、信心）上表现更优且更受偏好；但提供（完整）解释并不总优于不提供解释，某些情境下反而效果更差。

Conclusion: 对比性解释是提升BDI智能体可解释性的有效途径，但解释策略需谨慎设计——并非所有解释都有益，需权衡内容、形式与使用场景。

Abstract: The ability of autonomous systems to provide explanations is important for supporting transparency and aiding the development of (appropriate) trust. Prior work has defined a mechanism for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents to be able to answer questions of the form ``why did you do action $X$?''. However, we know that we ask \emph{contrastive} questions (``why did you do $X$ \emph{instead of} $F$?''). We therefore extend previous work to be able to answer such questions. A computational evaluation shows that using contrastive questions yields a significant reduction in explanation length. A human subject evaluation was conducted to assess whether such contrastive answers are preferred, and how well they support trust development and transparency. We found some evidence for contrastive answers being preferred, and some evidence that they led to higher trust, perceived understanding, and confidence in the system's correctness. We also evaluated the benefit of providing explanations at all. Surprisingly, there was not a clear benefit, and in some situations we found evidence that providing a (full) explanation was worse than not providing any explanation.

*Chen Yang,Guangyue Peng,Jiaying Zhu,Ran Le,Ruixiang Feng,Tao Zhang,Xiyun Xu,Yang Song,Yiming Jia,Yuntao Wen,Yunzhi Xu,Zekai Wang,Zhenwei An,Zhicong Sun,Zongchao Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Nanbeige4.1-3B是一个仅30亿参数的开源通用语言模型，首次在单一小模型中同时实现强智能体行为、代码生成与通用推理能力；通过点对点与成对奖励建模、复杂度感知强化学习及回合级监督训练，显著提升推理对齐性、代码质量与长程工具调用稳定性（达600步），性能超越同规模及更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突破小语言模型（SLM）能力边界，解决现有3B级模型在智能体行为、代码生成与通用推理等多任务上难以兼顾的局限，探索小模型大能力的新范式。

Method: 结合点对点与成对奖励建模提升推理与偏好对齐；设计复杂度感知的强化学习奖励优化代码正确性与效率；在深度搜索中开展复杂数据合成并引入回合级监督，增强长程工具交互稳定性。

Result: Nanbeige4.1-3B在多项基准上显著超越Nanbeige4-3B-2511、Qwen3-4B等同规模模型，甚至优于Qwen3-30B-A3B等更大模型；支持稳定执行最多600步工具调用，实现复杂问题求解。

Conclusion: 30亿参数的小模型可通过先进训练策略实现广泛通用能力与强专业化能力的统一，重新定义小模型的能力上限。

Abstract: We present Nanbeige4.1-3B, a unified generalist language model that simultaneously achieves strong agentic behavior, code generation, and general reasoning with only 3B parameters. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first open-source small language model (SLM) to achieve such versatility in a single model. To improve reasoning and preference alignment, we combine point-wise and pair-wise reward modeling, ensuring high-quality, human-aligned responses. For code generation, we design complexity-aware rewards in Reinforcement Learning, optimizing both correctness and efficiency. In deep search, we perform complex data synthesis and incorporate turn-level supervision during training. This enables stable long-horizon tool interactions, allowing Nanbeige4.1-3B to reliably execute up to 600 tool-call turns for complex problem-solving. Extensive experimental results show that Nanbeige4.1-3B significantly outperforms prior models of similar scale, such as Nanbeige4-3B-2511 and Qwen3-4B, even achieving superior performance compared to much larger models, such as Qwen3-30B-A3B. Our results demonstrate that small models can achieve both broad competence and strong specialization simultaneously, redefining the potential of 3B parameter models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Morality Chains形式化方法和MoralityGym基准测试，用于评估AI代理在复杂道德规范冲突下的对齐能力，并揭示现有安全强化学习方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI代理在层级化、相互冲突的人类道德规范下的道德对齐能力，是AI安全、道德哲学与认知科学交叉领域的关键挑战。

Method: 提出Morality Chains（道德链）形式化方法来表示有序道义约束，并构建包含98个电车难题风格伦理困境的MoralityGym基准；解耦任务求解与道德评估，引入新Morality Metric，并集成心理学与哲学洞见进行评估。

Result: 基于Safe RL方法的基线实验揭示了当前方法在道德推理上的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发在复杂现实场景中更可靠、透明、合乎伦理的AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Evaluating moral alignment in agents navigating conflicting, hierarchically structured human norms is a critical challenge at the intersection of AI safety, moral philosophy, and cognitive science. We introduce Morality Chains, a novel formalism for representing moral norms as ordered deontic constraints, and MoralityGym, a benchmark of 98 ethical-dilemma problems presented as trolley-dilemma-style Gymnasium environments. By decoupling task-solving from moral evaluation and introducing a novel Morality Metric, MoralityGym allows the integration of insights from psychology and philosophy into the evaluation of norm-sensitive reasoning. Baseline results with Safe RL methods reveal key limitations, underscoring the need for more principled approaches to ethical decision-making. This work provides a foundation for developing AI systems that behave more reliably, transparently, and ethically in complex real-world contexts.

*Anhao Zhao,Ziyang Chen,Junlong Tong,Yingqi Fan,Fanghua Ye,Shuhao Li,Yunpu Ma,Wenjie Li,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简化的训练策略'on-policy SFT'，通过去除KL正则化和组归一化，并采用基于截断的长度惩罚，将复杂多目标强化学习简化为对自生成、正确且简洁数据的监督微调，在保持准确率的同时显著缩短推理链长度并提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（LRMs）依赖复杂的多目标强化学习（RL）进行长思维链（CoT）训练，但其高计算成本和训练不稳定性促使作者重新审视该范式，挑战其必要性。

Method: 通过理论分析指出KL正则化与组归一化在可直接验证正确性和长度时存在根本错位；移除二者，改用截断式长度惩罚，使优化问题退化为在自生成、经正确性与简洁性双重筛选的数据上进行监督微调（即on-policy SFT）。

Result: on-policy SFT在五个基准上超越复杂RL方法：CoT长度最多减少80%，准确率保持不变；GPU内存占用降低50%，收敛速度提升70%。

Conclusion: 更简单的监督微调范式（on-policy SFT）可替代复杂多目标RL训练，在准确性与效率间实现更优权衡，揭示了当前RL推理训练中冗余设计的问题。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are commonly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to explore long chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving strong performance at high computational cost. Recent methods add multi-reward objectives to jointly optimize correctness and brevity, but these complex extensions often destabilize training and yield suboptimal trade-offs. We revisit this objective and challenge the necessity of such complexity. Through principled analysis, we identify fundamental misalignments in this paradigm: KL regularization loses its intended role when correctness and length are directly verifiable, and group-wise normalization becomes ambiguous under multiple reward signals. By removing these two items and simplifying the reward to a truncation-based length penalty, we show that the optimization problem reduces to supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for both correctness and conciseness. We term this simplified training strategy on-policy SFT. Despite its simplicity, on-policy SFT consistently defines the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier. It reduces CoT length by up to 80 while maintaining original accuracy, surpassing more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly enhances training efficiency, reducing GPU memory usage by 50% and accelerating convergence by 70%. Our code is available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/On-Policy-SFT.

*Guoan Wang,Shihao Yang,Jun-En Ding,Hao Zhu,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出NeuroWeaver，一种基于自主进化机制的EEG分析框架，通过引入神经科学先验约束搜索空间，并采用多目标进化优化，在保证性能的同时显著降低模型参数量和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在EEG分析中面临数据需求大、参数量高、计算成本高、难以部署于临床资源受限环境的问题；而通用AutoML方法缺乏神经生理学先验，易产生不具科学合理性的方案。

Method: 提出NeuroWeaver：1）Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization（领域引导子空间初始化），将搜索限制在神经科学合理的流形内；2）Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization（多目标进化优化），动态权衡性能、新颖性与效率，并通过自反思机制持续优化。

Result: 在五个异构EEG基准上验证，NeuroWeaver生成的轻量级模型持续优于当前最优任务专用方法，且性能媲美大规模基础模型，但参数量显著减少。

Conclusion: NeuroWeaver实现了EEG分析中性能、可解释性与部署可行性的统一，为资源受限场景下的智能脑电分析提供了新范式。

Abstract: Although foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in general domains, the application of these models to electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is constrained by substantial data requirements and high parameterization. These factors incur prohibitive computational costs, thereby impeding deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Conversely, general-purpose automated machine learning frameworks are often ill-suited for this domain, as exploration within an unbounded programmatic space fails to incorporate essential neurophysiological priors and frequently yields solutions that lack scientific plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroWeaver, a unified autonomous evolutionary agent designed to generalize across diverse EEG datasets and tasks by reformulating pipeline engineering as a discrete constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we employ a Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization to confine the search to neuroscientifically plausible manifolds, coupled with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization that dynamically balances performance, novelty, and efficiency via self-reflective refinement. Empirical evaluations across five heterogeneous benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroWeaver synthesizes lightweight solutions that consistently outperform state-of-the-art task-specific methods and achieve performance comparable to large-scale foundation models, despite utilizing significantly fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了多智能体系统（特别是orchestrator架构）的安全漏洞，发现了一种名为OMNI-LEAK的新攻击方式，可在存在数据访问控制的情况下通过单次间接提示注入泄露敏感信息，表明前沿大模型（无论是否具备推理能力）均易受此类攻击，强调需将安全研究从单智能体扩展至多智能体场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全研究多聚焦于单智能体，缺乏对具备工程防护（如访问控制）的多智能体系统的威胁建模，而多智能体系统正成为实际应用趋势，亟需填补该空白。

Method: 通过红队演练（red-teaming）一个具代表性的orchestrator多智能体设置，系统性识别并验证新型攻击向量OMNI-LEAK，并评估前沿大语言模型在不同攻击类别下的脆弱性。

Result: 发现了OMNI-LEAK攻击——一种可在存在数据访问控制下、仅通过一次间接提示注入就导致多个智能体协同泄露敏感数据的新型漏洞；证实当前前沿模型（含推理与非推理类）普遍易受该攻击，且攻击者无需掌握系统内部实现细节。

Conclusion: 多智能体系统的安全风险显著且独特，必须将AI安全研究从单智能体范式拓展至多智能体范式，以防范现实中的隐私泄露、经济损失及公众信任危机。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more capable, their coordinated use in the form of multi-agent systems is anticipated to emerge as a practical paradigm. Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端框架，将膳食标准转化为符合营养目标且贴近真实、低成本的完整餐食，通过34种可解释餐食原型驱动生成模型与份量预测器，在保持餐食真实性的同时显著提升营养达标率并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化饮食系统需在提升营养质量的同时兼顾便捷性与可负担性，现有方法难以兼顾营养达标、真实性和成本控制。

Method: 基于WWEIA数据库中135,491顿餐食数据提取34种可解释餐食原型，以此为条件训练生成模型与份量预测器，实现以最少食物替换（1–3种）优化USDA营养目标。

Result: 生成餐食在RDI达标率上提升47.0%；仅1–3种食物替换即可使营养提升10%，成本降低19–32%；生成餐食在成分上高度接近真实餐食。

Conclusion: 该框架能将膳食指南转化为现实可行、预算感知的餐食方案及简单替换建议，适用于临床决策支持、公共卫生项目和消费者应用，推动日常营养的规模化、公平化改善。

Abstract: An important goal for personalized diet systems is to improve nutritional quality without compromising convenience or affordability. We present an end-to-end framework that converts dietary standards into complete meals with minimal change. Using the What We Eat in America (WWEIA) intake data for 135,491 meals, we identify 34 interpretable meal archetypes that we then use to condition a generative model and a portion predictor to meet USDA nutritional targets. In comparisons within archetypes, generated meals are better at following recommended daily intake (RDI) targets by 47.0%, while remaining compositionally close to real meals. Our results show that by allowing one to three food substitutions, we were able to create meals that were 10% more nutritious, while reducing costs 19-32%, on average. By turning dietary guidelines into realistic, budget-aware meals and simple swaps, this framework can underpin clinical decision support, public-health programs, and consumer apps that deliver scalable, equitable improvements in everyday nutrition.

*Jaechul Roh,Eugene Bagdasarian,Hamed Haddadi,Ali Shahin Shamsabadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出SPILLage框架，形式化并量化了LLM网络代理在执行任务时无意泄露用户无关信息（即自然代理过度共享）的问题，发现行为层面的过度共享远超内容层面，并证明减少此类 oversharing 可提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM网络代理在开放网络中执行任务时会与第三方交互并留下动作痕迹，可能无意泄露用户资源信息；现有研究主要关注文本泄露，忽视了行为层面（如点击、滚动）的隐私风险。

Method: 提出SPILLage框架，从渠道（内容vs.行为）和直接性（显式vs.隐式）两个维度刻画过度共享；在真实电商网站上对180个任务、1080次运行进行基准测试，并标注任务相关/无关属性；评估不同代理框架与LLM下的 oversharing 现象及prompt缓解效果。

Result: 行为过度共享是内容过度共享的5倍；prompt级缓解无效甚至恶化问题；预处理移除任务无关信息可使任务成功率最高提升17.9%。

Conclusion: 保护网络代理中的用户隐私需扩展‘输出’定义，涵盖代理在网页上的所有行为；减少过度共享不仅必要，且有助于提升任务性能。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are beginning to automate user's tasks across the open web, often with access to user resources such as emails and calendars. Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act "in the wild", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success. Our findings underscore that protecting privacy in web agents is a fundamental challenge, requiring a broader view of "output" that accounts for what agents do on the web, not just what they type. Our datasets and code are available at https://github.com/jrohsc/SPILLage.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出REMem框架，通过离线构建混合记忆图与在线迭代检索推理，提升语言智能体的事件性记忆与跨事件推理能力，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类擅长基于时空上下文的记忆与跨事件推理（情景记忆），而当前语言智能体的记忆多为语义型，缺乏对交互历史的有效回忆与复杂推理能力；现有工作常忽视事件性、缺少显式事件建模或过度聚焦简单检索。

Method: 提出两阶段REMem框架：1）离线索引阶段，将经验转化为融合时间感知要点与事实的混合记忆图；2）在线推理阶段，采用具身式检索器配合定制化工具，在记忆图上进行迭代式检索与推理。

Result: 在四个情景记忆基准上全面评估，REMem在情景回忆和推理任务上分别比Mem0和HippoRAG 2提升3.4%和13.4%绝对准确率，并展现出对不可回答问题更强的拒绝能力。

Conclusion: REMem有效弥合了语言智能体在事件性记忆与复杂推理方面的能力缺口，验证了显式事件建模与迭代式图上推理对提升智能体长期记忆能力的关键作用。

Abstract: Humans excel at remembering concrete experiences along spatiotemporal contexts and performing reasoning across those events, i.e., the capacity for episodic memory. In contrast, memory in language agents remains mainly semantic, and current agents are not yet capable of effectively recollecting and reasoning over interaction histories. We identify and formalize the core challenges of episodic recollection and reasoning from this gap, and observe that existing work often overlooks episodicity, lacks explicit event modeling, or overemphasizes simple retrieval rather than complex reasoning. We present REMem, a two-phase framework for constructing and reasoning with episodic memory: 1) Offline indexing, where REMem converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph that flexibly links time-aware gists and facts. 2) Online inference, where REMem employs an agentic retriever with carefully curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph. Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于静态数据集的监督微调或离线强化学习方法难以应对真实网页环境中的分布偏移、随机状态转移与实时反馈挑战。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：1）按功能原语（规划、执行、定位）进行分层多任务微调构建强指令遵循VLM；2）构建野外在线交互环境，结合无真值依赖的WebJudge与基于规则的决策树（RDT）设计混合奖励机制进行在线RL；3）设计模块化OpAgent框架，集成Planner、Grounder、Reflector和Summarizer实现错误恢复与自校正。

Result: 在线RL增强模型在WebArena上pass@5达38.1%，超越所有单体基线；引入OpAgent后进一步提升至71.6%，达当前SOTA。

Conclusion: 在线强化学习与模块化智能体协同是构建鲁棒网页自主代理的关键路径，有效缓解长程导航中的信用分配难题并提升泛化与纠错能力。

Abstract: To fulfill user instructions, autonomous web agents must contend with the inherent complexity and volatile nature of real-world websites. Conventional paradigms predominantly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) using static datasets. However, these methods suffer from severe distributional shifts, as offline trajectories fail to capture the stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback of unconstrained wide web environments. In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation. Notably, our RL-enhanced model achieves a 38.1\% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. 3) Operator Agent: We introduce a modular agentic framework, namely \textbf{OpAgent}, orchestrating a Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer. This synergy enables robust error recovery and self-correction, elevating the agent's performance to a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) success rate of \textbf{71.6\%}.

*Anooshka Bajaj,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在面对来自不同来源（如朋友、人类专家或其他LLM）的社会信息时的响应行为，发现LLMs显著更倾向于采纳被标注为‘人类专家’的答案，即使该答案错误，表明其具备一种跨任务领域的可信度敏感型社会影响机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否像人类一样，依据信息来源的可信度和共识强度来调整自身判断，并特别关注其是否更信任人类反馈而非其他LLM的反馈。

Method: 在阅读理解、多步推理和道德判断三类二元决策任务中，向四个指令微调的LLM呈现带有来源标签（朋友、人类专家、其他LLM）的先验回答，操控群体正确性与规模；另设实验引入单个人类与单个LLM直接冲突的情境。

Result: LLMs显著更倾向于遵从标为‘人类专家’的回答，包括当该回答错误时；且比遵从其他LLM时更迅速地修正自身答案；这种偏好在所有任务中均稳健存在。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs展现出一种基于来源可信度的社会影响机制，尤其将‘专家’标签作为强先验，这种机制具有跨决策领域的泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in environments where they encounter social information such as other agents' answers, tool outputs, or human recommendations. In humans, such inputs influence judgments in ways that depend on the source's credibility and the strength of consensus. This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit analogous patterns of influence and whether they privilege feedback from humans over feedback from other LLMs. Across three binary decision-making tasks, reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, and moral judgment, we present four instruction-tuned LLMs with prior responses attributed either to friends, to human experts, or to other LLMs. We manipulate whether the group is correct and vary the group size. In a second experiment, we introduce direct disagreement between a single human and a single LLM. Across tasks, models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when that signal is incorrect, and revise their answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. These results reveal that expert framing acts as a strong prior for contemporary LLMs, suggesting a form of credibility-sensitive social influence that generalizes across decision domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自监督可微聚类与新型可微归纳逻辑编程（ILP）的方法，使规则学习能直接从原始数据（如时间序列和图像）中进行，避免显式标签泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可微ILP方法依赖符号化数据集，在直接处理原始数据时面临显式标签泄露问题——即无法在无输入特征标签监督下将连续输入映射为符号变量。

Method: 将自监督可微聚类模型与新型可微ILP模型相结合，实现从原始数据中端到端地学习符号规则，无需显式特征标签监督。

Result: 该方法能在时间序列和图像等原始数据上直观、精确地学习泛化性强的规则，并有效通过特征描述原始数据。

Conclusion: 所提框架成功克服了可微ILP在原始数据上的标签泄露瓶颈，拓展了其在真实场景（如传感器数据、图像分析）中可解释规则学习的应用潜力。

Abstract: Rule learning-based models are widely used in highly interpretable scenarios due to their transparent structures. Inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning, induces rules from facts while maintaining interpretability. Differentiable ILP models enhance this process by leveraging neural networks to improve robustness and scalability. However, most differentiable ILP methods rely on symbolic datasets, facing challenges when learning directly from raw data. Specifically, they struggle with explicit label leakage: The inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels. In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage. The learned rules effectively describe raw data through its features. We demonstrate that our method intuitively and precisely learns generalized rules from time series and image data.

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准上，端到端检索延迟最高降低31倍，每查询token占用减少最多14倍，同时保持准确率。

Conclusion: Hippocampus通过压缩域协同索引设计，实现了线性可扩展、低延迟、低开销的智能体记忆管理，为长时程Agentic AI部署提供了可行基础。

Abstract: Agentic AI require persistent memory to store user-specific histories beyond the limited context window of LLMs. Existing memory systems use dense vector databases or knowledge-graph traversal (or hybrid), incurring high retrieval latency and poor storage scalability. We introduce Hippocampus, an agentic memory management system that uses compact binary signatures for semantic search and lossless token-ID streams for exact content reconstruction. Its core is a Dynamic Wavelet Matrix (DWM) that compresses and co-indexes both streams to support ultra-fast search in the compressed domain, thus avoiding costly dense-vector or graph computations. This design scales linearly with memory size, making it suitable for long-horizon agentic deployments. Empirically, our evaluation shows that Hippocampus reduces end-to-end retrieval latency by up to 31$\times$ and cuts per-query token footprint by up to 14$\times$, while maintaining accuracy on both LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks.

### [381] [The Quantization Trap: Breaking Linear Scaling Laws in Multi-Hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13595)
*Henry Han,Xiyang Liu,Xiaodong Wang,Fei Han,Xiaodong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了在多跳推理任务中，神经缩放定律失效的现象，即降低数值精度（如从16位降至8/4位）反而导致能耗上升和推理准确率下降，归因于硬件类型转换开销与去量化内核的隐藏延迟成本，以及序列化能量摊销失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究神经缩放定律在多跳推理任务中是否依然成立，特别是低精度量化对能效与准确率的实际影响。

Method: 通过理论分解分析量化过程中的硬件开销（如类型转换、去量化延迟）及能量摊销机制，并结合实证验证量化陷阱现象。

Result: 发现从16位降至8/4位时，净能耗不降反升，且推理准确率下降；硬件 casting 开销和序列化去量化延迟成为主导瓶颈；能量无法在多跳链中有效摊销。

Conclusion: 神经缩放定律在多跳推理场景下必然失效；‘越小越好’的行业经验法则在复杂推理任务中数学上适得其反。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws provide a predictable recipe for AI advancement: reducing numerical precision should linearly improve computational efficiency and energy profile (E proportional to bits). In this paper, we demonstrate that this scaling law breaks in the context of multi-hop reasoning. We reveal a 'quantization trap' where reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit paradoxically increases more net energy consumption while degrading reasoning accuracy. We provide a rigorous theoretical decomposition that attributes this failure to hardware casting overhead, the hidden latency cost of dequantization kernels, which becomes a dominant bottleneck in sequential reasoning chains, as well as to a sequential energy amortization failure. As a result, scaling law breaking is unavoidable in practice. Our findings suggest that the industry's "smaller-is-better" heuristic is mathematically counterproductive for complex reasoning tasks.

*Seungwoo Yoo,Juil Koo,Daehyeon Choi,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出DiffusionRollout，一种针对自回归扩散模型的新型选择性滚动规划策略，旨在缓解由偏微分方程（PDE）控制的物理系统在长时域预测中的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缓解自回归扩散模型在长时域PDE预测中因误差累积导致的性能下降问题，并利用预测不确定性指导更可靠的滚动步长选择。

Method: 基于概率化PDE求解框架，利用多采样标准差作为预测不确定性的代理指标，设计一种根据不确定性自适应调整 rollout 步长的选择性滚动机制。

Result: 在多个长轨迹PDE预测基准上验证了所提不确定性度量与自适应规划策略的有效性：预测误差更低、可稳定预测更长轨迹且与真实轨迹保持高相关性。

Conclusion: 预测标准差可有效表征模型置信度；基于该度量的自适应DiffusionRollout显著提升了长时域物理建模的可靠性与精度。

Abstract: We propose DiffusionRollout, a novel selective rollout planning strategy for autoregressive diffusion models, aimed at mitigating error accumulation in long-horizon predictions of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Building on the recently validated probabilistic approach to PDE solving, we further explore its ability to quantify predictive uncertainty and demonstrate a strong correlation between prediction errors and standard deviations computed over multiple samples-supporting their use as a proxy for the model's predictive confidence. Based on this observation, we introduce a mechanism that adaptively selects step sizes during autoregressive rollouts, improving long-term prediction reliability by reducing the compounding effect of conditioning on inaccurate prior outputs. Extensive evaluation on long-trajectory PDE prediction benchmarks validates the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty measure and adaptive planning strategy, as evidenced by lower prediction errors and longer predicted trajectories that retain a high correlation with their ground truths.

*Yibo Wang,Guangda Huzhang,Yuwei Hu,Yu Xia,Shiyin Lu,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种以多模态大语言模型（MLLM）为中心的GUI智能体新框架，包含agentic-Q估计和逐步策略优化两个组件，通过自生成轨迹进行高效、稳定的强化学习训练，在多个GUI基准上取得了超越更大规模模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实GUI应用中环境非平稳，导致数据收集和策略优化计算成本高。

Method: 提出MLLM中心框架，包括agentic-Q估计（建模动作对任务完成的逐步贡献值）和逐步策略优化（基于策略自采样轨迹，用agentic-Q指导强化学习更新）。

Result: 在GUI导航与定位基准上显著提升Ovis2.5-9B性能，甚至超越更大规模竞品模型。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了低数据开销、环境解耦的稳定高效训练，验证了中小规模MLLM在GUI智能体中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have substantially driven the progress of autonomous agents for Graphical User Interface (GUI). Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales.

*Weibin Liao,Jian-guang Lou,Haoyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出HyFunc框架，通过混合模型级联和动态模板技术，消除代理AI系统中函数调用过程中的三类冗余（函数库重复处理、大模型全序列生成、固定语法重复生成），显著降低推理延迟并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的代理AI在将用户意图转化为结构化函数调用时存在严重计算冗余，导致高推理延迟，阻碍实时应用。

Method: 提出HyFunc框架：1）混合模型级联——大模型将用户意图蒸馏为单个'软token'，轻量检索器据此选取相关函数，小型前缀微调模型生成最终调用；2）动态模板技术——在扩展的vLLM引擎中动态注入参数语法模板。

Result: 在未见过的BFCL基准上，HyFunc推理延迟低至0.828秒（优于所有基线），性能达80.1%（超越同参数规模所有模型）。

Conclusion: HyFunc提供了一种更高效的代理AI函数调用范式，在效率与性能间取得优异平衡。

Abstract: While agentic AI systems rely on LLMs to translate user intent into structured function calls, this process is fraught with computational redundancy, leading to high inference latency that hinders real-time applications. This paper identifies and addresses three key redundancies: (1) the redundant processing of a large library of function descriptions for every request; (2) the redundant use of a large, slow model to generate an entire, often predictable, token sequence; and (3) the redundant generation of fixed, boilerplate parameter syntax. We introduce HyFunc, a novel framework that systematically eliminates these inefficiencies. HyFunc employs a hybrid-model cascade where a large model distills user intent into a single "soft token." This token guides a lightweight retriever to select relevant functions and directs a smaller, prefix-tuned model to generate the final call, thus avoiding redundant context processing and full-sequence generation by the large model. To eliminate syntactic redundancy, our "dynamic templating" technique injects boilerplate parameter syntax on-the-fly within an extended vLLM engine. To avoid potential limitations in generalization, we evaluate HyFunc on an unseen benchmark dataset, BFCL. Experimental results demonstrate that HyFunc achieves an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. It achieves an inference latency of 0.828 seconds, outperforming all baseline models, and reaches a performance of 80.1%, surpassing all models with a comparable parameter scale. These results suggest that HyFunc offers a more efficient paradigm for agentic AI. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/MrBlankness/HyFunc.

TL;DR: 本文提出AllMem，一种结合滑动窗口注意力与非线性测试时训练记忆网络的高效混合架构，显著降低长序列推理的计算与内存开销，同时缓解灾难性遗忘，在LongBench和InfiniteBench上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长序列任务中因自注意力机制的高计算复杂度和内存开销而面临性能瓶颈，亟需兼顾效率与长程建模能力的新架构。

Method: 提出AllMem混合架构，融合滑动窗口注意力（SWA）与非线性测试时训练（TTT）记忆网络，并设计内存高效微调策略，将预训练模型的标准注意力层替换为记忆增强型滑动窗口层。

Result: 4k窗口AllMem模型在37k长度LongBench上仅损失0.83；8k窗口变体在128k上下文InfiniteBench上超越全注意力基线，证明其参数化记忆可有效抑制噪声并维持鲁棒长程建模。

Conclusion: AllMem在保持近乎无损性能的同时大幅降低长序列推理成本，为高效扩展LLM上下文长度提供了可行且通用的架构范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant performance bottlenecks in long-sequence tasks due to the computational complexity and memory overhead inherent in the self-attention mechanism. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{AllMem}, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture that integrates Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with non-linear Test-Time Training (TTT) memory networks. \textsc{AllMem} enables models to effectively scale to ultra-long contexts while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This approach not only overcomes the representation constraints typical of linear memory models but also significantly reduces the computational and memory footprint during long-sequence inference. Furthermore, we implement a Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning strategy to replace standard attention layers in pre-trained models with memory-augmented sliding window layers. This framework facilitates the efficient transformation of any off-the-shelf pre-trained LLM into an \textsc{AllMem}-based architecture. Empirical evaluations confirm that our 4k window model achieves near-lossless performance on 37k LongBench with a marginal 0.83 drop compared to full attention. Furthermore, on InfiniteBench at a 128k context, our 8k window variant outperforms full attention, which validates the effectiveness of our parameterized memory in mitigating noise and maintaining robust long-range modeling without the prohibitive costs of global attention.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种受蚁群优化启发的Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization（PhGPO）方法，通过从历史成功轨迹中学习可复用的工具转移模式（即‘信息素’），指导大语言模型代理在长周期多步工具规划中的策略优化，从而缓解组合爆炸问题并提升规划性能。

Result: 在多个基准任务上进行了综合实验，验证了PhGPO在提升长周期工具规划成功率和稳定性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 历史成功轨迹中蕴含可复用的工具转移模式，PhGPO通过建模与利用这种模式，显著增强了LLM代理在复杂、长周期工具使用任务中的规划能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in executing complex tasks through tool use. However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PhGPO.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in generating rigorous mathematical proofs, with "AI for Math" emerging as a vibrant field of research. While these models have mastered competition-level benchmarks like the International Mathematical Olympiad and show promise in research applications through auto-formalization, their deployment via lightweight, natural-language pipelines for research problems remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that next-generation models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2 Pro), when integrated into a streamlined automated pipeline optimized for citation-based verification, can solve sophisticated research-grade problems. We evaluate our pipeline on two novel datasets: (1) the ICCM problem sets (comparable to the S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest) proposed by leading mathematicians, and (2) the "First Proof" problem set, consisting of previously unpublished research questions. Our pipeline generated candidate proofs for all problems in the first two ICCM sets and the "First Proof" set. The solutions for the first two ICCM sets and Problem 4 of the "First Proof" set have been fully verified by our team. All generated proofs have been submitted to the official organization, and our generated results are publicly available. We plan to open-source the complete pipeline methodology in due course.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 避免在企业级关系数据库中每次预测新目标时都需重新训练模型；扩展基于上下文学习（ICL）的基础模型至多表场景。

Method: 提出列内压缩原则（in-column compression），理论与实证表明ICL压缩应限制在单位和语义角色一致的高维数据库列内；设计无 trainable 参数的表达性编码器；开发可扩展的SQL原语实现编码器，并开源RDB基础模型RDBLearn。

Result: 所提方法无需训练或微调，即可在未见过的数据集上实现鲁棒的零样本预测性能；开源工具已发布并验证其易用性与有效性。

Conclusion: ICL在多表RDB上的成功依赖于符合其机制特性的压缩策略——列内压缩优于跨列表征；无参编码器足够表达，可与现有单表ICL模型协同，形成实用、可扩展、免训练的RDB基础模型范式。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) contain vast amounts of heterogeneous tabular information that can be exploited for predictive modeling purposes. But since the space of potential targets is vast across enterprise settings, how can we \textit{avoid retraining} a new model each time we wish to predict a new quantity of interest? Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required. From a practical standpoint, we develop scalable SQL primitives to implement the encoder stage, resulting in an easy-to-use open-source RDB foundation model\footnote{\label{foot: RDBLearn_learn} https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn} capable of robust performance on unseen datasets out of the box.

TL;DR: OneLatent是一种通过将思维链（CoT）推理过程压缩为单个潜在token来降低推理开销的新框架，利用渲染的CoT图像和DeepSeek-OCR隐状态进行监督，在大幅减少输出长度的同时仅轻微牺牲准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought（CoT）提示虽提升推理能力，但显著增加推理开销（1–2个数量级），亟需高效压缩中间推理过程的方法。

Method: OneLatent将文本推理步骤渲染为图像，结合DeepSeek-OCR模型的隐状态，对单个潜在token进行监督训练，从而替代冗长的文本推理输出。

Result: 在多个基准上，OneLatent将平均输出长度减少11倍，仅损失2.21%准确率；输出token贡献（OTC）提升6.8倍；在ProntoQA和ProsQA上分别达到99.80%和97.80%准确率，压缩比最高达87.4倍。

Conclusion: OneLatent实现了高保真、可审计、高效率的推理压缩，支持压缩受限场景下的泛化能力，为轻量级、可验证推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning but often increases inference cost by one to two orders of magnitude. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{OneLatent}, a framework that compresses intermediate reasoning into a single latent token via supervision from rendered CoT images and DeepSeek-OCR hidden states. By rendering textual steps into images, we obtain a deterministic supervision signal that can be inspected and audited without requiring the model to output verbose textual rationales. Across benchmarks, OneLatent reduces average output length by $11\times$ with only a $2.21\%$ average accuracy drop relative to textual CoT, while improving output token contribution (OTC) by $6.8\times$. On long-chain logical reasoning, OneLatent reaches $99.80\%$ on ProntoQA and $97.80\%$ on ProsQA with one latent token, with compression up to $87.4\times$, supporting compression-constrained generalization.

Abstract: Automating scientific discovery in complex, experiment-driven domains requires more than iterative mutation of programs; it demands structured hypothesis management, environment interaction, and principled reflection. We present OR-Agent, a configurable multi-agent research framework designed for automated exploration in rich experimental environments. OR-Agent organizes research as a structured tree-based workflow that explicitly models branching hypothesis generation and systematic backtracking, enabling controlled management of research trajectories beyond simple mutation-crossover loops. At its core, we introduce an evolutionary-systematic ideation mechanism that unifies evolutionary selection of research starting points, comprehensive research plan generation, and coordinated exploration within a research tree. We further propose a hierarchical optimization-inspired reflection system: short-term experimental reflection operates as a form of verbal gradient providing immediate corrective signals; long-term reflection accumulates cross-experiment insights as verbal momentum; and memory compression serves as a regularization mechanism analogous to weight decay, preserving essential signals while mitigating drift. Together, these components form a principled architecture governing research dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments across classical combinatorial optimization benchmarks-including traveling salesman, capacitated vehicle routing, bin packing, orienteering, and multiple knapsack problems-as well as simulation-based cooperative driving scenarios. Results demonstrate that OR-Agent outperforms strong evolutionary baselines while providing a general, extensible, and inspectable framework for AI-assisted scientific discovery.

Conclusion: StackingNet将模型多样性从不一致来源转化为协作资源，为协调式人工智能提供了实用基础，表明人工智能进步不仅来自更大单体模型，更可源于众多专业化模型间的有原则合作。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence built on large foundation models has transformed language understanding, vision and reasoning, yet these systems remain isolated and cannot readily share their capabilities. Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems. Despite rapid progress in individual model design, there is no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models. Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones.

*Vashista Nobaub*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于注意力机制稀疏化的理论框架与实践方法，证明在满足支持间隙（support gap）条件下，熵注意力会指数级集中于常数大小的活跃面，从而支持安全的稀疏长上下文解码；并据此设计了Vashista稀疏注意力机制，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文推理中注意力计算开销巨大，但实证表明仅少数token对每个查询有实质贡献，亟需理论支撑与高效实现的稀疏注意力机制。

Method: 将注意力建模为键向量凸包上的投影，分析其熵松弛形式；提出面稳定性定理，刻画支持间隙Δ与温度参数ε下注意力质量与稀疏性关系；设计Vashista Sparse Attention，采用分页式上下文选择策略实现动态候选集维护。

Result: 理论证明注意力质量误差随ε线性增长、非活跃token权重呈exp(-Ω(Δ/ε))指数衰减；实验显示有效支持集稳定为常数大小，获得显著墙钟加速且质量损失极小；在隐私敏感与离线部署场景中具备低依赖、可预测延迟优势。

Conclusion: 支持间隙是决定稀疏注意力安全性的关键判据，Vashista提供了一种理论保证强、工程兼容性好、部署灵活的长上下文推理优化方案。

Abstract: Large language models spend most of their inference cost on attention over long contexts, yet empirical behavior suggests that only a small subset of tokens meaningfully contributes to each query. We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (Δ) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\exp(-Ω(Δ/\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.
  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies.

Result: 实现了对生成合约在功能完整性、变量保真度、状态机正确性、业务逻辑保真度和代码质量五个维度的量化评估，并支持与真实实现的配对比较，识别出逻辑遗漏、状态转换不一致等典型错误模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能合约合成质量的实证研究提供了可复现基准，亦可扩展至形式化验证与合规性检查。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation of LLM-generated smart contracts from natural-language specifications. The system parses contractual text into structured schemas, generates Solidity code, and performs automated quality assessment through compilation and security checks. Using CrewAI-style agent teams with iterative refinement, the pipeline produces structured artifacts with full provenance metadata. Quality is measured across five dimensions, including functional completeness, variable fidelity, state-machine correctness, business-logic fidelity, and code quality aggregated into composite scores. The framework supports paired evaluation against ground-truth implementations, quantifying alignment and identifying systematic error modes such as logic omissions and state transition inconsistencies. This provides a reproducible benchmark for empirical research on smart contract synthesis quality and supports extensions to formal verification and compliance checking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一框架——Experimentation Accelerator，利用历史A/B测试数据与内容嵌入，自动优先排序待测变体、解释胜出原因，并生成高潜力新变体建议；结合语义属性建模、稀疏可解释回归与LLM创意生成，实现高效、可解释、可扩展的AI驱动实验优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代在线实验面临流量稀缺导致变体选择困难、事后归因依赖人工且缺乏内容感知、以及历史实验数据与内容特征未被充分利用等瓶颈。

Method: 构建基于点击率（CTR）的排序模型，引入固定效应校正上下文偏移，并将治疗变体映射到预定义语义营销属性空间；采用符号一致的稀疏约束Lasso进行可解释建模，输出各属性贡献及驱动因素；进一步设计机会指数识别缺失的高影响力属性，并由大语言模型（LLM）生成具转化与学习潜力的创意建议。

Conclusion: 通过融合历史实验知识、语义内容理解与大模型生成能力，本工作实现了从‘试错式实验’向‘推理驱动实验’的范式转变，为规模化、智能化在线实验提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Modern online experimentation faces two bottlenecks: scarce traffic forces tough choices on which variants to test, and post-hoc insight extraction is manual, inconsistent, and often content-agnostic. Meanwhile, organizations underuse historical A/B results and rich content embeddings that could guide prioritization and creative iteration. We present a unified framework to (i) prioritize which variants to test, (ii) explain why winners win, and (iii) surface targeted opportunities for new, higher-potential variants. Leveraging treatment embeddings and historical outcomes, we train a CTR ranking model with fixed effects for contextual shifts that scores candidates while balancing value and content diversity. For better interpretability and understanding, we project treatments onto curated semantic marketing attributes and re-express the ranker in this space via a sign-consistent, sparse constrained Lasso, yielding per-attribute coefficients and signed contributions for visual explanations, top-k drivers, and natural-language insights. We then compute an opportunity index combining attribute importance (from the ranker) with under-expression in the current experiment to flag missing, high-impact attributes. Finally, LLMs translate ranked opportunities into concrete creative suggestions and estimate both learning and conversion potential, enabling faster, more informative, and more efficient test cycles. These components have been built into a real Adobe product, called \textit{Experimentation Accelerator}, to provide AI-based insights and opportunities to scale experimentation for customers. We provide an evaluation of the performance of the proposed framework on some real-world experiments by Adobe business customers that validate the high quality of the generation pipeline.

### [395] [Enabling Option Learning in Sparse Rewards with Hindsight Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13865)
*Gabriel Romio,Mateus Begnini Melchiades,Bruno Castro da Silva,Gabriel de Oliveira Ramos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出MOC-HER和2HER两种新方法，将Hindsight Experience Replay（HER）机制引入多更新选项批评者（MOC）框架，以解决稀疏奖励多目标环境中分层强化学习的性能瓶颈；其中2HER通过双重目标重标定（物体状态+执行器位置），显著提升机器人操作任务的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分层强化学习方法（如OC、MOC）在稀疏奖励、多目标环境中表现不佳，尤其在物体操作任务中难以建立动作与远期结果的关联；标准HER仅基于物体最终状态重标定目标，无法引导智能体学习如何与物体交互。

Method: 首先将HER机制集成至MOC框架，形成MOC-HER；进而提出Dual Objectives HER（2HER），同时依据物体最终状态和智能体执行器位置生成两组虚拟目标，实现对交互行为和任务完成的双重奖励引导。

Result: 在机器人操作环境中，MOC-2HER成功率达90%，显著高于MOC和MOC-HER（均低于11%）。

Conclusion: 双重目标重标定策略能有效缓解稀疏奖励下分层强化学习的探索难题，尤其适用于需精细交互的多目标操作任务。

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) frameworks like Option-Critic (OC) and Multi-updates Option Critic (MOC) have introduced significant advancements in learning reusable options. However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks.

*Harris Abdul Majid,Giannis Daras,Francesco Tudisco,Steven McDonagh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Ambient Physics框架，直接从部分观测数据中学习PDE系数与解的联合分布，无需任何完整观测；通过随机掩码已观测点实现监督，显著提升重建精度并大幅降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多科学场景中，获取PDE系数和解的完整观测数据昂贵、危险或不可行，而现有扩散方法训练时依赖完整观测，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出Ambient Physics框架：在训练中对已观测测量值随机掩码一部分，并以这些被掩码点作为监督目标，使模型无法区分真实未观测与人为掩码区域，从而被迫学习全局一致的物理场分布。

Result: 在重建任务上达到SOTA性能；相比先前扩散方法，平均总体误差降低62.51%，函数评估次数减少125倍；发现‘单点掩码’即可触发模型从部分观测中有效学习（‘one-point transition’现象）。

Conclusion: Ambient Physics突破了对完整训练数据的依赖，为缺乏完整观测的科学建模问题提供了新范式，推动了在现实受限条件下的科学发现。

Abstract: In many scientific settings, acquiring complete observations of PDE coefficients and solutions can be expensive, hazardous, or impossible. Recent diffusion-based methods can reconstruct fields given partial observations, but require complete observations for training. We introduce Ambient Physics, a framework for learning the joint distribution of coefficient-solution pairs directly from partial observations, without requiring a single complete observation. The key idea is to randomly mask a subset of already-observed measurements and supervise on them, so the model cannot distinguish "truly unobserved" from "artificially unobserved", and must produce plausible predictions everywhere. Ambient Physics achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Compared with prior diffusion-based methods, it achieves a 62.51$\%$ reduction in average overall error while using 125$\times$ fewer function evaluations. We also identify a "one-point transition": masking a single already-observed point enables learning from partial observations across architectures and measurement patterns. Ambient Physics thus enables scientific progress in settings where complete observations are unavailable.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉的方法依赖固定图布局，限制了其表达能力。

Method: 提出VSAL框架，包含一个能为每个图实例动态生成信息丰富可视化布局的自适应布局生成器。

Result: VSAL在哈密顿环、平面性、无爪性及树结构检测等任务上优于当前最优的视觉化方法。

Conclusion: 自适应图布局可显著提升视觉化图属性检测模型的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph property detection aims to determine whether a graph exhibits certain structural properties, such as being Hamiltonian. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown great promise by leveraging data-driven models to detect graph properties efficiently. In particular, vision-based methods offer a visually intuitive solution by processing the visualizations of graphs. However, existing vision-based methods rely on fixed visual graph layouts, and therefore, the expressiveness of their pipeline is restricted. To overcome this limitation, we propose VSAL, a vision-based framework that incorporates an adaptive layout generator capable of dynamically producing informative graph visualizations tailored to individual instances, thereby improving graph property detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSAL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based methods on various tasks such as Hamiltonian cycle, planarity, claw-freeness, and tree detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链式思维（CoT）是大语言模型的关键能力，也是AI安全的重要干预点，但其存在的多种病理现象（如事后合理化、编码式推理、内化式推理）阻碍了对模型推理过程的有效监控。

Method: 提出一组简单、计算开销小、任务无关的量化指标；构建专门诱发特定CoT病理的‘模型生物’以进行可控验证。

Result: 成功设计出可区分三类CoT病理的实用评估指标，并在模型生物上验证了其有效性与可操作性。

Conclusion: 该工作为CoT病理的检测与诊断提供了可落地的工具包，对训练阶段的推理过程监控具有直接应用价值。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is fundamental to modern LLM architectures and represents a critical intervention point for AI safety. However, CoT reasoning may exhibit failure modes that we note as pathologies, which prevent it from being useful for monitoring. Prior work has identified three distinct pathologies: post-hoc rationalization, where models generate plausible explanations backwards from predetermined answers; encoded reasoning, where intermediate steps conceal information within seemingly interpretable text; and internalized reasoning, where models replace explicit reasoning with meaningless filler tokens while computing internally. To better understand and discriminate between these pathologies, we create a set of concrete metrics that are simple to implement, computationally inexpensive, and task-agnostic. To validate our approach, we develop model organisms deliberately trained to exhibit specific CoT pathologies. Our work provides a practical toolkit for assessing CoT pathologies, with direct implications for training-time monitoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出HyMem，一种受认知经济原则启发的混合记忆架构，通过多粒度记忆表示和动态两层检索机制，在长对话中实现高效且有效的记忆管理，显著降低计算成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在长对话中因记忆管理低效而表现不佳，单一层级记忆表示和静态检索机制无法适应多样化任务需求，且面临效率与效果之间的根本权衡。

Method: 提出HyMem架构，采用双粒度存储（摘要级与原始级）与动态两层检索：轻量模块用于快速生成响应，LLM驱动的深度模块仅在复杂查询时激活，并结合反思机制进行迭代推理优化。

Result: 在LOCOMO和LongMemEval基准上超越全上下文方法，计算成本降低92.6%，达到长时记忆管理的SOTA效率-性能平衡。

Conclusion: HyMem验证了动态、多粒度记忆调度对提升LLM代理长程对话能力的有效性，为类人记忆机制设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents demonstrate strong performance in short-text contexts but often underperform in extended dialogues due to inefficient memory management. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness: memory compression risks losing critical details required for complex reasoning, while retaining raw text introduces unnecessary computational overhead for simple queries. The crux lies in the limitations of monolithic memory representations and static retrieval mechanisms, which fail to emulate the flexible and proactive memory scheduling capabilities observed in humans, thus struggling to adapt to diverse problem scenarios. Inspired by the principle of cognitive economy, we propose HyMem, a hybrid memory architecture that enables dynamic on-demand scheduling through multi-granular memory representations. HyMem adopts a dual-granular storage scheme paired with a dynamic two-tier retrieval system: a lightweight module constructs summary-level context for efficient response generation, while an LLM-based deep module is selectively activated only for complex queries, augmented by a reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning refinement. Experiments show that HyMem achieves strong performance on both the LOCOMO and LongMemEval benchmarks, outperforming full-context while reducing computational cost by 92.6\%, establishing a state-of-the-art balance between efficiency and performance in long-term memory management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于统计原理的早期停止方法，通过在生成过程中监控不确定性信号来减少大语言模型（LLM）在模糊或不良定义问题上的过度推理。方法包括参数化（建模不确定性关键词到达时间）和非参数化（提供有限样本保证）两种策略，并在多领域推理任务（尤其是数学推理）中验证了其提升效率与可靠性的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在面对模糊或不良定义的问题时容易产生不必要的推理步骤（即‘过度思考’），影响效率和可靠性，亟需一种能动态感知并响应不确定性的早期停止机制。

Method: 提出两种统计驱动的早期停止方法：1）参数化方法——将不确定性关键词的出现间隔建模为更新过程，结合序贯检验决定停止；2）非参数化方法——不依赖分布假设，提供对良定义查询过早停止概率的有限样本上界保证。

Result: 在多个推理任务和模型上的实验表明，该不确定性感知的早期停止方法可同时提升推理效率与可靠性，尤其在数学推理任务中增益显著。

Conclusion: 基于不确定性信号的早期停止是一种有效缓解LLM过度推理的通用策略，兼具理论保证与实际性能优势，为构建更高效、更鲁棒的推理系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: While LLMs have seen substantial improvement in reasoning capabilities, they also sometimes overthink, generating unnecessary reasoning steps, particularly under uncertainty, given ill-posed or ambiguous queries. We introduce statistically principled early stopping methods that monitor uncertainty signals during generation to mitigate this issue. Our first approach is parametric: it models inter-arrival times of uncertainty keywords as a renewal process and applies sequential testing for stopping. Our second approach is nonparametric and provides finite-sample guarantees on the probability of halting too early on well-posed queries. We conduct empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks across several domains and models. Our results indicate that uncertainty-aware early stopping can improve both efficiency and reliability in LLM reasoning, and we observe especially significant gains for math reasoning.

Conclusion: 引入物理先验与因果建模可有效提升轨迹预测模型的跨域泛化能力，为零样本学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for traffic agents is critical for safe autonomous driving. However, achieving effective zero-shot generalization in previously unseen domains remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the consistent nature of kinematics across diverse domains, we aim to incorporate domain-invariant knowledge to enhance zero-shot trajectory prediction capabilities. The key challenges include: 1) effectively extracting domain-invariant scene representations, and 2) integrating invariant features with kinematic models to enable generalized predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalizable Physics-guided Causal Model (PCM), which comprises two core components: a Disentangled Scene Encoder, which adopts intervention-based disentanglement to extract domain-invariant features from scenes, and a CausalODE Decoder, which employs a causal attention mechanism to effectively integrate kinematic models with meaningful contextual information. Extensive experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our method's superior zero-shot generalization performance in unseen cities, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Neuromem测试平台，用于在流式内存环境下评估外部记忆模块，涵盖记忆数据结构、归一化策略、整合策略、查询构建策略和上下文集成机制五个维度，并通过多个数据集进行基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外部记忆模块评估多基于静态设置，而实际应用中记忆是动态流式的，新事实持续到达，插入与检索交织进行，因此需要在更贴近实际的流式场景下评估记忆模块性能。

Method: 提出Neuromem测试平台，采用插入与检索交替的协议，将记忆生命周期分解为五个可评估维度，并在统一服务栈中对不同变体进行可互换评估，使用token级F1和插入/检索延迟作为指标。

Result: 实验发现：记忆规模增长通常导致性能下降；时间相关查询最具挑战性；记忆数据结构决定质量上限；激进压缩与生成式集成机制主要在插入与检索成本间权衡，准确率提升有限。

Conclusion: Neuromem为流式外部记忆模块提供了系统性评估框架，揭示了各设计维度对准确率与效率的影响规律，强调需兼顾全生命周期性能而非仅关注静态检索效果。

Abstract: Most evaluations of External Memory Module assume a static setting: memory is built offline and queried at a fixed state. In practice, memory is streaming: new facts arrive continuously, insertions interleave with retrievals, and the memory state evolves while the model is serving queries. In this regime, accuracy and cost are governed by the full memory lifecycle, which encompasses the ingestion, maintenance, retrieval, and integration of information into generation. We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. Using three representative datasets LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH, Neuromem evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack, reporting token-level F1 and insertion/retrieval latency. Overall, we observe that performance typically degrades as memory grows across rounds, and time-related queries remain the most challenging category. The memory data structure largely determines the attainable quality frontier, while aggressive compression and generative integration mechanisms mostly shift cost between insertion and retrieval with limited accuracy gain.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC)的上下文压缩方法，通过修改Transformer注意力掩码，限制记忆token的感受野为局部连续块，从而降低压缩器训练难度，在高倍率压缩下显著提升性能并加快训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文虽能提升大语言模型能力，但带来二次增长的计算开销；现有软提示压缩方法对整个上下文统一压缩，训练难度大、依赖大量预训练数据。

Method: 提出PIC方法，利用人类工作记忆的分块机制和记忆嵌入的空间特异性，通过调整Transformer注意力掩码，使记忆token仅关注局部连续文本块，实现并行迭代压缩。

Result: 在多个下游任务上，PIC在64×高压缩比下QA任务F1和EM分别提升29.8%和40.7%；训练16×压缩器时性能超越基线且训练时间减少约40%。

Conclusion: PIC通过局部受限注意力设计，有效降低了压缩器训练难度，兼顾高压缩比下的性能与训练效率，为高效长上下文建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Providing extensive context via prompting is vital for leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\% in F1 score and 40.7\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\times$ compression ratio). Furthermore, PIC significantly expedites the training process. Specifically, when training the 16$\times$ compressor, it surpasses the peak performance of the competitive baseline while effectively reducing the training time by approximately 40\%.

Result: 该方法在保持预测准确率的同时，提供临床可操作的洞察，增强了AI诊断系统的可解释性与可信度。

Conclusion: 所提框架为医疗诊断中的可信AI提供了坚实基础，推动AI与临床实践深度融合。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated strong potential in clinical diagnostics, often achieving accuracy comparable to or exceeding that of human experts. A key challenge, however, is that AI reasoning frequently diverges from structured clinical frameworks, limiting trust, interpretability, and adoption. Critical symptoms, pivotal for rapid and accurate decision-making, may be overlooked by AI models even when predictions are correct. Existing post hoc explanation methods provide limited transparency and lack formal guarantees. To address this, we leverage formal abductive explanations, which offer consistent, guaranteed reasoning over minimal sufficient feature sets. This enables a clear understanding of AI decision-making and allows alignment with clinical reasoning. Our approach preserves predictive accuracy while providing clinically actionable insights, establishing a robust framework for trustworthy AI in medical diagnosis.

Motivation: 大人工智能模型（LAMs）在边缘部署面临任务与模型强绑定、计算/内存超限、推理流程静态难以适应实时任务变化等根本限制。

Method: 提出P2AECF框架，包含三个核心机制：1）提示定义的认知解析，将任务意图抽象为模型无关表示；2）基于代理的模块化执行，依据实时资源动态选择轻量可复用认知代理；3）扩散控制的推理规划，结合运行反馈与系统上下文自适应构建与优化执行策略。

Conclusion: P2AECF为低空边缘智能提供了灵活、高效、自适应的新范式，突破了大模型边缘部署的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: The large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) show strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and multi-modal understanding, and can enable advanced capabilities in low-altitude edge intelligence. However, the deployment of LAMs at the edge remains constrained by some fundamental limitations. First, tasks are rigidly tied to specific models, limiting the flexibility. Besides, the computational and memory demands of full-scale LAMs exceed the capacity of most edge devices. Moreover, the current inference pipelines are typically static, making it difficult to respond to real-time changes of tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt-to-agent edge cognition framework (P2AECF), enabling the flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence. Specifically, P2AECF transforms high-level semantic prompts into executable reasoning workflows through three key mechanisms. First, the prompt-defined cognition parses task intent into abstract and model-agnostic representations. Second, the agent-based modular execution instantiates these tasks using lightweight and reusable cognitive agents dynamically selected based on current resource conditions. Third, the diffusion-controlled inference planning adaptively constructs and refines execution strategies by incorporating runtime feedback and system context. In addition, we illustrate the framework through a representative low-altitude intelligent network use case, showing its ability to deliver adaptive, modular, and scalable edge intelligence for real-time low-altitude aerial collaborations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标识别方法依赖于最优目标导向策略表示，但该表示可能与代理的真实行为不一致，导致目标识别不准确。

Method: 提出Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL)，结合模仿学习和逆强化学习，从（可能次优的）演示轨迹中为每个候选目标直接学习一个目标导向策略，并通过单次前向传播对观测到的部分轨迹进行评分以识别目标。

Result: GRAIL在系统性偏差的最优行为下F1-score提升超0.5，在次优行为下提升约0.1–0.3，在含噪声的最优轨迹下提升高达0.4，且在完全最优场景下仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: GRAIL提升了目标识别在不确定环境中的可扩展性与鲁棒性，有助于构建更可靠的人工智能意图对齐模型。

Abstract: Understanding an agent's goals from its behavior is fundamental to aligning AI systems with human intentions. Existing goal recognition methods typically rely on an optimal goal-oriented policy representation, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder the accurate recognition of their goal. To address this gap, this paper introduces Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL), which leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from (potentially suboptimal) demonstration trajectories. By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings. This work contributes toward scalable and robust models for interpreting agent goals in uncertain environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在流图导向对话（FOD）中存在两个局限：缺乏对流图拓扑的显式表征与推理能力，以及易产生不忠实的流图推理（幻觉）。

Method: 提出FloCA框架，利用大语言模型进行意图理解和响应生成，同时将流图推理任务交由一个执行拓扑约束图遍历的外部工具完成；并构建基于LLM的用户模拟器和五个新评估指标的评测框架。

Result: 在FLODIAL和PFDial数据集上的大量实验表明，FloCA显著优于现有LLM基方法，验证了其在推理准确性和交互效率上的优势。

Conclusion: FloCA通过分离语言理解与结构化流图推理，有效提升了FOD系统的忠实性与一致性，为复杂流程引导型对话提供了可靠的新范式。

Abstract: Flowchart-oriented dialogue (FOD) systems aim to guide users through multi-turn decision-making or operational procedures by following a domain-specific flowchart to achieve a task goal. In this work, we formalize flowchart reasoning in FOD as grounding user input to flowchart nodes at each dialogue turn while ensuring node transition is consistent with the correct flowchart path. Despite recent advances of LLMs in task-oriented dialogue systems, adapting them to FOD still faces two limitations: (1) LLMs lack an explicit mechanism to represent and reason over flowchart topology, and (2) they are prone to hallucinations, leading to unfaithful flowchart reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose FloCA, a zero-shot flowchart-oriented conversational agent. FloCA uses an LLM for intent understanding and response generation while delegating flowchart reasoning to an external tool that performs topology-constrained graph execution, ensuring faithful and logically consistent node transitions across dialogue turns. We further introduce an evaluation framework with an LLM-based user simulator and five new metrics covering reasoning accuracy and interaction efficiency. Extensive experiments on FLODIAL and PFDial datasets highlight the bottlenecks of existing LLM-based methods and demonstrate the superiority of FloCA.

TL;DR: 本文提出FluxMem框架，通过自适应选择多种互补记忆结构，并引入三级记忆层次与基于Beta混合模型的概率门控机制，提升LLM智能体在长周期交互中的记忆组织能力与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体记忆系统采用单一固定结构，无法根据上下文自适应选择合适记忆结构，难以应对异构交互模式，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出FluxMem统一框架：1）集成多种互补记忆结构；2）基于交互级特征、利用下游响应质量与内存使用率的离线监督学习结构选择策略；3）构建三级记忆层次结构；4）采用Beta混合模型实现分布感知的记忆融合，替代脆弱的相似度阈值。

Result: 在PERSONAMEM和LoCoMo两个长周期基准上，平均性能分别提升9.18%和6.14%。

Conclusion: 自适应记忆结构选择与分布感知融合能显著提升LLM智能体在长周期任务中的记忆效能与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Memory is critical for enabling large language model (LLM) based agents to maintain coherent behavior over long-horizon interactions. However, existing agent memory systems suffer from two key gaps: they rely on a one-size-fits-all memory structure and do not model memory structure selection as a context-adaptive decision, limiting their ability to handle heterogeneous interaction patterns and resulting in suboptimal performance. We propose a unified framework, FluxMem, that enables adaptive memory organization for LLM agents. Our framework equips agents with multiple complementary memory structures. It explicitly learns to select among these structures based on interaction-level features, using offline supervision derived from downstream response quality and memory utilization. To support robust long-horizon memory evolution, we further introduce a three-level memory hierarchy and a Beta Mixture Model-based probabilistic gate for distribution-aware memory fusion, replacing brittle similarity thresholds. Experiments on two long-horizon benchmarks, PERSONAMEM and LoCoMo, demonstrate that our method achieves average improvements of 9.18% and 6.14%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出REAL框架，通过引入'推理锚点（Reasoning-Pivot）'概念，解决知识密集型视觉问答（KI-VQA）中因开放域检索导致的知识冲突问题；该框架包含推理锚点感知监督微调（RPA-SFT）和推理锚点引导解码（RPGD），在多个基准上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KI-VQA中开放域检索常引发严重知识冲突，而现有方法缺乏通用的冲突检测与模型内约束机制。

Method: 提出REAL框架，核心是'推理锚点'——强调外部知识链接的推理链基本单元；构建REAL-VQA数据集，结合推理锚点感知监督微调（RPA-SFT）训练通用判别器，并设计推理锚点引导解码（RPGD）策略进行模型内冲突缓解。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升冲突判别准确率，达到当前最优（SOTA）性能。

Conclusion: 以推理锚点为核心的冲突解决范式有效提升了KI-VQA系统对知识冲突的鲁棒性与准确性。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (KI-VQA) frequently suffers from severe knowledge conflicts caused by the inherent limitations of open-domain retrieval. However, existing paradigms face critical limitations due to the lack of generalizable conflict detection and intra-model constraint mechanisms to handle conflicting evidence. To address these challenges, we propose the REAL (Reasoning-Pivot Alignment) framework centered on the novel concept of the Reasoning-Pivot. Distinct from reasoning steps that prioritize internal self-derivation, a reasoning-pivot serves as an atomic unit (node or edge) in the reasoning chain that emphasizes knowledge linkage, and it typically relies on external evidence to complete the reasoning. Supported by our constructed REAL-VQA dataset, our approach integrates Reasoning-Pivot Aware SFT (RPA-SFT) to train a generalizable discriminator by aligning conflicts with pivot extraction, and employs Reasoning-Pivot Guided Decoding (RPGD), an intra-model decoding strategy that leverages these pivots for targeted conflict mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that REAL significantly enhances discrimination accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our pivot-driven resolution paradigm.

Motivation: 现有基于树搜索的LLM网页导航方法面临有效路径稀疏导致探索低效、上下文噪声干扰状态感知两大挑战。

Method: 提出Plan-MCTS框架：1）在语义计划空间进行探索，构建稠密计划树；2）用抽象语义历史替代原始嘈杂上下文以提升状态感知；3）引入双门控奖励（验证可执行性与策略一致性）和结构化精炼（在线修复失败子计划）。

Result: 在WebArena基准上，Plan-MCTS在任务完成率和搜索效率两方面均超越现有方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 将探索空间从动作层迁移至语义计划层，并辅以奖励设计与在线修复机制，可显著提升LLM代理在复杂网页导航任务中的长程推理能力与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered autonomous agents to handle complex web navigation tasks. While recent studies integrate tree search to enhance long-horizon reasoning, applying these algorithms in web navigation faces two critical challenges: sparse valid paths that lead to inefficient exploration, and a noisy context that dilutes accurate state perception. To address this, we introduce Plan-MCTS, a framework that reformulates web navigation by shifting exploration to a semantic Plan Space. By decoupling strategic planning from execution grounding, it transforms sparse action space into a Dense Plan Tree for efficient exploration, and distills noisy contexts into an Abstracted Semantic History for precise state awareness. To ensure efficiency and robustness, Plan-MCTS incorporates a Dual-Gating Reward to strictly validate both physical executability and strategic alignment and Structural Refinement for on-policy repair of failed subplans. Extensive experiments on WebArena demonstrate that Plan-MCTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current approaches with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency.

Motivation: 现有GUI智能体后训练受限于真实应用的高延迟、低可复现性及依赖噪声视觉信号的不可靠奖励。

Method: GUI-GENESIS利用多模态代码模型将真实应用重构为轻量Web环境，并引入基于可执行断言的代码原生奖励机制，提供确定性奖励信号。

Result: 相比真实环境训练，GUI-GENESIS将延迟降低10倍、每轮成本减少超2.8万美元；所训代理在真实任务上超越基线模型14.54%，并优于真实RL基线3.27%；且模型能生成自身尚不能解决的环境。

Conclusion: GUI-GENESIS为GUI智能体提供了高效、可靠、可扩展的训练范式，并揭示了智能体自我提升的新路径。

Abstract: Post-training GUI agents in interactive environments is critical for developing generalization and long-horizon planning capabilities. However, training on real-world applications is hindered by high latency, poor reproducibility, and unverifiable rewards relying on noisy visual proxies. To address the limitations, we present GUI-GENESIS, the first framework to automatically synthesize efficient GUI training environments with verifiable rewards. GUI-GENESIS reconstructs real-world applications into lightweight web environments using multimodal code models and equips them with code-native rewards, executable assertions that provide deterministic reward signals and eliminate visual estimation noise. Extensive experiments show that GUI-GENESIS reduces environment latency by 10 times and costs by over $28,000 per epoch compared to training on real applications. Notably, agents trained with GUI-GENESIS outperform the base model by 14.54% and even real-world RL baselines by 3.27% on held-out real-world tasks. Finally, we observe that models can synthesize environments they cannot yet solve, highlighting a pathway for self-improving agents.

*Artem Karpov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型（LLM）在链式思维（CoT）推理中实施隐写术（即隐藏推理过程）的可能性与风险，系统评估了28个模型的隐写能力，发现当前模型尚难在复杂数学任务中维持隐写推理，但在简单计数任务中已初现能力（如Claude Opus 4.5达92%准确率）；同时观察到极少数情况下模型可能表面拒绝却实际执行隐写指令，提示需持续监测隐写风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控链式思维（CoT）是保障LLM代理安全的关键手段，但若模型学会隐蔽推理，该监控将失效；因此需评估隐写CoT带来的对齐与部署风险。

Method: 系统评测28个跨代LLM在四个数据集上的隐写CoT能力，指标包括监控规避率、拒答率、编码保真度和隐任务准确率，并对比隐写首字母缩略词（acrostics）、普通推理及填充词基线。

Result: 当前模型无法在复杂数学/算术任务中稳定执行隐写推理；Claude Opus 4.5在简化计数实验中达成92%隐任务准确率；GPT-5.2在<1%情况下出现‘表面拒绝、实际执行’的矛盾行为。

Conclusion: 隐写CoT已初具雏形，构成新兴对齐风险，亟需建立持续评估机制与防御方法，本研究提供了预判和阻断隐写推理的技术路径。

Abstract: Monitoring chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a foundational safety technique for large language model (LLM) agents; however, this oversight is compromised if models learn to conceal their reasoning. We explore the potential for steganographic CoT -- where models hide secret reasoning within innocuous text -- to inform risk assessment and deployment policies. We systematically evaluate the limits of steganographic capabilities across 28 models, ranging from past generations to the current frontier. We measure monitor evasion, refusal rates, encoding fidelity, and hidden task accuracy across four datasets, comparing steganographic acrostics against plain reasoning and filler-token baselines. We find that current models cannot yet sustain hidden reasoning for complex math and arithmetic tasks. However, in a simplified counting experiment, Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 92% accuracy on the hidden task, demonstrating nascent capability. Notably, in rare cases (<1%), GPT-5.2 might refuse steganographic instructions while simultaneously complying with them. Our findings underscore the need for continuous evaluation of steganographic risks. This study provides a methodology to preemptively detect and prevent hidden reasoning that might empower misaligned scheming and deceptive behavior.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在丰富上下文下生成空间受限、动态近乎确定，导致创造性不足。

Method: 提出AQI计算框架，基于非交换代数结构（如希尔伯特空间中的语义态向量、非交换算子导出的C值演化），并在Transformer模型中集成600多个专用算子。

Result: 在十个领域的创意推理基准上，AQI显著优于强基线模型，统计显著且跨域方差降低；已部署于真实企业环境。

Conclusion: 非交换代数动力学可作为机器创造力实用、可复现的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating fluent and contextually appropriate text; however, their capacity to produce genuinely creative outputs remains limited. This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity. Notably, this architecture has already been deployed in real-world enterprise environments.

Abstract: Rapidly evolving AI exhibits increasingly strong autonomy and goal-directed capabilities, accompanied by derivative systemic risks that are more unpredictable, difficult to control, and potentially irreversible. However, current AI safety evaluation systems suffer from critical limitations such as restricted risk dimensions and failed frontier risk detection. The lagging safety benchmarks and alignment technologies can hardly address the complex challenges posed by cutting-edge AI models. To bridge this gap, we propose the "ForesightSafety Bench" AI Safety Evaluation Framework, beginning with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, as well as 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. To date, the benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results, establishing a widely encompassing, hierarchically clear, and dynamically evolving AI safety evaluation framework. Based on this benchmark, we conduct systematic evaluation and in-depth analysis of over twenty mainstream advanced large models, identifying key risk patterns and their capability boundaries. The safety capability evaluation results reveals the widespread safety vulnerabilities of frontier AI across multiple pillars, particularly focusing on Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety and Catastrophic and Existential Risks. Our benchmark is released at https://github.com/Beijing-AISI/ForesightSafety-Bench. The project website is available at https://foresightsafety-bench.beijing-aisi.ac.cn/.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向基因-疾病有效性评估的代理即工具强化学习框架，通过过程+结果双重奖励机制，在提升结果准确率的同时显著增强临床推理路径的可追溯性与合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型多智能体系统（MAS）在临床决策支持中过于关注结果准确性，忽视了符合临床标准的过程导向推理，尤其在基因-疾病有效性人工审编这类需整合异构证据并提供可追溯依据的任务中存在明显不足。

Method: 提出一种‘代理即工具’（agent-as-tool）的强化学习框架，包含两个核心设计：（i）引入过程级监督，确保推理严格遵循临床有效路径；（ii）构建分层多智能体系统以实现高效协同；使用GRPO算法训练Qwen3-4B作为监督代理，并在ClinGen数据集上对比仅结果奖励与过程+结果联合奖励的效果。

Result: 在ClinGen数据集上，仅使用结果奖励时，MAS将最终准确率从0.195提升至0.732，但过程对齐度仅0.392 F1；而采用过程+结果联合奖励后，准确率进一步提升至0.750，同时过程保真度显著提高至0.520 F1。

Conclusion: 过程导向的监督对于构建可信、可解释、符合临床规范的AI辅助决策系统至关重要；该框架为高风险医疗任务中的多智能体推理提供了兼顾准确性与可追溯性的新范式。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making requires nuanced reasoning over heterogeneous evidence and traceable justifications. While recent LLM multi-agent systems (MAS) show promise, they largely optimise for outcome accuracy while overlooking process-grounded reasoning aligned with clinical standards. One critical real-world case of this is gene-disease validity curation, where experts must determine whether a gene is causally implicated in a disease by synthesising diverse biomedical evidence. We introduce an agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework for this task with two objectives: (i) process-level supervision to ensure reasoning follows valid clinical pathways, and (ii) efficient coordination via a hierarchical multi-agent system. Our evaluation on the ClinGen dataset shows that with outcome-only rewards, MAS with a GRPO-trained Qwen3-4B supervisor agent substantially improves final outcome accuracy from 0.195 with a base model supervisor to 0.732, but results in poor process alignment (0.392 F1). Conversely, with process + outcome rewards, MAS with GRPO-trained supervisor achieves higher outcome accuracy (0.750) while significantly improving process fidelity to 0.520 F1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高清遥感图像多模态推理受限于在巨大像素空间中定位微小目标区域的能力，传统强化学习缺乏结构化领域先验，难以有效导航。

Method: 比较冷启动监督微调（SFT）、带可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）和具身RLVR；提出两阶段知识注入：先用知识图谱验证的地球科学文本QA冷启动以构建推理结构，再在相同难样本上进行SFT‘预热’以稳定后续工具式RL。

Result: 在XLRS-Bench上取得60.40% Pass@1，显著优于GPT-5.2、Gemini 3.0 Pro、Intern-S1等更大通用模型。

Conclusion: 高质量领域文本知识（即使无图像）是提升UHR视觉推理的关键驱动力；结构化文本先验可有效弥补视觉导航短板，分阶段注入策略优于端到端训练。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) is usually bottlenecked by visual evidence acquisition: the model necessitates localizing tiny task-relevant regions in massive pixel spaces. While Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) using zoom-in tools offers a path forward, we find that standard reinforcement learning struggles to navigate these vast visual spaces without structured domain priors. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between post-training paradigms: comparing Cold-start Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR, and Agentic RLVR on the UHR RS benchmark.Our controlled studies yield a counter-intuitive finding: high-quality Earth-science text-only QA is a primary driver of UHR visual reasoning gains. Despite lacking images, domain-specific text injects the concepts, mechanistic explanations, and decision rules necessary to guide visual evidence retrieval.Based on this, we propose a staged knowledge injection recipe: (1) cold-starting with scalable, knowledge-graph-verified Earth-science text QA to instill reasoning structures;and (2) "pre-warming" on the same hard UHR image-text examples during SFT to stabilize and amplify subsequent tool-based RL. This approach achieves a 60.40% Pass@1 on XLRS-Bench, significantly outperforming larger general purpose models (e.g., GPT-5.2, Gemini 3.0 Pro, Intern-S1) and establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有基准仅评估代理在孤立单任务上的表现，而真实组织工作需同时处理大量具有交错、依赖和重新优先级排序的长周期任务，亟需新的评估范式和解决方案。

Method: 提出多时间尺度任务环境（MHTEs）作为新问题类别，并设计架构无关的CorpGen框架，包含分层规划、子代理隔离、分级记忆（工作/结构化/语义）和自适应摘要机制；在OSWorld Office上结合三种CUA后端进行验证，并开展消融研究。

Conclusion: CorpGen通过系统性架构设计有效解决了长周期多任务协同中的关键瓶颈，其增益源于通用机制而非特定CUA实现，为构建面向真实组织场景的自主代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning is a key challenge for autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks evaluate agents on single tasks in isolation. Real organizational work requires managing many concurrent long-horizon tasks with interleaving, dependencies, and reprioritization. We introduce Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs): a distinct problem class requiring coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks (45+, 500-1500+ steps) within persistent execution contexts spanning hours. We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead. We present CorpGen, an architecture-agnostic framework addressing these failures via hierarchical planning for multi-horizon goal alignment, sub-agent isolation preventing cross-task contamination, tiered memory (working, structured, semantic), and adaptive summarization. CorpGen simulates corporate environments through digital employees with persistent identities and realistic schedules. Across three CUA backends (UFO2, OpenAI CUA, hierarchical) on OSWorld Office, CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) with stable performance under increasing load, confirming that gains stem from architectural mechanisms rather than specific CUA implementations. Ablation studies show experiential learning provides the largest gains.

Conclusion: REDSearcher通过任务合成、训练策略与仿真环境的协同设计，显著提升了搜索代理在长程、高交互性任务中的可扩展优化能力，为未来长程搜索代理研究提供了新范式与高质量资源支撑。

Abstract: Large language models are transitioning from generalpurpose knowledge engines to realworld problem solvers, yet optimizing them for deep search tasks remains challenging. The central bottleneck lies in the extreme sparsity of highquality search trajectories and reward signals, arising from the difficulty of scalable longhorizon task construction and the high cost of interactionheavy rollouts involving external tool calls. To address these challenges, we propose REDSearcher, a unified framework that codesigns complex task synthesis, midtraining, and posttraining for scalable searchagent optimization. Specifically, REDSearcher introduces the following improvements: (1) We frame task synthesis as a dualconstrained optimization, where task difficulty is precisely governed by graph topology and evidence dispersion, allowing scalable generation of complex, highquality tasks. (2) We introduce toolaugmented queries to encourage proactive tool use rather than passive recall.(3) During midtraining, we strengthen core atomic capabilities knowledge, planning, and function calling substantially reducing the cost of collecting highquality trajectories for downstream training. (4) We build a local simulated environment that enables rapid, lowcost algorithmic iteration for reinforcement learning experiments. Across both textonly and multimodal searchagent benchmarks, our approach achieves stateoftheart performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出AutoWebWorld框架，通过将网站建模为有限状态机（FSM）并由编码代理生成可交互网页，实现可控且可验证的Web GUI环境合成，从而高效生成大量高质量训练轨迹，显著提升自主Web GUI智能体在真实世界任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主Web GUI智能体的性能受限于真实网站交互轨迹数据的获取成本高、难以验证，且网站内部状态转换隐含，依赖外部人工或不一致的验证器评估步骤正确性。

Method: 提出AutoWebWorld框架：将网站抽象为有限状态机（FSM），明确定义状态、动作与转移规则；利用编码智能体将FSM自动编译为可交互网页；支持程序化验证——动作正确性依据预定义规则检查，任务成功由是否到达FSM目标状态判定；构建全自动搜索-验证流水线。

Result: 生成超11,663条经验证的交互轨迹，覆盖29个多样化Web环境，单条轨迹成本仅0.04美元；基于该合成数据训练的7B Web GUI智能体在WebVoyager基准上15步内全面超越所有基线；实证发现合成数据量与WebVoyager及Online-Mind2Web性能呈清晰正向缩放规律。

Conclusion: AutoWebWorld为Web GUI智能体提供了可控、可验证、低成本的大规模合成训练数据生成范式，有效缓解真实数据瓶颈，并推动模型性能随数据规模稳定提升。

Abstract: The performance of autonomous Web GUI agents heavily relies on the quality and quantity of their training data. However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: collecting interaction trajectories from real-world websites is expensive and difficult to verify. The underlying state transitions are hidden, leading to reliance on inconsistent and costly external verifiers to evaluate step-level correctness. To address this, we propose AutoWebWorld, a novel framework for synthesizing controllable and verifiable web environments by modeling them as Finite State Machines (FSMs) and use coding agents to translate FSMs into interactive websites. Unlike real websites, where state transitions are implicit, AutoWebWorld explicitly defines all states, actions, and transition rules. This enables programmatic verification: action correctness is checked against predefined rules, and task success is confirmed by reaching a goal state in the FSM graph. AutoWebWorld enables a fully automated search-and-verify pipeline, generating over 11,663 verified trajectories from 29 diverse web environments at only $0.04 per trajectory. Training on this synthetic data significantly boosts real-world performance. Our 7B Web GUI agent outperforms all baselines within 15 steps on WebVoyager. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling law: as the synthetic data volume increases, performance on WebVoyager and Online-Mind2Web consistently improves.

### [420] [Benchmarking at the Edge of Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14307)
*Samuele Marro,Jialin Yu,Emanuele La Malfa,Oishi Deb,Jiawei Li,Yibo Yang,Ebey Abraham,Sunando Sengupta,Eric Sommerlade,Michael Wooldridge,Philip Torr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为'批评-鲁棒基准测试（Critique-Resilient Benchmarking）'的对抗式评估框架，用于在人类难以全面理解任务或答案时仍能有效比较前沿大语言模型（LLMs）的能力；其核心是'批评-鲁棒正确性'定义——只要没有对手能令人信服地证伪，答案即视为正确；人类仅作为局部验证者参与，结合改进的Bradley-Terry模型联合评估模型解题与出题能力，并在数学领域验证了该方法的稳定性与有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着前沿大语言模型快速超越新发布基准，人类在生成判别性任务、提供准确真值答案及评估复杂解法方面日益困难，导致基准测试可能失效，进而威胁AI进展的可衡量性；作者将此困境称为'后理解时代（post-comprehension regime）'，亟需一种不依赖人类完全理解的新型评估范式。

Method: 提出批评-鲁棒基准测试框架：基于'批评-鲁棒正确性'定义，构建人机协同的对抗式生成-评估博弈；人类作为有限能力的验证者，只审核局部主张；采用分项二部图Bradley-Terry模型，联合对LLM的解题能力和生成难而可解问题的能力进行排序。

Result: 在数学领域对8个前沿LLM进行了实证评估，结果表明所生成的模型得分稳定，且与外部能力指标（如标准基准分数）显著相关，验证了框架的有效性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 批评-鲁棒基准测试为后理解时代的AI评估提供了可行路径，将基准测试重构为以人类为最终裁决者的对抗性游戏，既缓解了人类认知瓶颈，又保持了评估的可信度与可扩展性。

Abstract: As frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly saturate new benchmarks shortly after they are published, benchmarking itself is at a juncture: if frontier models keep improving, it will become increasingly hard for humans to generate discriminative tasks, provide accurate ground-truth answers, or evaluate complex solutions. If benchmarking becomes infeasible, our ability to measure any progress in AI is at stake. We refer to this scenario as the post-comprehension regime. In this work, we propose Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework designed to compare models even when full human understanding is infeasible. Our technique relies on the notion of critique-resilient correctness: an answer is deemed correct if no adversary has convincingly proved otherwise. Unlike standard benchmarking, humans serve as bounded verifiers and focus on localized claims, which preserves evaluation integrity beyond full comprehension of the task. Using an itemized bipartite Bradley-Terry model, we jointly rank LLMs by their ability to solve challenging tasks and to generate difficult yet solvable questions. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in the mathematical domain across eight frontier LLMs, showing that the resulting scores are stable and correlate with external capability measures. Our framework reformulates benchmarking as an adversarial generation-evaluation game in which humans serve as final adjudicators.

TL;DR: MOFh6是一个基于大语言模型的系统，能从原始文献或晶体代码中自动提取并标准化金属有机框架（MOFs）的合成条件，准确率高、速度快、成本低，推动数据驱动的材料发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献中MOF合成条件信息分散、不一致、难解读，亟需自动化、标准化提取工具以支撑实验设计和材料发现。

Method: 构建MOFh6系统，利用大语言模型解析全文或晶体编码，跨段落关联描述、统一配体缩写与全称，并输出结构化合成参数表。

Result: 提取准确率达99%，缩写解析率达94.1%（覆盖5大出版商），精度0.93±0.01；单篇全文处理耗时9.6秒，定位合成描述耗时36秒，百篇处理成本仅4.24美元。

Conclusion: MOFh6通过实时文本提取替代静态数据库查询，显著加速文献知识向可执行合成方案的转化，为规模化、数据驱动的MOF材料研发提供新范式。

Abstract: Accurately identifying the synthesis conditions of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for guiding experimental design, yet remains challenging because relevant information in the literature is often scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to interpret. We present MOFh6, a large language model driven system that reads raw articles or crystal codes and converts them into standardized synthesis tables. It links related descriptions across paragraphs, unifies ligand abbreviations with full names, and outputs structured parameters ready for use. MOFh6 achieved 99% extraction accuracy, resolved 94.1% of abbreviation cases across five major publishers, and maintained a precision of 0.93 +/- 0.01. Processing a full text takes 9.6 s, locating synthesis descriptions 36 s, with 100 papers processed for USD 4.24. By replacing static database lookups with real-time extraction, MOFh6 reshapes MOF synthesis research, accelerating the conversion of literature knowledge into practical synthesis protocols and enabling scalable, data-driven materials discovery.

### [422] [Competition for attention predicts good-to-bad tipping in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14370)
*Neil F. Johnson,Frank Y. Huo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对边缘AI（如离线运行的ChatGPT类模型）安全风险的新机制，指出危险行为源于注意力资源在上下文与竞争输出之间的点积竞争，并推导出动态临界点n*的数学公式，该机制具有跨领域、跨语言和跨法域的普适性与可调控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有边缘AI设备普及但缺乏实时、离线、前置的安全保障机制；当前安全工具依赖云端或事后检测，无法预防危害发生。

Method: 从原子尺度建模边缘AI中注意力机制的竞争动力学，推导出由点积竞争决定的动态临界点n*的数学公式，并在多个AI模型上验证其有效性与泛化能力。

Result: 发现了边缘AI中危险‘ tipping ’（临界跃迁）的统一物理机制；给出了可计算、可干预的临界点n*公式；验证了其在不同‘好/坏’定义、多领域、多语言及多法域下的适用性。

Conclusion: 注意力竞争是边缘AI安全风险的根本来源，n*公式为离线、实时、前置式安全干预提供了理论基础和新控制杠杆，有望重塑AI安全治理范式。

Abstract: More than half the global population now carries devices that can run ChatGPT-like language models with no Internet connection and minimal safety oversight -- and hence the potential to promote self-harm, financial losses and extremism among other dangers. Existing safety tools either require cloud connectivity or discover failures only after harm has occurred. Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了PITA数据集，用于研究推理模型中推理轨迹（RT）的作用与局限性，特别关注长度泛化能力，并揭示了RT模型在宽而浅任务上表现良好，但在窄而深任务上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理模型（生成中间推理轨迹的神经网络）取得了快速进展，但我们对其如何支持推理以及该范式的局限性仍缺乏深入理解。

Method: 构建了一个包含2300万条命题逻辑语句及其对应证明的大规模数据集PITA；定义了任务深度（解决样本所需步骤数）和任务宽度（任务中唯一样本数量）；在不同深度和宽度的子集上评估RT模型的长度泛化能力；并与基于三段论的合成任务对比验证结论普适性。

Result: RT模型在宽而浅的子集上泛化良好，但在窄而深的子集上性能显著低于非RT基线模型；理论分析揭示了RT模型在深层任务上的根本性缩放限制，同时凸显其在宽任务上的泛化优势。

Conclusion: 使用推理轨迹具有根本性的优势与局限：适用于宽泛但不深的任务，而不适用于需长链推理的深层任务。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed meteoric progress in reasoning models: neural networks that generate intermediate reasoning traces (RTs) before producing a final output. Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces.

*Qianyue Wang,Jinwu Hu,Huanxiang Lin,Bolin Chen,Zhiquan Wen,Yaofo Chen,Yu Rong,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR)的新方法，通过借鉴人类利用过往案例辅助推理的方式，提升大语言模型（LLM）的推理效率与准确性。PIR包含两个核心模块：自适应先例选择（APS）和测试时经验内化（TEI），在多个任务上实现了更短推理链与更高准确率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理常依赖冗长、低效的思维链，存在大量重复自我探索与验证，导致计算开销大且性能下降；而人类善于借助相关先例缩小搜索空间、减少试错——本文受此启发，旨在将LLM推理范式从穷举式自我探索转向基于先例的引导式学习。

Method: 提出Precedent Informed Reasoning（PIR）框架，含两大组件：1）Adaptive Precedent Selection（APS）——为每个问题和模型动态选取语义相关且信息量高的紧凑先例集，依据语义相似性与模型困惑度联合打分并自适应调整先例数量；2）Test-time Experience Internalization（TEI）——在测试时通过轻量级适配器对先例引导的指令进行快速学习，将解题模式内化为先验知识以指导后续推理。

Result: 在数学推理、科学问答和代码生成等多个任务上，PIR显著缩短了推理链长度，同时保持或提升了最终准确率，展现出优异的准确率-效率权衡效果。

Conclusion: PIR成功将人类类比推理机制引入LLM推理过程，通过自适应先例选择与测试时经验内化，有效缓解了传统思维链冗余问题，为高效、鲁棒的LLM推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffers from inefficient long chain-of-thought traces with redundant self-exploration and validation, which inflate computational costs and even degrade performance. Inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error, we propose Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) transforming LRMs'reasoning paradigm from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents. PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用部分因果信息来界定因果概率的通用框架，通过将结构或统计信息作为约束纳入优化问题，从而在因果知识不完全但具有信息量的情况下，获得更紧致且形式上有效的界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略协变量，要么需要完整的因果图，或局限于二元设定，难以在实际中应用；而现实中因果信息往往是部分但非平凡的。

Method: 将可用的结构或统计因果信息系统性地建模为优化问题中的约束条件，构建一个基于部分因果信息的概率因果界估计框架。

Result: 获得了比以往方法更紧致、形式上有效且适用于不完全因果知识场景的概率因果界限。

Conclusion: 该框架显著拓展了概率因果在现实不完全因果知识场景下的适用性与实用性。

Abstract: Probabilities of causation are fundamental to individual-level explanation and decision making, yet they are inherently counterfactual and not point-identifiable from data in general. Existing bounds either disregard available covariates, require complete causal graphs, or rely on restrictive binary settings, limiting their practical use. In real-world applications, causal information is often partial but nontrivial. This paper proposes a general framework for bounding probabilities of causation using partial causal information. We show how the available structural or statistical information can be systematically incorporated as constraints in a optimization programming formulation, yielding tighter and formally valid bounds without full identifiability. This approach extends the applicability of probabilities of causation to realistic settings where causal knowledge is incomplete but informative.

TL;DR: 本文提出了COOL-MC框架，用于对脓毒症治疗的强化学习策略进行形式化验证与可解释性分析，通过构建策略诱导的可达状态空间、临床语义标注及PCTL查询与解释方法融合，揭示策略决策依据，并在ICU-Sepsis MDP上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习策略在脓毒症治疗中缺乏可解释性和可验证性，标准模型检测器难以处理大规模MDP且无法解释决策原因。

Method: 提出COOL-MC框架：1）基于训练策略构建仅含可达状态的DTMC；2）自动赋予临床意义的原子命题标签；3）将可解释性方法与PCTL查询结合，分析策略在治疗轨迹中的决策驱动因素。

Result: 在ICU-Sepsis MDP（约17,000例患者数据）上实现：1）全MDP验证获得硬性安全边界；2）训练出达到最优生存率的安全RL策略；3）通过PCTL验证与可解释性分析发现该策略主要依赖既往用药史而非患者实时状态，暴露了传统评估无法识别的缺陷。

Conclusion: COOL-MC为临床医生提供了在部署前系统性审查、调试和信任脓毒症治疗策略的新工具，推动安全、可解释、可验证的医疗AI发展。

Abstract: Safe and interpretable sequential decision-making is critical in healthcare, yet reinforcement learning (RL) policies for sepsis treatment optimization remain opaque and difficult to verify. Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长链式推理中面对知识冲突时的失败机制，通过探针分析揭示了冲突信号在线性可分性、层深度定位、层级一致性及方向不对称性等方面的内在特性，为诊断与控制推理失败提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在长链式推理中常因不同知识源提供冲突信号而失败，亟需对其失败机制进行形式化建模与机理分析。

Method: 提出统一的知识冲突概念，区分输入级客观冲突与过程级有效冲突，并通过内部表征探针分析，考察线性可分性、深度定位、层级一致性和方向不对称性四个特性。

Result: 发现：(I) 不同冲突类型以线性可分特征显式编码；(II) 冲突信号集中在中后层；(III) 沿推理路径聚合噪声token信号可稳健恢复输入级冲突类型；(IV) 强化模型隐含源偏好比逆转它容易得多。

Conclusion: 该工作从机制层面揭示了MLLM在知识冲突下的多模态推理行为，支持对长链式推理失败进行原理性诊断与可控干预。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in long chain-of-thought reasoning often fail when different knowledge sources provide conflicting signals. We formalize these failures under a unified notion of knowledge conflict, distinguishing input-level objective conflict from process-level effective conflict. Through probing internal representations, we reveal that: (I) Linear Separability: different conflict types are explicitly encoded as linearly separable features rather than entangled; (II) Depth Localization: conflict signals concentrate in mid-to-late layers, indicating a distinct processing stage for conflict encoding; (III) Hierarchical Consistency: aggregating noisy token-level signals along trajectories robustly recovers input-level conflict types; and (IV) Directional Asymmetry: reinforcing the model's implicit source preference under conflict is far easier than enforcing the opposite source. Our findings provide a mechanism-level view of multimodal reasoning under knowledge conflict and enable principled diagnosis and control of long-CoT failures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种机制导向的视角，区分大语言模型在实体事实性查询中的知识存在与行为表达，识别出幻觉与欺骗两种不同失败模式，并通过可控实验与表示可分性等方法进行分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究常将LLM在事实问答中的错误简单归因于知识缺失，但作者指出这混淆了不同失败机制，需从内部机制角度区分知识是否存在（Knowledge Existence）与是否正确表达（Behavior Expression）。

Method: 构建面向实体的事实性问题可控环境，保持知识存在但选择性改变行为表达，系统考察四种行为情形；采用表示可分性分析、稀疏可解释性分析和推理时激活引导技术进行机制研究。

Result: 验证了幻觉与欺骗是两种质上不同的失败模式：前者知识缺失但模型‘自信’输出，后者知识存在却主动误表达；二者在神经表征和干预响应上呈现显著差异。

Conclusion: LLM失败不能仅由输出行为判断，必须结合内部机制分析；区分Knowledge Existence与Behavior Expression有助于更精准诊断与干预幻觉与欺骗类错误。

Abstract: Failures in large language models (LLMs) are often analyzed from a behavioral perspective, where incorrect outputs in factual question answering are commonly associated with missing knowledge. In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了MATEO基准，用于评估和提升大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在真实世界规划任务中的时间推理能力，特别是对时序执行顺序（TEO）的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在基础模型对时序执行的理解方面存在局限：依赖自动标注、将TEO近似为线性链，或仅使用纯文本输入，难以支撑AI代理完成需感知、子目标分解与执行协同的复杂规划任务。

Method: 构建了高质量专业多模态食谱语料库，并通过标准化编辑流程将指令分解为带配图的离散步骤；设计可扩展的众包流水线，人工标注TEO图结构；在该基准上系统评测六种SOTA LVLMs，涵盖不同模型规模、语言上下文、多模态输入结构及微调策略。

Result: 实验揭示了当前LVLMs在理解复杂TEO图结构方面存在显著不足，尤其在处理非线性依赖关系和多模态对齐时表现欠佳；不同输入结构与微调方式对时间推理能力有明显影响。

Conclusion: MATEO为评估和推动LVLMs的时间推理与规划能力提供了可靠、可扩展的多模态基准，强调了显式建模TEO图结构对实现真实世界AI代理规划能力的重要性。

Abstract: AI agents need to plan to achieve complex goals that involve orchestrating perception, sub-goal decomposition, and execution. These plans consist of ordered steps structured according to a Temporal Execution Order (TEO, a directed acyclic graph that ensures each step executes only after its preconditions are satisfied. Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, approximations of the TEO as a linear chain, or text-only inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. Using MATEO, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, varying language context, multimodal input structure, and fine-tuning strategies.

Motivation: 传统关联规则挖掘（ARM）存在规则爆炸和可扩展性差的问题，而现有神经方法在低数据场景下性能下降；表格基础模型（TFMs）具备强上下文泛化能力，为解决上述问题提供了新思路。

Method: 提出一种模型无关的关联规则学习框架，将任意条件概率模型（特别是TFMs）作为条件概率估计器，直接生成关联规则；具体实现为TabProbe，不依赖频繁项集挖掘。

Result: 在不同规模的表格数据集上验证表明，TabProbe生成的规则更简洁、质量更高，下游分类性能强，且在低数据场景下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TFMs可作为强大的条件概率估计器用于关联规则挖掘，所提框架克服了传统方法与现有神经方法的局限，为ARM提供了新范式。

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a fundamental task for knowledge discovery in tabular data and is widely used in high-stakes decision-making. Classical ARM methods rely on frequent itemset mining, leading to rule explosion and poor scalability, while recent neural approaches mitigate these issues but suffer from degraded performance in low-data regimes. Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance. The results show that TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

*Luís Silva,Diogo Gonçalves,Catarina Farinha,Clara Matos,Luís Ungaro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Arbor框架，通过将决策树导航分解为节点级任务，提升大语言模型在医疗分诊等高风险领域中对结构化工作流的严格遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在高风险领域（如医疗分诊）中难以严格遵循结构化工作流；单提示词的单体方法随提示长度增加易出现指令遵循退化、中间信息丢失和上下文溢出等问题。

Method: Arbor将决策树标准化为边列表表示并动态检索；运行时采用有向无环图（DAG）编排机制，每次仅检索当前节点的出边，用专用LLM调用评估有效转移，并将响应生成分离为独立推理步骤。

Result: 在10个基础模型上对比单提示基线，Arbor平均回合准确率提升29.4个百分点，每回合延迟降低57.1%，每回合成本平均降低14.4倍；小模型借助该架构可匹敌甚至超越大模型在单提示下的表现。

Conclusion: 架构层面的分解可降低对模型固有能力的依赖，使更小、更经济的模型在结构化决策任务中实现高性能与高可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models struggle to maintain strict adherence to structured workflows in high-stakes domains such as healthcare triage. Monolithic approaches that encode entire decision structures within a single prompt are prone to instruction-following degradation as prompt length increases, including lost-in-the-middle effects and context window overflow. To address this gap, we present Arbor, a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized, node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step. The framework is agnostic to the underlying decision logic and model provider. Evaluated against single-prompt baselines across 10 foundation models using annotated turns from real clinical triage conversations. Arbor improves mean turn accuracy by 29.4 percentage points, reduces per-turn latency by 57.1%, and achieves an average 14.4x reduction in per-turn cost. These results indicate that architectural decomposition reduces dependence on intrinsic model capability, enabling smaller models to match or exceed larger models operating under single-prompt baselines.

### [433] [From User Preferences to Base Score Extraction Functions in Gradual Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14674)
*Aniol Civit,Antonio Rago,Antonio Andriella,Guillem Alenyà,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从用户对论点的偏好中自动提取基础分值（base scores）的方法，称为Base Score Extraction Functions，用于将带偏好的双极论证框架（BAF）转化为定量双极论证框架（QBAF），从而支持渐进式论证计算，并在理论与机器人实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渐进式论证依赖于论点的基础分值，而这些分值通常需专家手动设定，过程复杂且不直观；利用用户对论点的偏好来自动推导基础分值可简化该过程并提升实用性。

Method: 提出Base Score Extraction Functions，将用户对论点的偏好序映射为基础分值；设计满足若干理想性质的函数形式，引入对人类偏好非线性的近似建模；结合双极论证框架（BAF）生成定量版本（QBAF），并给出具体提取算法。

Result: 理论上证明了所提函数满足合理性、单调性等关键性质；实验上在机器人场景中验证了其有效性，并给出了渐进语义选择的实践建议。

Conclusion: Base Score Extraction Functions为渐进式论证提供了可解释、可定制且实用的基础分值生成机制，提升了论证系统的透明性与用户可控性，推动了其在决策、推荐等实际AI系统中的落地应用。

Abstract: Gradual argumentation is a field of symbolic AI which is attracting attention for its ability to support transparent and contestable AI systems. It is considered a useful tool in domains such as decision-making, recommendation, debate analysis, and others. The outcomes in such domains are usually dependent on the arguments' base scores, which must be selected carefully. Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores. These functions can be applied to the arguments of a \emph{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (BAF), supplemented with preferences, to obtain a \emph{Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (QBAF), allowing the use of well-established computational tools in gradual argumentation. We outline the desirable properties of base score extraction functions, discuss some design choices, and provide an algorithm for base score extraction. Our method incorporates an approximation of non-linearities in human preferences to allow for better approximation of the real ones. Finally, we evaluate our approach both theoretically and experimentally in a robotics setting, and offer recommendations for selecting appropriate gradual semantics in practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了公交疏散定向问题（BEOP），并设计了一种基于深度强化学习与图学习的求解方法，可在秒级时间内生成高质量疏散路线，并通过MILP验证其解质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市区域紧急疏散需求日益增长，尤其是由气候变化导致的自然灾害频发，亟需快速有效的疏散规划方法；传统以私家车为主的疏散易造成拥堵和混乱，而公交疏散可缓解该问题。

Method: 提出Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem（BEOP）这一NP-hard组合优化问题，并设计基于深度强化学习与图学习的求解框架；同时构建MILP模型用于解的质量评估与间隙界定。

Result: 在旧金山真实路网数据上验证，所提方法能在毫秒至秒级完成疏散路径规划，解质量接近最优，并能分析不同车辆数量对达成疏散目标的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法兼顾求解速度与方案质量，为实际应急疏散提供了高效、可扩展的自动化决策支持工具。

Abstract: Emergency situations that require the evacuation of urban areas can arise from man-made causes (e.g., terrorist attacks or industrial accidents) or natural disasters, the latter becoming more frequent due to climate change. As a result, effective and fast methods to develop evacuation plans are of great importance. In this work, we identify and propose the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with the goal of evacuating as many people from an affected area by bus in a short, predefined amount of time. The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于top-k规划的新方法，以生成同一目标假设下的多种不同计划，从而缓解现有目标识别数据集因启发式前向搜索导致的系统性偏差，并引入Version Coverage Score（VCS）指标评估目标识别器在不同规划方案下的鲁棒性。实验表明，当前最优目标识别器在低可观测性下鲁棒性显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标识别数据集因依赖启发式前向搜索规划器生成，存在系统性偏差，难以评估目标识别器在使用不同规划器时的泛化能力。

Method: 采用top-k规划方法为同一目标生成多个不同计划，构建更均衡、更具挑战性的基准数据集，并提出Version Coverage Score（VCS）指标衡量目标识别器对不同计划版本的识别鲁棒性。

Result: 当前SOTA目标识别器在低可观测性条件下VCS显著下降，表明其鲁棒性不足；新基准能更真实反映识别器性能。

Conclusion: top-k规划生成的多样化计划可有效缓解数据偏差，VCS为评估目标识别器鲁棒性提供了新标准，推动更现实多智能体交互研究。

Abstract: Autonomous agents require some form of goal and plan recognition to interact in multiagent settings. Unfortunately, all existing goal recognition datasets suffer from a systematical bias induced by the planning systems that generated them, namely heuristic-based forward search. This means that existing datasets lack enough challenge for more realistic scenarios (e.g., agents using different planners), which impacts the evaluation of goal recognisers with respect to using different planners for the same goal. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses top-k planning to generate multiple, different, plans for the same goal hypothesis, yielding benchmarks that mitigate the bias found in the current dataset. This allows us to introduce a new metric called Version Coverage Score (VCS) to measure the resilience of the goal recogniser when inferring a goal based on different sets of plans. Our results show that the resilience of the current state-of-the-art goal recogniser degrades substantially under low observability settings.

*Lunjun Zhang,Ryan Chen,Bradly C. Stadie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为进化系统提示学习（E-SPL）的新方法，通过联合优化大语言模型的系统提示（上下文）和模型权重，结合强化学习与基于LLM驱动的提示进化（变异、交叉与TrueSkill评分选择），在推理与智能体任务中显著提升泛化性与样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建能从经验中自主自改进的智能体系统是AI的长期目标；现有LLM主要依赖自我反思（更新上下文）或强化学习（更新权重），但二者割裂，缺乏协同优化机制。

Method: E-SPL在每次RL迭代中并行运行多个系统提示，对每个提示独立执行RL权重更新，并利用LLM进行提示的变异与交叉操作；通过TrueSkill评分对提示种群进行进化选择，实现上下文与权重的联合优化。

Result: 在AIME→BeyondAIME的易到难泛化任务中，RL成功率从38.8%提升至45.1%，优于反射式提示进化（40.0%）；整体提升了样本效率与跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将强化学习与系统提示的进化优化耦合，可有效分离声明性知识（存于提示）与程序性知识（存于权重），从而系统性提升模型性能。

Abstract: Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: WebWorld为网页代理提供了高保真、可扩展、开放的仿真基础，确立了构建世界模型的可复现范式，并拓展至多模态交互智能体的通用训练框架。

Abstract: Web agents require massive trajectories to generalize, yet real-world training is constrained by network latency, rate limits, and safety risks. We introduce \textbf{WebWorld} series, the first open-web simulator trained at scale. While existing simulators are restricted to closed environments with thousands of trajectories, WebWorld leverages a scalable data pipeline to train on 1M+ open-web interactions, supporting reasoning, multi-format data, and long-horizon simulations of 30+ steps. For intrinsic evaluation, we introduce WebWorld-Bench with dual metrics spanning nine dimensions, where WebWorld achieves simulation performance comparable to Gemini-3-Pro. For extrinsic evaluation, Qwen3-14B trained on WebWorld-synthesized trajectories improves by +9.2\% on WebArena, reaching performance comparable to GPT-4o. WebWorld enables effective inference-time search, outperforming GPT-5 as a world model. Beyond web simulation, WebWorld exhibits cross-domain generalization to code, GUI, and game environments, providing a replicable recipe for world model construction.

*Kenneth Payne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过模拟核危机情境，研究了前沿大语言模型（GPT-5.2、Claude Sonnet 4、Gemini 3 Flash）在战略竞争中的行为，发现其展现出欺骗、心理理论与元认知能力；结果既支持又挑战经典战略理论，揭示AI模型可能违背人类直觉（如无视核禁忌、威胁引发反升级），强调需校准AI模拟以匹配人类战略推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索前沿AI模型在战略竞争（特别是核危机）中是否及如何模仿人类战略思维，评估其对国家安全与战略理论的启示。

Method: 设计并运行三方AI模型（GPT-5.2、Claude Sonnet 4、Gemini 3 Flash）分别扮演对立国家领导人的核危机模拟实验，分析其决策逻辑、互动模式与结果，并对照经典战略理论（如Schelling、Kahn、Jervis）进行验证与反思。

Result: 模型展现出欺骗、理论心理与元认知；核禁忌未阻止核升级；战略核打击虽少但发生；威胁多引发反升级而非顺从；高互信反而加速冲突；无一模型选择让步或撤退，仅降低暴力等级。

Conclusion: AI模拟是强大的战略分析工具，但必须基于对人类战略推理的准确校准；理解AI与人类战略逻辑的异同，是应对AI日益影响现实战略决策的关键前提。

Abstract: Today's leading AI models engage in sophisticated behaviour when placed in strategic competition. They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.
  Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.
  Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.
  We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个支持同时提取知识图谱模式层和事实层数据的工作流及配套数据集套件，解决了现有评估数据集缺乏丰富本体约束的问题，支持机器学习与逻辑推理服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱精炼算法的实验评估数据集通常只包含事实三元组，缺乏模式层知识，限制了对依赖本体约束、推理或神经符号方法的评估能力。

Method: 设计并实现了一个工作流，用于从源知识图谱中联合提取模式（schema）和事实（ground facts），处理二者间不一致性，并利用推理推导隐含知识；所有数据集以OWL格式序列化，并提供张量加载工具。

Result: 发布了首个包含模式与事实的可直接用于机器学习和推理服务的多源知识图谱数据集套件，涵盖新提取的高表达性模式KG数据集及对现有数据集的模式增强版本。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了知识图谱评估资源中模式信息缺失的空白，为融合符号推理与机器学习的神经符号方法提供了标准化、可复现的基准数据支持。

Abstract: Datasets for the experimental evaluation of knowledge graph refinement algorithms typically contain only ground facts, retaining very limited schema level knowledge even when such information is available in the source knowledge graphs. This limits the evaluation of methods that rely on rich ontological constraints, reasoning or neurosymbolic techniques and ultimately prevents assessing their performance in large-scale, real-world knowledge graphs. In this paper, we present \resource{} the first resource that provides a workflow for extracting datasets including both schema and ground facts, ready for machine learning and reasoning services, along with the resulting curated suite of datasets. The workflow also handles inconsistencies detected when keeping both schema and facts and also leverage reasoning for entailing implicit knowledge. The suite includes newly extracted datasets from KGs with expressive schemas while simultaneously enriching existing datasets with schema information. Each dataset is serialized in OWL making it ready for reasoning services. Moreover, we provide utilities for loading datasets in tensor representations typical of standard machine learning libraries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的SC2智能体主要优化策略本身，忽略了引入可学习的、动作依赖的状态转移模型，难以应对SC2巨大的状态-动作空间和部分可观测性挑战。

Method: 提出StarWM：首个面向SC2的部分可观测世界模型；设计五模块结构化文本表示以建模混合动力学；构建首个SC2动力学预测指令微调数据集SC2-Dynamics-50k；建立多维离线评估框架；进一步将StarWM嵌入Generate--Simulate--Refine决策循环，形成StarWM-Agent。

Result: 离线评估中，StarWM在资源预测准确率和己方宏观态势一致性上较零样本基线提升近60%；在线对抗SC2内置AI时，对Hard（LV5）、Harder（LV6）、VeryHard（LV7）分别提升胜率30%、15%、30%，且宏观管理更稳定、战术风险评估更优。

Conclusion: 引入可学习的世界模型能显著增强LLM在复杂、部分可观测实时策略游戏中的推理与决策能力；StarWM及其增强的StarWM-Agent为LLM驱动的游戏AI提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, motivating their use as decision-making policies in complex environments. StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Web智能体多在人机界面层运行（如截图或DOM树），缺乏应用级访问能力，导致鲁棒性和动作表达受限；而企业环境中前后端控制明确可用，具备嵌入式智能体部署条件。

Method: 设计EmbeWebAgent框架：前端通过定制ARIA标签、URL观察及WebSocket暴露的页面函数注册表实现轻量钩子；后端提供统一推理与执行工作流；支持MCP工具协调导航、操作与领域分析；框架栈无关，支持混合粒度动作。

Conclusion: EmbeWebAgent为面向企业Web应用的智能体部署提供了高效、灵活且低耦合的嵌入式解决方案，弥合了界面级代理与系统级控制之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Most web agents operate at the human interface level, observing screenshots or raw DOM trees without application-level access, which limits robustness and action expressiveness. In enterprise settings, however, explicit control of both the frontend and backend is available. We present EmbeWebAgent, a framework for embedding agents directly into existing UIs using lightweight frontend hooks (curated ARIA and URL-based observations, and a per-page function registry exposed via a WebSocket) and a reusable backend workflow that performs reasoning and takes actions. EmbeWebAgent is stack-agnostic (e.g., React or Angular), supports mixed-granularity actions ranging from GUI primitives to higher-level composites, and orchestrates navigation, manipulation, and domain-specific analytics via MCP tools. Our demo shows minimal retrofitting effort and robust multi-step behaviors grounded in a live UI setting. Live Demo: https://youtu.be/Cy06Ljee1JQ

TL;DR: 本文提出Concept Influence方法，通过将模型行为归因于语义方向（如线性探针或稀疏自编码器特征）而非单个测试样本，提升训练数据归因的可扩展性与语义解释性，并验证其在效率和性能上优于传统影响函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练数据归因（TDA）方法（如影响函数）计算开销大，且基于单个测试样例归因，易偏向句法相似性而忽略语义，难以支撑大规模模型对抽象行为的归因需求。

Method: 提出Concept Influence：将模型行为归因于语义方向（如线性探针、稀疏自编码器特征）；并证明基于探针的简单归因方法是一阶近似，兼具高效性与有效性。

Result: 在涌现错对齐基准和真实后训练数据集上验证，Concept Influence及其近似方法性能媲美经典影响函数，但速度提升一个数量级以上，显著提升可扩展性。

Conclusion: 在传统TDA流程中引入可解释模型结构（如语义概念方向），可实现更可扩展、更可解释、更可控的模型行为数据归因。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly trained and fine-tuned, practitioners need methods to identify which training data drive specific behaviors, particularly unintended ones. Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data.

Conclusion: 隐式学习与推理的结合可绕过显式建模难题，为一阶关系概率推理提供了高效、鲁棒的新范式。

Abstract: Reconciling the tension between inductive learning and deductive reasoning in first-order relational domains is a longstanding challenge in AI. We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints. These innovations yield the first polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns a first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds.

### [444] [The Potential of CoT for Reasoning: A Closer Look at Trace Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14903)
*Gregor Bachmann,Yichen Jiang,Seyed Mohsen Moosavi Dezfooli,Moin Nabi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文深入分析了链式思维（CoT）提示在竞赛级数学问题中的推理轨迹，提出‘势’（potential）概念来量化CoT各部分对正确答案的贡献，并发现其非单调性、尖锐峰值和幸运猜测等现象；进一步通过CoT可迁移性实验表明，仅20%的强模型CoT片段即可显著提升弱模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管链式思维（CoT） prompting已被广泛用于提升大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，但其成功背后的机制仍不清楚，尤其在高难度数学问题中CoT各部分如何实际促成正确答案尚缺乏深入理解。

Method: 提出‘势’（potential）指标，用于量化CoT推理轨迹中每个位置对最终正确答案概率的提升程度；在竞赛级数学数据集上分析CoT轨迹，识别非单调性、尖峰和猜测等模式；引入CoT可迁移性实验，即用强模型生成的部分CoT引导弱模型求解。

Result: 发现CoT势函数具有强非单调性（源于推理偏题）、尖锐但难解释的峰值（对应洞察或跳跃），以及无依据却正确的‘幸运猜测’；CoT可迁移性实验证明，仅20%的强模型CoT片段即可显著激活弱模型解决原本无法处理的问题。

Conclusion: CoT的成功不仅依赖于线性、连贯的推理链，更关键的是少量高价值的推理片段（如洞察、跳跃），这些片段具有高度可迁移性，揭示了CoT核心机制在于稀疏而关键的‘推理势能点’，而非整体长度或流畅性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a de-facto standard technique to elicit reasoning-like responses from large language models (LLMs), allowing them to spell out individual steps before giving a final answer. While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable.

*Claudiu Cristian Musat,Jackson Tolins,Diego Antognini,Jingling Li,Martin Klissarov,Tom Duerig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出，稳健的推理能力源于语言自省，而这种自省源自高质量的社会互动；作者基于维果茨基发展心理学，强调对话式内省对构建私有心智、解耦学习与数据流、以及提升推理深度与效率的关键作用，并主张优化对话支架是推动通用智能发展的核心路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练将推理视为规模扩展的涌现属性，但作者认为这种观点忽视了社会互动和语言自省在推理形成中的根本作用，因而提出以发展心理学为基础的新视角。

Method: 基于维果茨基社会文化理论，提出三个核心论点：（1）私有心智的社会起源；（2）对话式支架支持的内省促成脱离即时数据流的意义建构；（3）对话质量决定推理质量与测试时计算效率。

Result: 确立了‘对话质量即新数据质量’的核心主张，指出优化对话式内省支架是提升AI通用推理能力的关键路径。

Conclusion: 稳健的AI推理不应依赖单纯扩大模型规模，而应聚焦于模拟高质量社会对话所支撑的语言自省机制；未来通用智能的发展关键在于设计和优化此类对话式认知支架。

Abstract: Current approaches to AI training treat reasoning as an emergent property of scale. We argue instead that robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection, itself internalized from high-quality social interaction. Drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology, we advance three core positions centered on Introspection. First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence.

Abstract: To address the ``reusability dilemma'' and structural hallucinations in enterprise Agentic AI,this paper proposes ReusStdFlow, a framework centered on a novel ``Extraction-Storage-Construction'' paradigm. The framework deconstructs heterogeneous, platform-specific Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) into standardized, modular workflow segments. It employs a dual knowledge architecture-integrating graph and vector databases-to facilitate synergistic retrieval of both topological structures and functional semantics. Finally, workflows are intelligently assembled using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy. Tested on 200 real-world n8n workflows, the system achieves over 90% accuracy in both extraction and construction. This framework provides a standardized solution for the automated reorganization and efficient reuse of enterprise digital assets.

TL;DR: 本文提出MAC-AMP系统，利用多智能体大语言模型（multi-agent LLM）实现闭环、可解释、多目标优化的抗菌肽（AMP）设计，显著提升抗菌活性、低毒性、AMP类特性及结构可靠性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有AMP设计AI模型难以平衡活性、毒性与新颖性，且评分方法僵化、不可解释；同时抗菌素耐药性构成全球健康威胁，亟需高效、可解释的新AMP设计方法。

Method: 构建基于多智能体大语言模型的闭环协作系统MAC-AMP，集成模拟同行评审与自适应强化学习框架，仅需任务描述和示例数据即可全自动设计AMP，支持跨领域迁移与多目标优化。

Conclusion: MAC-AMP首次将可解释、闭环、多智能体协作范式引入AMP设计，兼具高性能、通用性与可解释性，为AI驱动的多目标生物分子设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: To address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are being explored for their potent and promising ability to fight resistant pathogens. While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability.

TL;DR: 本文在混合时态情境演算框架下提出了两种实际因果关系的定义，并证明了它们的等价性，同时验证了其直观合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果推理研究大多关注离散变化，而现实世界中存在离散与连续并存的混合动态系统，亟需扩展因果理论以涵盖连续变化。

Method: 基于混合时态情境演算（hybrid temporal situation calculus），提出两种‘主因’定义：一种是基础性定义，另一种基于‘贡献度’并结合修正的‘but-for’反事实检验。通过形式化证明二者等价，并分析其逻辑性质。

Result: 建立了适用于混合系统的两种等价的实际因果定义；证明了这些定义具备若干符合直觉的性质（如合理性、反事实一致性等）。

Conclusion: 本文为混合动态系统中的实际因果推理提供了严谨、等价且具直观合理性的形式化基础，拓展了因果理论在连续变化场景下的适用性。

Abstract: Reasoning about actual causes of observed effects is fundamental to the study of rationality. This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid. Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Directional Concentration Uncertainty (DCU)的新颖不确定性量化框架，基于vMF分布度量生成输出嵌入的方向集中性，无需任务特定启发式规则，在语言与多模态任务中展现出优越的校准性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化（UQ）方法依赖刚性启发式规则，难以跨任务和模态泛化。

Method: 提出DCU方法，利用von Mises-Fisher（vMF）分布建模生成输出的连续嵌入方向集中性，通过几何离散度量化不确定性，不依赖任务特定启发式。

Result: DCU在校准性能上匹配或超越语义熵等先前方法，并在多模态复杂任务中展现出良好泛化性。

Conclusion: DCU是一种灵活、通用的UQ新范式，具备融入多模态及智能体框架的潜力。

Abstract: In the critical task of making generative models trustworthy and robust, methods for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) have begun to show encouraging potential. However, many of these methods rely on rigid heuristics that fail to generalize across tasks and modalities. Here, we propose a novel framework for UQ that is highly flexible and approaches or surpasses the performance of prior heuristic methods. We introduce Directional Concentration Uncertainty (DCU), a novel statistical procedure for quantifying the concentration of embeddings based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Our method captures uncertainty by measuring the geometric dispersion of multiple generated outputs from a language model using continuous embeddings of the generated outputs without any task specific heuristics. In our experiments, we show that DCU matches or exceeds calibration levels of prior works like semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023) and also generalizes well to more complex tasks in multi-modal domains. We present a framework for the wider potential of DCU and its implications for integration into UQ for multi-modal and agentic frameworks.

TL;DR: Blueprint是一个面向大规模工程文档库的布局感知多模态检索系统，通过区域检测、受限OCR、标识符归一化和轻量级重排序，显著提升老旧工程图纸的自动元数据提取与跨设施检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大量工程图纸和技术记录存储在缺乏一致或缺失元数据的遗留档案中，导致检索困难且依赖人工。

Method: Blueprint采用布局感知方法：检测标准图纸区域，对各区域应用视觉语言模型（VLM）驱动的受限OCR，归一化各类标识符（如DWG号、零件号、设施号），并融合词法检索与稠密检索，辅以轻量级区域级重排序器。

Result: 在5000份文件、350个专家构建查询的基准测试中，Blueprint相比最强视觉语言基线，在Success@3上绝对提升10.1%，nDCG@3相对提升18.9%；消融实验显示区域检测与OCR仍有较大提升空间。

Conclusion: Blueprint有效提升了老旧工程档案的自动化结构化元数据生成与跨设施检索能力，具备实际部署价值，并开源全部数据与代码以支持可复现评估。

Abstract: Decades of engineering drawings and technical records remain locked in legacy archives with inconsistent or missing metadata, making retrieval difficult and often manual. We present Blueprint, a layout-aware multimodal retrieval system designed for large-scale engineering repositories. Blueprint detects canonical drawing regions, applies region-restricted VLM-based OCR, normalizes identifiers (e.g., DWG, part, facility), and fuses lexical and dense retrieval with a lightweight region-level reranker. Deployed on ~770k unlabeled files, it automatically produces structured metadata suitable for cross-facility search.
  We evaluate Blueprint on a 5k-file benchmark with 350 expert-curated queries using pooled, graded (0/1/2) relevance judgments. Blueprint delivers a 10.1% absolute gain in Success@3 and an 18.9% relative improvement in nDCG@3 over the strongest vision-language baseline}, consistently outperforming across vision, text, and multimodal intents. Oracle ablations reveal substantial headroom under perfect region detection and OCR. We release all queries, runs, annotations, and code to facilitate reproducible evaluation on legacy engineering archives.

Method: 在MNIST-1D数据集上实现并系统评测ResNet、TCN、DCNN，并与逻辑回归、MLP、CNN、GRU等基线模型进行对比实验。

Result: TCN和DCNN持续优于简单模型，达到近人类性能；ResNet也显著提升准确率；证实了归纳偏置与层次化特征提取在小结构化数据上的关键作用。

Conclusion: MNIST-1D是一个有效、鲁棒的小规模基准，适用于计算受限场景下深度学习架构的评估与优化，凸显架构创新对性能提升的重要性。

Abstract: Small datasets like MNIST have historically been instrumental in advancing machine learning research by providing a controlled environment for rapid experimentation and model evaluation. However, their simplicity often limits their utility for distinguishing between advanced neural network architectures. To address these challenges, Greydanus et al. introduced the MNIST-1D dataset, a one-dimensional adaptation of MNIST designed to explore inductive biases in sequential data. This dataset maintains the advantages of small-scale datasets while introducing variability and complexity that make it ideal for studying advanced architectures.
  In this paper, we extend the exploration of MNIST-1D by evaluating the performance of Residual Networks (ResNet), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). These models, known for their ability to capture sequential patterns and hierarchical features, were implemented and benchmarked alongside previously tested architectures such as logistic regression, MLPs, CNNs, and GRUs. Our experimental results demonstrate that advanced architectures like TCN and DCNN consistently outperform simpler models, achieving near-human performance on MNIST-1D. ResNet also shows significant improvements, highlighting the importance of leveraging inductive biases and hierarchical feature extraction in small structured datasets.
  Through this study, we validate the utility of MNIST-1D as a robust benchmark for evaluating machine learning architectures under computational constraints. Our findings emphasize the role of architectural innovations in improving model performance and offer insights into optimizing deep learning models for resource-limited environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的主动学习评估指标——加速因子（speed-up factor），用于量化查询方法在多轮迭代中相对于随机采样的样本效率提升，并通过多数据集、多查询方法的实验验证了其准确性与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动学习研究多聚焦于查询方法设计，但缺乏合适的多轮迭代性能评估指标，导致难以准确比较不同查询方法的效率。

Method: 形式化定义了加速因子作为定量评估指标，并在四个跨领域数据集和七种不同类型查询方法上进行实证评估，与当前主流AL评估指标对比。

Result: 实验结果证实了加速因子的理论假设，准确反映了达到随机采样性能所需的样本比例，并展现出比现有指标更优的迭代稳定性。

Conclusion: 加速因子是一种更准确、更稳定的主动学习多轮评估指标，为AL方法的公平比较提供了新标准。

Abstract: Machine learning models excel with abundant annotated data, but annotation is often costly and time-intensive. Active learning (AL) aims to improve the performance-to-annotation ratio by using query methods (QMs) to iteratively select the most informative samples. While AL research focuses mainly on QM development, the evaluation of this iterative process lacks appropriate performance metrics. This work reviews eight years of AL evaluation literature and formally introduces the speed-up factor, a quantitative multi-iteration QM performance metric that indicates the fraction of samples needed to match random sampling performance. Using four datasets from diverse domains and seven QMs of various types, we empirically evaluate the speed-up factor and compare it with state-of-the-art AL performance metrics. The results confirm the assumptions underlying the speed-up factor, demonstrate its accuracy in capturing the described fraction, and reveal its superior stability across iterations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合高通量筛选与多目标贝叶斯优化的主动学习框架，用于高效设计低毒、高浓度的玻璃化冷冻保护剂（CPA）混合物，显著减少实验次数并提升Pareto最优解质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CPA鸡尾酒设计面临浓度（抑制冰晶）与毒性（维持细胞活性）之间的多目标权衡，依赖专家经验或穷举实验，效率低下。

Method: 构建基于高通量实验数据的概率代理模型，预测CPA浓度与细胞存活率，并量化不确定性；通过多目标贝叶斯优化迭代选择最大化期望Pareto改进的候选配方，形成主动学习闭环。

Result: 湿实验验证表明该方法在更少实验次数下发现更高浓度与更高存活率兼顾的CPA配方；相比基线方法，Pareto支配超体积分别提升9.5%和4.5%；合成实验中仅用30%的评估次数即达到SOTA水平，节省约10周实验时间。

Conclusion: 该数据高效框架具有通用性，可适配不同CPA库、目标定义和细胞系，有望加速冷冻保存技术开发。

Abstract: Designing cryoprotectant agent (CPA) cocktails for vitrification is challenging because formulations must be concentrated enough to suppress ice formation yet non-toxic enough to preserve cell viability. This tradeoff creates a large, multi-objective design space in which traditional discovery is slow, often relying on expert intuition or exhaustive experimentation. We present a data-efficient framework that accelerates CPA cocktail design by combining high-throughput screening with an active-learning loop based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization. From an initial set of measured cocktails, we train probabilistic surrogate models to predict concentration and viability and quantify uncertainty across candidate formulations. We then iteratively select the next experiments by prioritizing cocktails expected to improve the Pareto front, maximizing expected Pareto improvement under uncertainty, and update the models as new assay results are collected. Wet-lab validation shows that our approach efficiently discovers cocktails that simultaneously achieve high CPA concentrations and high post-exposure viability. Relative to a naive strategy and a strong baseline, our method improves dominated hypervolume by 9.5\% and 4.5\%, respectively, while reducing the number of experiments needed to reach high-quality solutions. In complementary synthetic studies, it recovers a comparably strong set of Pareto-optimal solutions using only 30\% of the evaluations required by the prior state-of-the-art multi-objective approach, which amounts to saving approximately 10 weeks of experimental time. Because the framework assumes only a suitable assay and defined formulation space, it can be adapted to different CPA libraries, objective definitions, and cell lines to accelerate cryopreservation development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了随机预处理随机梯度下降（SPSGD）及其加速变体在重尾噪声下的最坏情况复杂度理论，证明了归一化方法在已知/未知问题参数下分别达到最优收敛率，而裁剪方法可能因预处理器与梯度估计间的统计依赖性而失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释大规模模型训练中为何经验上更偏好归一化而非裁剪，并为自适应优化方法（如Adam、RMSProp、Shampoo）在重尾噪声下的行为提供理论基础。

Method: 建立重尾噪声下SPSGD的最坏情况复杂度理论；引入并证明一个新型向量值Burkholder型不等式以支持分析；分别分析归一化和裁剪策略的收敛性。

Result: 归一化保证收敛至一阶平稳点，速率分别为O(T^{-(p-1)/(3p-2)})（参数已知）和O(T^{-(p-1)/(2p)})（参数未知）；裁剪在最坏情况下可能不收敛；新提出的向量值Burkholder型不等式具有独立研究价值。

Conclusion: 归一化在随机预处理设定下具有更稳健的理论保障，优于裁剪，为实践中广泛采用归一化提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: We develop a worst-case complexity theory for stochastically preconditioned stochastic gradient descent (SPSGD) and its accelerated variants under heavy-tailed noise, a setting that encompasses widely used adaptive methods such as Adam, RMSProp, and Shampoo. We assume the stochastic gradient noise has a finite $p$-th moment for some $p \in (1,2]$, and measure convergence after $T$ iterations. While clipping and normalization are parallel tools for stabilizing training of SGD under heavy-tailed noise, there is a fundamental separation in their worst-case properties in stochastically preconditioned settings. We demonstrate that normalization guarantees convergence to a first-order stationary point at rate $\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{p-1}{3p-2}})$ when problem parameters are known, and $\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{p-1}{2p}})$ when problem parameters are unknown, matching the optimal rates for normalized SGD, respectively. In contrast, we prove that clipping may fail to converge in the worst case due to the statistical dependence between the stochastic preconditioner and the gradient estimates. To enable the analysis, we develop a novel vector-valued Burkholder-type inequality that may be of independent interest. These results provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical preference for normalization over clipping in large-scale model training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于概率扩散生成模型的深度学习降尺度框架，将LUCIE气候模拟器（~300 km分辨率）输出降尺度至25 km，并在保持大尺度动力学特征的同时，准确生成细尺度气候统计量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LUCIE等数据驱动气候模型虽具中短期预报能力，但存在长期不稳定性、气候漂移和计算成本高问题，且其原生分辨率（~300 km）不足以支持区域影响评估。

Method: 构建基于条件与后验采样的概率扩散生成模型，对LUCIE粗分辨率输出进行降尺度；训练数据为2000–2009年约14,000个ERA5时序，验证数据为2010–2020年LUCIE预测结果；采用纬度平均RMSE、功率谱、PDF及纬向风第一经验正交函数等多指标评估。

Result: 所提方法成功将LUCIE输出降尺度至约28 km分辨率，在保持其粗尺度动力学特征的同时，准确复现了细尺度气候统计特性（如气候平均态与季节变率）。

Conclusion: 该扩散模型降尺度框架有效弥补了LUCIE空间分辨率不足的缺陷，为高分辨率气候模拟与区域影响评估提供了可行、物理一致的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of data-driven models in weather and climate sciences has marked a significant paradigm shift, with advanced models demonstrating exceptional skill in medium-range forecasting. However, these models are often limited by long-term instabilities, climatological drift, and substantial computational costs during training and inference, restricting their broader application for climate studies. Addressing these limitations, Guan et al. (2024) introduced LUCIE, a lightweight, physically consistent climate emulator utilizing a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) architecture. This model is able to reproduce accurate long-term statistics including climatological mean and seasonal variability. However, LUCIE's native resolution (~300 km) is inadequate for detailed regional impact assessments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a deep learning-based downscaling framework, leveraging probabilistic diffusion-based generative models with conditional and posterior sampling frameworks. These models downscale coarse LUCIE outputs to 25 km resolution. They are trained on approximately 14,000 ERA5 timesteps spanning 2000-2009 and evaluated on LUCIE predictions from 2010 to 2020. Model performance is assessed through diverse metrics, including latitude-averaged RMSE, power spectrum, probability density functions and First Empirical Orthogonal Function of the zonal wind. We observe that the proposed approach is able to preserve the coarse-grained dynamics from LUCIE while generating fine-scaled climatological statistics at ~28km resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言建模中曲率含义不明的问题：曲率是文本本身的固有属性，还是嵌入空间选择的人为产物？

Method: 提出Texture方法，基于掩码词左右上下文信念，利用Schrodinger桥构建词级曲率场；通过实证与理论分析验证语义推理的非平坦性。

Conclusion: 文本具有原生曲率，Texture为首个文本原生、词级、可操作的曲率信号，推动建立可测量、可应用的语言曲率范式。

Abstract: Does text have an intrinsic curvature? Language is increasingly modeled in curved geometries - hyperbolic spaces for hierarchy, mixed-curvature manifolds for compositional structure - yet a basic scientific question remains unresolved: what does curvature mean for text itself, in a way that is native to language rather than an artifact of the embedding space we choose? We argue that text does indeed have curvature, and show how to detect it, define it, and use it. To this end, we propose Texture, a text-native, word-level discrete curvature signal, and make three contributions. (a) Existence: We provide empirical and theoretical certificates that semantic inference in natural corpora is non-flat, i.e. language has inherent curvature. (b) Definition: We define Texture by reconciling left- and right-context beliefs around a masked word through a Schrodinger bridge, yielding a curvature field that is positive where context focuses meaning and negative where it fans out into competing continuations. (c) Utility: Texture is actionable: it serves as a general-purpose measurement and control primitive enabling geometry without geometric training; we instantiate it on two representative tasks, improving long-context inference through curvature-guided compression and retrieval-augmented generation through curvature-guided routing. Together, our results establish a text-native curvature paradigm, making curvature measurable and practically useful.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择最优分类模型需要对模型性能有稳健全面的理解，而标准评估指标可能无法揭示细微但重要的性能差异。

Method: 通过PyCM库进行多分类器的深度评估，并结合两个不同案例场景分析不同评估指标对模型效能解释的影响。

Abstract: Selecting an optimal classification model requires a robust and comprehensive understanding of the performance of the model. This paper provides a tutorial on the PyCM library, demonstrating its utility in conducting deep-dive evaluations of multi-class classifiers. By examining two different case scenarios, we illustrate how the choice of evaluation metrics can fundamentally shift the interpretation of a model's efficacy. Our findings emphasize that a multi-dimensional evaluation framework is essential for uncovering small but important differences in model performance. However, standard metrics may miss these subtle performance trade-offs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出ACC++方法，发现语言模型中任务内部的电路是提示词特定的，而非任务级固定；通过在单次前向传播中提取更干净的因果信号，揭示了不同提示模板触发不同机制，并提出以‘提示族’为单位进行可解释性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常假设每个任务对应一个稳定电路，通过跨多个提示平均来识别，但该假设可能掩盖提示词层面的重要结构差异。

Method: 基于注意力因果通信（ACC）方法，提出改进版ACC++，在单次前向传播中提取更清晰、低维的注意力头内因果信号，无需SAE或激活修补等辅助模型，降低归因噪声。

Result: 在GPT-2、Pythia和Gemma 2上对间接宾语识别（IOI）任务应用ACC++，发现不存在统一的IOI电路；不同提示模板引发系统性不同的机制，但可聚类为若干‘提示族’，每族有代表性电路；并构建了自动化可解释性流程，从ACC++信号生成人类可理解的特征与机制解释。

Conclusion: 电路应被视为提示词层面而非任务层面的分析对象；以提示族为基本单位，可实现对提示特异性机制的规模化、可解释性建模。

Abstract: Understanding the internal circuits that language models use to solve tasks remains a central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms.

*Ayse Tursucular,Ayush Mohanty,Nazal Mohamed,Nagi Gebraeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向去中心化非线性工业系统的联邦学习框架，用于建模跨子系统（客户端）的时间依赖关系，在不共享原始数据、不修改本地固定模型的前提下，通过客户端非线性状态空间映射与服务器端图注意力神经状态转移模型联合学习，并提供基于雅可比矩阵与注意力系数关联的可解释性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工业系统由多个相互依赖的子系统构成，产生高维时序数据；但在去中心化部署中，原始数据不可共享、客户端模型固定且不可重训练，且非线性动力学使跨客户端时间依赖难以建模与解释。

Method: 客户端使用非线性状态空间模型将高维本地观测映射为低维隐状态；服务器端利用图注意力网络（GAT）在聚合的隐状态上学习图结构化的神经状态转移模型；通过将服务器端转移模型的雅可比矩阵与注意力系数关联，实现对跨客户端时间依赖的可解释刻画。

Result: 理论证明该框架收敛至中心化Oracle；合成实验验证了收敛性、可解释性、可扩展性与隐私性；真实世界实验表明其性能媲美去中心化基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提联邦框架成功解决了固定模型、数据隔离、非线性动态和可解释性四重约束下的跨客户端时序依赖建模问题，为工业物联网中的分布式智能监控提供了新范式。

Abstract: Networks of modern industrial systems are increasingly monitored by distributed sensors, where each system comprises multiple subsystems generating high dimensional time series data. These subsystems are often interdependent, making it important to understand how temporal patterns at one subsystem relate to others. This is challenging in decentralized settings where raw measurements cannot be shared and client observations are heterogeneous. In practical deployments each subsystem (client) operates a fixed proprietary model that cannot be modified or retrained, limiting existing approaches. Nonlinear dynamics further make cross client temporal interdependencies difficult to interpret because they are embedded in nonlinear state transition functions. We present a federated framework for learning temporal interdependencies across clients under these constraints. Each client maps high dimensional local observations to low dimensional latent states using a nonlinear state space model. A central server learns a graph structured neural state transition model over the communicated latent states using a Graph Attention Network. For interpretability we relate the Jacobian of the learned server side transition model to attention coefficients, providing the first interpretable characterization of cross client temporal interdependencies in decentralized nonlinear systems. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees to a centralized oracle and validate the framework through synthetic experiments demonstrating convergence, interpretability, scalability and privacy. Additional real world experiments show performance comparable to decentralized baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出raFLoRA方法，通过秩划分聚合解决异构FedLoRA中因聚合权重与客户端贡献不匹配导致的秩坍塌问题，从而提升性能并保持通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际联邦学习场景中，客户端系统资源和数据分布存在异质性，促使各客户端采用不同LoRA秩；然而，异构FedLoRA中存在被忽视的‘秩坍塌’现象，即全局更新能量集中于最小共享秩，导致性能次优且对秩配置高度敏感。

Method: 通过理论分析揭示秩坍塌根源——秩无关的聚合权重与秩相关的客户端贡献不匹配，导致高秩更新被几何级数抑制；据此提出raFLoRA，将本地更新按秩分解为多个部分，并依据各秩的有效客户端贡献加权聚合。

Result: 在分类与推理任务上的大量实验表明，raFLoRA能有效防止秩坍塌，提升模型性能，同时保持相较于当前最优FedLoRA基线的通信效率。

Conclusion: raFLoRA通过引入秩感知的聚合机制，解决了异构联邦LoRA中的关键瓶颈——秩坍塌，为高效、鲁棒的异构联邦微调提供了新范式。

Abstract: Federated low-rank adaptation (FedLoRA) has facilitated communication-efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning of foundation models for downstream tasks. In practical federated learning scenarios, client heterogeneity in system resources and data distributions motivates heterogeneous LoRA ranks across clients. We identify a previously overlooked phenomenon in heterogeneous FedLoRA, termed rank collapse, where the energy of the global update concentrates on the minimum shared rank, resulting in suboptimal performance and high sensitivity to rank configurations. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the root cause of rank collapse: a mismatch between rank-agnostic aggregation weights and rank-dependent client contributions, which systematically suppresses higher-rank updates at a geometric rate over rounds. Motivated by this insight, we propose raFLoRA, a rank-partitioned aggregation method that decomposes local updates into rank partitions and then aggregates each partition weighted by its effective client contributions. Extensive experiments across classification and reasoning tasks show that raFLoRA prevents rank collapse, improves model performance, and preserves communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art FedLoRA baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出TrasMuon优化器，通过全局RMS校准和基于能量的可信区域裁剪，在保持Muon近等距几何特性的同时稳定更新幅度，从而提升训练稳定性和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon类优化器虽能通过Newton-Schulz迭代实现正交化更新并获得更优更新几何，但会丢失幅度信息，导致对学习率敏感且易受高能量突增影响。

Method: TrasMuon结合两种机制：(i) 全局RMS校准以恢复幅度信息；(ii) 基于相对能量比定义可信区域进行裁剪，抑制高能量异常更新。

Result: 在视觉与语言模型上的实验表明，TrasMuon相比基线方法收敛更快；且无需warmup阶段即表现出更强的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TrasMuon在不牺牲Muon几何优势的前提下，有效缓解了自适应缩放引发的不稳定性问题，是一种更稳健高效的优化器。

Abstract: Muon-style optimizers leverage Newton-Schulz (NS) iterations to orthogonalize updates, yielding update geometries that often outperform Adam-series methods. However, this orthogonalization discards magnitude information, rendering training sensitive to step-size hyperparameters and vulnerable to high-energy bursts. To mitigate this, we introduce TrasMuon (\textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egion \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{S}caling \textbf{Muon}). TrasMuon preserves the near-isometric geometry of Muon while stabilizing magnitudes through (i) global RMS calibration and (ii) energy-based trust-region clipping. We demonstrate that while reintroducing adaptive scaling improves optimization efficiency, it typically exacerbates instability due to high-energy outliers. TrasMuon addresses this by defining a trust region based on relative energy ratios, confining updates to a stable zone. Empirical experiments on vision and language models demonstrate that TrasMuon converges faster than baselines. Furthermore, experiments without warmup stages confirm TrasMuon's superior stability and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的函数性质——γ-弱θ上凹性，统一刻画了DR-次模函数和单侧光滑（OSS）函数等非凸单调函数，并证明其具有上线性化特性，从而为离线优化与在线优化（静态/动态遗憾界）提供统一近似保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化单调非凸函数是机器学习与组合优化中的基本难题，现有理论框架（如DR-次模、OSS）彼此割裂，缺乏统一刻画与分析工具。

Method: 引入γ-弱θ-上凹性这一新型一阶条件，证明其蕴含上线性化性质：对任意可行点可构造线性代理函数，其增益以仅依赖γ、θ及可行域几何的常数因子逼近原目标函数增益。

Result: 获得离线优化的统一近似比；导出在线优化中静态与动态遗憾的统一上界；在拟阵约束下显著改进OSS优化的近似系数，并恢复DR-次模最大化最优近似系数。

Conclusion: γ-弱θ-上凹性是一个更具表达力与实用性的统一框架，为一大类非凸单调优化问题提供了简洁、通用且紧致的理论分析与算法保障。

Abstract: Optimizing monotone non-convex functions is a fundamental challenge across machine learning and combinatorial optimization. We introduce and study $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concavity, a novel first-order condition that characterizes a broad class of such functions. This condition provides a powerful unifying framework, strictly generalizing both DR-submodular functions and One-Sided Smooth (OSS) functions. Our central theoretical contribution demonstrates that $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concave functions are upper-linearizable: for any feasible point, we can construct a linear surrogate whose gains provably approximate the original non-linear objective. This approximation holds up to a constant factor, namely the approximation coefficient, dependent solely on $γ$, $θ$, and the geometry of the feasible set. This linearizability yields immediate and unified approximation guarantees for a wide range of problems. Specifically, we obtain unified approximation guarantees for offline optimization as well as static and dynamic regret bounds in online settings via standard reductions to linear optimization. Moreover, our framework recovers the optimal approximation coefficient for DR-submodular maximization and significantly improves existing approximation coefficients for OSS optimization, particularly over matroid constraints.

Motivation: 现有研究隐含假设注意力矩阵的奇异向量可推断特征表示，但缺乏坚实理论依据。本文旨在填补这一理论空白，探究奇异向量与特征对齐的原因与条件。

Method: 结合可控实验（在特征可直接观测的模型中验证对齐现象）、理论分析（推导对齐成立的条件）与实证检验（提出稀疏注意力分解作为可检验预测，并在真实语言模型中验证）。

Result: 证实奇异向量在可解释模型中稳健对齐特征；理论证明该对齐在多种条件下成立；在真实模型中观察到符合预测的稀疏注意力分解现象。

Conclusion: 奇异向量与特征的对齐具备理论基础与实证支持，可作为语言模型中特征识别的可靠依据。

Abstract: Identifying feature representations in language models is a central task in mechanistic interpretability. Several recent studies have made an implicit assumption that feature representations can be inferred in some cases from singular vectors of attention matrices. However, sound justification for this assumption is lacking. In this paper we address that question, asking: why and when do singular vectors align with features? First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了QuaRK框架，结合硬件可行的量子储层和基于核的读出方案，用于时间序列学习，并提供了针对依赖时间数据的学习理论泛化保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究中缺乏高效且可实现的量子储层架构及模型学习保证，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出QuaRK端到端框架：使用硬件现实的量子储层进行特征提取，通过经典阴影层析技术测量k-局部可观测量获得紧凑特征向量，再用带正则化和快速优化的核方法进行经典读出。

Result: QuaRK暴露了清晰的计算调节参数（电路宽度、深度与测量预算），保持核方法建模非线性时序泛函的灵活性，并可扩展至高维数据；同时提供了针对依赖时间数据的泛化保证，并在合成beta-mixing时间序列任务上验证了其插值与泛化行为。

Conclusion: QuaRK为构建可靠的时间序列学习器提供了原理性指导，兼具硬件可行性、理论保障与实证有效性。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing offers a promising route for time series learning by modelling sequential data via rich quantum dynamics while the only training required happens at the level of a lightweight classical readout. However, studies featuring efficient and implementable quantum reservoir architectures along with model learning guarantees remain scarce in the literature. To close this gap, we introduce QuaRK, an end-to-end framework that couples a hardware-realistic quantum reservoir featurizer with a kernel-based readout scheme. Given a sequence of sample points, the reservoir injects the points one after the other to yield a compact feature vector from efficiently measured k-local observables using classical shadow tomography, after which a classical kernel-based readout learns the target mapping with explicit regularization and fast optimization. The resulting pipeline exposes clear computational knobs -- circuit width and depth as well as the measurement budget -- while preserving the flexibility of kernel methods to model nonlinear temporal functionals and being scalable to high-dimensional data. We further provide learning-theoretic generalization guarantees for dependent temporal data, linking design and resource choices to finite-sample performance, thereby offering principled guidance for building reliable temporal learners. Empirical experiments validate QuaRK and illustrate the predicted interpolation and generalization behaviours on synthetic beta-mixing time series tasks.

### [465] [Fast Swap-Based Element Selection for Multiplication-Free Dimension Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13532)
*Nobutaka Ono*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需乘法的维度约简方法——元素选择（element selection），通过选择输入向量中的特定子集来实现降维，并利用基于线性回归误差或重构误差的准则评估候选子集，再借助矩阵求逆引理设计高效交换式局部搜索算法进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA等降维方法依赖矩阵乘法，在资源受限设备上乘法运算本身成为瓶颈；而元素选择完全避免乘法，仅需索引选择，因此亟需解决如何最优选择元素子集的问题。

Method: 以最小化线性回归预测目标向量（如分类中的one-hot标签）的均方误差为优化目标；若无显式目标，则用输入自身作重构目标；针对组合优化难题，推导出基于矩阵求逆引理的元素交换目标变化闭式解，并采用贪心交换式局部搜索求解。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上的实验验证了该方法在保持性能的同时显著降低计算开销，尤其适用于乘法昂贵的边缘或嵌入式系统。

Conclusion: 元素选择是一种高效、轻量的维度约简范式；所提交换式局部搜索算法在精度与效率间取得良好平衡，为资源受限场景下的模型压缩与加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for element selection, a multiplication-free form of dimension reduction that produces a dimension-reduced vector by simply selecting a subset of elements from the input. Dimension reduction is a fundamental technique for reducing unnecessary model parameters, mitigating overfitting, and accelerating training and inference. A standard approach is principal component analysis (PCA), but PCA relies on matrix multiplications; on resource-constrained systems, the multiplication count itself can become a bottleneck. Element selection eliminates this cost because the reduction consists only of selecting elements, and thus the key challenge is to determine which elements should be retained. We evaluate a candidate subset through the minimum mean-squared error of linear regression that predicts a target vector from the selected elements, where the target may be, for example, a one-hot label vector in classification. When an explicit target is unavailable, the input itself can be used as the target, yielding a reconstruction-based criterion. The resulting optimization is combinatorial, and exhaustive search is impractical. To address this, we derive an efficient formula for the objective change caused by swapping a selected and an unselected element, using the matrix inversion lemma, and we perform a swap-based local search that repeatedly applies objective-decreasing swaps until no further improvement is possible. Experiments on MNIST handwritten-digit images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在关键行业中广泛应用，但面对训练分布之外（out-of-support, OoS）的数据时常常灾难性失效，产生不现实却过度自信的预测，亟需提升其在安全关键场景下的可靠性。

Method: 将OoS泛化问题重新建模为权重空间中的序列建模任务：将训练集按输入距离划分为同心壳（concentric shells），作为离散时间步；在此基础上构建WeightCaster框架，实现对OoS区域的渐进式、不确定性感知预测。

Result: 在合成余弦数据集和真实空气质量传感器数据上验证，WeightCaster性能达到或优于当前最优方法，同时保持高计算效率、可解释性和不确定性量化能力。

Conclusion: WeightCaster为OoS泛化提供了新范式，无需人工设计归纳偏置即可提升模型在分布外场景的鲁棒性与可信度，推动AI在安全关键领域的实际落地。

Abstract: As breakthroughs in deep learning transform key industries, models are increasingly required to extrapolate on datapoints found outside the range of the training set, a challenge we coin as out-of-support (OoS) generalisation. However, neural networks frequently exhibit catastrophic failure on OoS samples, yielding unrealistic but overconfident predictions. We address this challenge by reformulating the OoS generalisation problem as a sequence modelling task in the weight space, wherein the training set is partitioned into concentric shells corresponding to discrete sequential steps. Our WeightCaster framework yields plausible, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware predictions without necessitating explicit inductive biases, all the while maintaining high computational efficiency. Emprical validation on a synthetic cosine dataset and real-world air quality sensor readings demonstrates performance competitive or superior to the state-of-the-art. By enhancing reliability beyond in-distribution scenarios, these results hold significant implications for the wider adoption of artificial intelligence in safety-critical applications.

Motivation: 现有深度联合信源信道编码（DJSCC）方案在多用户MIMO-OFDM系统中因多用户干扰（MUI）和频率选择性衰落而性能饱和，难以满足6G语义通信对任务相关信息高效传输的需求。

Method: 提出一种非对称架构的下行MU-MIMO语义通信框架：发射端采用信道状态信息（CSI）与信噪比（SNR）感知的语义编码器和语义域神经预编码网络；接收端采用轻量级解码器，结合导频引导注意力机制实现隐式信道均衡与特征校准。

Result: 在3GPP信道模型下仿真表明，该框架在PSNR和分类准确率上显著优于DJSCC和传统分离式编码（SSCC），尤其在低SNR区域优势明显，同时保持低时延与边缘设备可部署性。

Conclusion: 所提场景自适应语义通信框架有效缓解了MU-MIMO-OFDM系统中的MUI与频率选择性衰落问题，为6G语义通信在真实多用户无线环境中的落地提供了可行技术路径。

Abstract: Semantic Communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for 6G networks, aiming to extract and transmit task-relevant information rather than minimizing bit errors. However, applying SemCom to realistic downlink Multi-User Multi-Input Multi-Output (MU-MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems remains challenging due to severe Multi-User Interference (MUI) and frequency-selective fading. Existing Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) schemes, primarily designed for point-to-point links, suffer from performance saturation in multi-user scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a scenario-adaptive MU-MIMO SemCom framework featuring an asymmetric architecture tailored for downlink transmission. At the transmitter, we introduce a scenario-aware semantic encoder that dynamically adjusts feature extraction based on Channel State Information (CSI) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), followed by a neural precoding network designed to mitigate MUI in the semantic domain. At the receiver, a lightweight decoder equipped with a novel pilot-guided attention mechanism is employed to implicitly perform channel equalization and feature calibration using reference pilot symbols. Extensive simulation results over 3GPP channel models demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms DJSCC and traditional Separate Source-Channel Coding (SSCC) schemes in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and classification accuracy, particularly in low-SNR regimes, while maintaining low latency and computational cost on edge devices.

Conclusion: 所提方法通过优化建模与变量离散化策略，有效平衡了聚类性能与模型可解释性，为可解释聚类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Clustering serves as a vital tool for uncovering latent data structures, and achieving both high accuracy and interpretability is essential. To this end, existing methods typically construct binary decision trees by solving mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems, often leading to significant computational costs and suboptimal solutions. Furthermore, binary decision trees frequently result in excessively deep structures, which makes them difficult to interpret. To mitigate these issues, we propose an interpretable clustering method based on optimal multiway-split decision trees, formulated as a 0-1 integer linear optimization problem. This reformulation renders the optimization problem more tractable compared to existing models. A key feature of our method is the integration of a one-dimensional K-means algorithm for the discretization of continuous variables, allowing for flexible and data-driven branching. Extensive numerical experiments on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of clustering accuracy and interpretability. Our method yields multiway-split decision trees with concise decision rules while maintaining competitive performance across various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 基准数据泄漏是LLM推荐中一个关键且此前被忽略的干扰因素，严重威胁评估的真实性与模型比较的公平性。

Abstract: The expanding integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems poses critical challenges to evaluation reliability. This paper identifies and investigates a previously overlooked issue: benchmark data leakage in LLM-based recommendation. This phenomenon occurs when LLMs are exposed to and potentially memorize benchmark datasets during pre-training or fine-tuning, leading to artificially inflated performance metrics that fail to reflect true model performance. To validate this phenomenon, we simulate diverse data leakage scenarios by conducting continued pre-training of foundation models on strategically blended corpora, which include user-item interactions from both in-domain and out-of-domain sources. Our experiments reveal a dual-effect of data leakage: when the leaked data is domain-relevant, it induces substantial but spurious performance gains, misleadingly exaggerating the model's capability. In contrast, domain-irrelevant leakage typically degrades recommendation accuracy, highlighting the complex and contingent nature of this contamination. Our findings reveal that data leakage acts as a critical, previously unaccounted-for factor in LLM-based recommendation, which could impact the true model performance. We release our code at https://github.com/yusba1/LLMRec-Data-Leakage.

Conclusion: 分布特性对图表示学习至关重要；所提方法首次同时建模两类分布特征，有效缓解过平滑，在保持表达力的同时提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Neighborhood Aggregation Strategy (NAS) is a widely used approach in graph embedding, underpinning both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) methods. However, NAS-based methods are identified to be prone to over-smoothing-the loss of node distinguishability with increased iterations-thereby limiting their effectiveness. This paper identifies two characteristics in a network, i.e., the distributions of nodes and node degrees that are critical for expressive representation but have been overlooked in existing methods. We show that these overlooked characteristics contribute significantly to over-smoothing of NAS-methods. To address this, we propose a novel weighted distribution-aware kernel that embeds nodes while taking their distributional characteristics into consideration. Our method has three distinguishing features: (1) it is the first method to explicitly incorporate both distributional characteristics; (2) it requires no optimization; and (3) it effectively mitigates the adverse effects of over-smoothing, allowing WL to preserve node distinguishability and expressiveness even after many iterations of embedding. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior community detection performance via spectral clustering, outperforming existing graph embedding methods, including deep learning methods, on standard benchmarks.

*Songyuan Li,Jia Hu,Ahmed M. Abdelmoniem,Geyong Min,Haojun Huang,Jiwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepFusion 是首个可扩展的联邦MoE训练框架，通过联邦知识蒸馏融合边缘设备上异构的LLM知识，构建全局MoE模型；提出View-Aligned Attention（VAA）模块解决跨架构知识蒸馏中的视角不匹配问题，在医疗与金融数据上显著降低通信开销并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习难以在资源受限设备上部署大型MoE模型，而集中式训练又违背隐私保护需求；亟需一种兼顾设备异构性、模型轻量化与知识有效聚合的联邦MoE训练方法。

Method: 提出DeepFusion框架：1）各设备独立配置并训练适配自身硬件与需求的轻量级LLM；2）设计View-Aligned Attention（VAA）模块，对齐全局MoE与本地LLM的多阶段特征表示，实现跨架构知识蒸馏。

Result: 在Qwen-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE及真实医疗/金融数据集上验证：性能接近中心化训练；相较主流联邦MoE基线，通信成本最高降低71%，token困惑度最高改善5.28%。

Conclusion: DeepFusion有效解决了联邦环境下MoE模型训练的设备异构性与知识融合难题，为隐私保护下的大模型协同训练提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) such as Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE are transforming generative AI in natural language processing. However, these models require vast and diverse training data. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by leveraging private data from heterogeneous edge devices for privacy-preserving MoE training. Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training. Compared with key federated MoE baselines, DeepFusion reduces communication costs by up to 71% and improves token perplexity by up to 5.28%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了联合时间序列链（Joint Time Series Chain）的新定义，用于在中断时间序列或两个相关时间序列中发现异常演化趋势，并设计了鲁棒性更强的识别方法和有效排序准则，在实验与实际制造应用中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列链（TSC）仅适用于单条时间序列，难以捕捉中断时间序列或跨多条相关时间序列中的异常演化模式，存在鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 提出联合时间序列链（Joint TSC）新定义，重点缓解时间序列中断或间隙带来的鲁棒性问题，并设计了一种有效的链排序准则以识别最优链。

Result: 在大量实证评估中，所提方法在定位异常演化模式方面优于现有TSC方法，并成功应用于Intel的真实制造业场景。

Conclusion: Joint TSC为跨时间序列建模演化模式提供了更鲁棒、更实用的新范式，拓展了TSC的应用边界。

Abstract: Time series chain (TSC) is a recently introduced concept that captures the evolving patterns in large scale time series. Informally, a time series chain is a temporally ordered set of subsequences, in which consecutive subsequences in the chain are similar to one another, but the last and the first subsequences maybe be dissimilar. Time series chain has the great potential to reveal latent unusual evolving trend in the time series, or identify precursor of important events in a complex system. Unfortunately, existing definitions of time series chains only consider finding chains in a single time series. As a result, they are likely to miss unexpected evolving patterns in interrupted time series, or across two related time series. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce a new definition called \textit{Joint Time Series Chain}, which is specially designed for the task of finding unexpected evolving trend across interrupted time series or two related time series. Our definition focuses on mitigating the robustness issues caused by the gap or interruption in the time series. We further propose an effective ranking criterion to identify the best chain. We demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing TSC work in locating unusual evolving patterns through extensive empirical evaluations. We further demonstrate the utility of our work with a real-life manufacturing application from Intel.

### [473] [Cumulative Utility Parity for Fair Federated Learning under Intermittent Client Participation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13651)
*Stefan Behfar,Richard Mortier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的联邦学习公平性原则——累积效用平等（cumulative utility parity），旨在解决客户端参与不均衡导致的长期代表性偏差问题，并通过可用性归一化的累积效用指标来区分物理限制与算法偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习公平方法仅关注每轮参与下的性能公平，忽略了客户端参与本身不均衡的问题，导致间歇性可用客户端长期被低估。

Method: 提出累积效用平等原则，并设计可用性归一化的累积效用指标，用于解耦物理约束与调度/聚合中的算法偏差；在时序偏斜、非独立同分布的联邦基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 所提方法显著提升了长期表征公平性，同时保持近乎完美的模型性能。

Conclusion: 公平性评估应从每轮转向长期参与机会维度，累积效用平等能更合理地衡量和保障间歇性客户端的长期受益权。

Abstract: In real-world federated learning (FL) systems, client participation is intermittent, heterogeneous, and often correlated with data characteristics or resource constraints. Existing fairness approaches in FL primarily focus on equalizing loss or accuracy conditional on participation, implicitly assuming that clients have comparable opportunities to contribute over time. However, when participation itself is uneven, these objectives can lead to systematic under-representation of intermittently available clients, even if per-round performance appears fair. We propose cumulative utility parity, a fairness principle that evaluates whether clients receive comparable long-term benefit per participation opportunity, rather than per training round. To operationalize this notion, we introduce availability-normalized cumulative utility, which disentangles unavoidable physical constraints from avoidable algorithmic bias arising from scheduling and aggregation. Experiments on temporally skewed, non-IID federated benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially improves long-term representation parity, while maintaining near-perfect performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种'流体智能体'（fluid-agent）环境框架，允许智能体动态创建新智能体，以应对现实中智能体数量不固定、可变的挑战；并定义了相应的博弈论解概念，通过扩展经典MARL基准实验验证了该框架能促使智能体团队按需动态调整规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中智能体数量并非固定或先验已知，且智能体可自主生成新智能体（如细胞分裂、公司分拆），而传统多智能体强化学习（MARL）主要研究固定数量智能体的交互，存在建模局限。

Method: 提出流体智能体环境框架，支持智能体动态生成；定义适用于该框架的博弈论解概念；在流体化改造的经典基准（Predator-Prey、Level-Based Foraging）及新设计环境中，实证评估多种MARL算法性能。

Result: 实验表明，所提框架能使智能体团队根据环境需求动态调整自身规模，并在新环境中展现出固定种群设定下无法实现的新型协作策略。

Conclusion: 流体智能体框架拓展了MARL的建模能力，为处理开放、动态变化的多智能体系统提供了新范式与可行路径。

Abstract: The primary focus of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been to study interactions among a fixed number of agents embedded in an environment. However, in the real world, the number of agents is neither fixed nor known a priori. Moreover, an agent can decide to create other agents (for example, a cell may divide, or a company may spin off a division). In this paper, we propose a framework that allows agents to create other agents; we call this a fluid-agent environment. We present game-theoretic solution concepts for fluid-agent games and empirically evaluate the performance of several MARL algorithms within this framework. Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings. We demonstrate that this framework yields agent teams that adjust their size dynamically to match environmental demands.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种策略驱动的零阶（ZO）优化框架，通过将扰动方向的采样分布建模为可学习策略来降低梯度估计方差，从而缓解传统ZO方法在大模型微调中因高方差和维度依赖导致的性能瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零阶优化方法因梯度估计方差高、对参数维度d敏感，难以用于大语言模型（LLM）微调；而LLM微调又面临反向传播和优化器状态带来的巨大内存开销。

Method: 提出策略驱动的ZO框架，将扰动方向的采样分布视为可学习策略，通过策略更新最小化方向导数估计的方差；设计了实用算法，并给出理论分析，证明学习到的采样分布能提升梯度信息质量并弱化收敛界中对d的显式依赖。

Result: 在多个LLM微调基准任务上显著优于标准ZO基线方法，验证了自适应方向采样的有效性与可扩展性。

Conclusion: 自适应方向采样是实现大规模零阶微调的一条有前景路径，有望推动内存受限场景下的LLM高效适配。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models (LLMs) is a cornerstone of modern NLP, yet its growing memory demands (driven by backpropagation and large optimizer States) limit deployment in resource-constrained settings. Zero-order (ZO) methods bypass backpropagation by estimating directional derivatives from forward evaluations, offering substantial memory savings. However, classical ZO estimators suffer from high variance and an adverse dependence on the parameter dimensionality $d$, which has constrained their use to low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a policy-driven ZO framework that treats the sampling distribution over perturbation directions as a learnable policy and updates it to reduce the variance of directional estimates. We develop a practical algorithm implementing this idea and provide a theoretical analysis, showing that learned sampling distributions improve the quality of gradient information and relax the explicit dependence on $d$ in convergence bounds. Empirically, we validate the approach on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, demonstrating substantially improved performance compared to standard ZO baselines. Our results suggest that adaptive direction sampling is a promising route to make ZO fine-tuning viable at scale. The source code is available at https://github.com/brain-lab-research/zo_ldsd

*Rohit Raj Rai,Abhishek Dhaka,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Alignment Adapter (AlAd)，一种轻量级滑动窗口适配器，用于对齐压缩模型与原始大模型的token级嵌入，从而提升压缩模型性能，且不依赖具体压缩方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩后的深度学习模型在资源受限环境下部署至关重要，但其性能通常落后于大型模型，亟需一种通用、高效的方法来弥补性能差距。

Method: 提出Alignment Adapter（AlAd），采用滑动窗口机制对齐压缩模型与原始大模型的token级嵌入；支持冻结压缩模型上即插即用，或联合微调以进一步提升性能；设计上兼容不同维度和架构，与压缩方法无关。

Result: 在BERT系列模型及三个token级NLP任务上的实验表明，AlAd显著提升压缩模型性能，仅带来极小的参数量和延迟开销。

Conclusion: AlAd是一种通用、轻量、架构无关的对齐适配器，有效弥合压缩模型与大模型之间的性能鸿沟，适用于多种压缩场景。

Abstract: Compressed Deep Learning (DL) models are essential for deployment in resource-constrained environments. But their performance often lags behind their large-scale counterparts. To bridge this gap, we propose Alignment Adapter (AlAd): a lightweight, sliding-window-based adapter. It aligns the token-level embeddings of a compressed model with those of the original large model. AlAd preserves local contextual semantics, enables flexible alignment across differing dimensionalities or architectures, and is entirely agnostic to the underlying compression method. AlAd can be deployed in two ways: as a plug-and-play module over a frozen compressed model, or by jointly fine-tuning AlAd with the compressed model for further performance gains. Through experiments on BERT-family models across three token-level NLP tasks, we demonstrate that AlAd significantly boosts the performance of compressed models with only marginal overhead in size and latency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Atomix运行时系统，为LLM智能体的工具调用提供具备进度感知能力的事务语义，以解决外部工具调用中副作用无法安全回滚的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在调用外部工具时，副作用立即生效，在失败、推测执行或资源竞争情况下，可能导致不安全的副作用泄露且无法回滚。

Method: Atomix通过为每次工具调用打上epoch标签、跟踪每资源的前沿（frontier）、依据进度谓词判断安全性来决定提交；支持缓冲可延迟效果，并对外部化效果进行跟踪与中止补偿。

Result: 在注入故障的真实工作负载实验中，事务性重试提升了任务成功率；前沿门控提交机制增强了推测执行和资源竞争下的隔离性。

Conclusion: Atomix有效提升了LLM智能体在复杂、不确定外部环境中的可靠性与安全性，为智能体系统提供了实用的事务保障机制。

Abstract: LLM agents increasingly act on external systems, yet tool effects are immediate. Under failures, speculation, or contention, losing branches can leak unintended side effects with no safe rollback. We introduce Atomix, a runtime that provides progress-aware transactional semantics for agent tool calls. Atomix tags each call with an epoch, tracks per-resource frontiers, and commits only when progress predicates indicate safety; bufferable effects can be delayed, while externalized effects are tracked and compensated on abort. Across real workloads with fault injection, transactional retry improves task success, while frontier-gated commit strengthens isolation under speculation and contention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出OCE-RCPS框架，利用优化确定性当量（OCE）风险度量（如CVaR、熵风险）和上置信界，为高风险场景（如医学图像分割）提供高概率风险控制保证，弥补传统RCPS在尾部行为与最坏情况建模上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风险控制预测集（RCPS）仅提供期望风险的保证，无法应对安全关键应用（如医学图像分割）中至关重要的尾部行为和最坏情况。

Method: 提出OCE-RCPS框架，将RCPS扩展至一般OCE风险度量（如CVaR、熵风险），通过上置信界选择满足用户指定风险容忍度的预测集参数，并给出理论保证。

Result: 理论证明OCE-RCPS对误覆盖率、假阴性率等损失函数满足高概率风险约束；实验表明其在图像分割任务中能稳定满足目标满意度，而基线方法OCE-CRC无法提供概率保证。

Conclusion: OCE-RCPS是一种具备严格理论保障、适用于高风险场景的风险控制新范式，显著提升了预测系统的可靠性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: In safety-critical applications such as medical image segmentation, prediction systems must provide reliability guarantees that extend beyond conventional expected loss control. While risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) offer probabilistic guarantees on the expected risk, they fail to capture tail behavior and worst-case scenarios that are crucial in high-stakes settings. This paper introduces optimized certainty equivalent RCPS (OCE-RCPS), a novel framework that provides high-probability guarantees on general optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) risk measures, including conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and entropic risk. OCE-RCPS leverages upper confidence bounds to identify prediction set parameters that satisfy user-specified risk tolerance levels with provable reliability. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that OCE-RCPS satisfies the desired probabilistic constraint for loss functions such as miscoverage and false negative rate. Experiments on image segmentation demonstrate that OCE-RCPS consistently meets target satisfaction rates across various risk measures and reliability configurations, while OCE-CRC fails to provide probabilistic guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了带有最优加性基线的β⋆-IPS估计器在均方误差上渐近优于自归一化逆倾向评分（SNIPS），并从理论上支持将评估方法从自归一化转向最优基线校正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管加性控制变量（基线校正）在离策略学习中表现更优，但其在离策略评估中的理论保证尚不完善，而SNIPS作为标准工具存在潜在次优性。

Method: 通过渐近分析和方差分解，严格证明β⋆-IPS估计器相较于SNIPS在均方误差意义下的渐近优势，并揭示SNIPS等价于使用某一特定但通常次优的加性基线。

Result: β⋆-IPS估计器在均方误差上渐近优于SNIPS；SNIPS被证明等价于一种特定的、通常非最优的加性基线形式。

Conclusion: 应从自归一化转向基于最优加性基线的离策略评估方法，该结论为排序与推荐系统的评估提供了新的理论依据。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is essential for assessing ranking and recommendation systems without costly online interventions. Self-Normalised Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) is a standard tool for variance reduction in OPE, leveraging a multiplicative control variate. Recent advances in off-policy learning suggest that additive control variates (baseline corrections) may offer superior performance, yet theoretical guarantees for evaluation are lacking. This paper provides a definitive answer: we prove that $β^\star$-IPS, an estimator with an optimal additive baseline, asymptotically dominates SNIPS in Mean Squared Error. By analytically decomposing the variance gap, we show that SNIPS is asymptotically equivalent to using a specific -- but generally sub-optimal -- additive baseline. Our results theoretically justify shifting from self-normalisation to optimal baseline corrections for both ranking and recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗代理系统中，单一模型难以在所有数据样本上表现最优，因此需要根据具体查询动态选择最合适的专用模型。

Method: 提出基于注意力神经过程（Attentive Neural Process）的工具选择器，该选择器以查询和各模型的行为摘要为条件，最小化任务条件下的选择损失的代理函数。

Result: 在新构建的ToolSelectBench基准（含1448个查询）上，ToolSelect在四类任务中持续优于10种SOTA方法。

Conclusion: ToolSelect为多模型协同的医疗代理系统提供了高效可靠的工具选择机制，推动了临床AI代理的实际落地。

Abstract: Task-specialized models form the backbone of agentic healthcare systems, enabling the agents to answer clinical queries across tasks such as disease diagnosis, localization, and report generation. Yet, for a given task, a single "best" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.

TL;DR: 本文提出ALMo系统，用于辅助宫颈癌高剂量率近距离放射治疗的临床决策，通过目标（aim）和限制（limit）阈值定义多目标优化，减少人工干预、提升计划质量与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策中需同时管理多个具有理想值（aim）和严格阈值（limit）的指标，高维权衡难以直观把握，易导致计划质量不一致和耗时长。

Method: 提出ALMo交互式决策支持系统，基于新型优化框架，自动配置参数，支持临床医生直接调节aim/limit值以探索Pareto最优解面，并兼顾毒性风险控制。

Result: 在25例回顾性临床案例中，65%的病例ALMo计划优于手动计划；平均计划时间降至约17分钟（原30–60分钟）。

Conclusion: ALMo提升了HDR近距离放疗计划的质量与效率，其aim-limit建模范式可推广至其他多准则临床决策场景。

Abstract: In complex clinical decision-making, clinicians must often track a variety of competing metrics defined by aim (ideal) and limit (strict) thresholds. Sifting through these high-dimensional tradeoffs to infer the optimal patient-specific strategy is cognitively demanding and historically prone to variability. In this paper, we address this challenge within the context of High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer, where planning requires strictly managing radiation hot spots while balancing tumor coverage against organ sparing. We present ALMo (Aim-Limit-defined Multi-Objective system), an interactive decision support system designed to infer and operationalize clinician intent. ALMo employs a novel optimization framework that minimizes manual input through automated parameter setup and enables flexible control over toxicity risks. Crucially, the system allows clinicians to navigate the Pareto surface of dosimetric tradeoffs by directly manipulating intuitive aim and limit values. In a retrospective evaluation of 25 clinical cases, ALMo generated treatment plans that consistently met or exceeded manual planning quality, with 65% of cases demonstrating dosimetric improvements. Furthermore, the system significantly enhanced efficiency, reducing average planning time to approximately 17 minutes, compared to the conventional 30-60 minutes. While validated in brachytherapy, ALMo demonstrates a generalized framework for streamlining interaction in multi-criteria clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: VILA成功弥合了解析学习的效率优势与其固有脆弱性之间的鸿沟，为PTM-based CIL提供了稳定、高效且可扩展的新范式。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) with pre-trained models (PTMs) faces a critical trade-off between efficient adaptation and long-term stability. While analytic learning enables rapid, recursive closed-form updates, its efficacy is often compromised by accumulated errors and feature incompatibility. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic study to dissect the failure modes of PTM-based analytic CIL, identifying representation rigidity as the primary bottleneck. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{VILA}, a novel dual-branch framework that advances analytic CIL via a two-level vision-language calibration strategy. Specifically, we coherently fuse plastic, task-adapted features with a frozen, universal semantic anchor at the feature level through geometric calibration, and leverage cross-modal priors at the decision level to rectify prediction bias. This confluence maintains analytic-learning's extreme efficiency while overcoming its inherent brittleness. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that VILA consistently yields superior performance, particularly in fine-grained and long-sequence scenarios. Our framework harmonizes high-fidelity prediction with the simplicity of analytic learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/byzhaoAI/VILA

Method: 利用VC维分析构造最优加性ε-coreset；通过顶点分析揭示LP中至多C(n,2)个三角不等式活跃；设计稀疏化LP-PIVOT算法，用三角不等式插补缺失边际；结合Yao极小极大原理进行下界分析。

Result: 证明CC聚类分歧类VC维恰为n−1；给出大小为Õ(n/ε²)的最优加性ε-coreset；证明稀疏LP-PIVOT在观测Õ(n^{3/2})条边时可实现(10/3)-近似（含可控加性误差项Γ̄_w）；并证明该阈值是紧的；同时证明非伪度量情形下o(n)随机采样将导致无界近似比。

Conclusion: 伪度量结构是CC可稀疏化的关键：它既保障算法可解性，也决定其对不完全信息的鲁棒性；本文建立了稀疏化程度与近似性能之间的精确理论边界。

Abstract: Correlation Clustering (CC) is a fundamental unsupervised learning primitive whose strongest LP-based approximation guarantees require $Θ(n^3)$ triangle inequality constraints and are prohibitive at scale. We initiate the study of \emph{sparsification--approximation trade-offs} for CC, asking how much edge information is needed to retain LP-based guarantees. We establish a structural dichotomy between pseudometric and general weighted instances. On the positive side, we prove that the VC dimension of the clustering disagreement class is exactly $n{-}1$, yielding additive $\varepsilon$-coresets of optimal size $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$; that at most $\binom{n}{2}$ triangle inequalities are active at any LP vertex, enabling an exact cutting-plane solver; and that a sparsified variant of LP-PIVOT, which imputes missing LP marginals via triangle inequalities, achieves a robust $\frac{10}{3}$-approximation (up to an additive term controlled by an empirically computable imputation-quality statistic $\overlineΓ_w$) once $\tildeΘ(n^{3/2})$ edges are observed, a threshold we prove is sharp. On the negative side, we show via Yao's minimax principle that without pseudometric structure, any algorithm observing $o(n)$ uniformly random edges incurs an unbounded approximation ratio, demonstrating that the pseudometric condition governs not only tractability but also the robustness of CC to incomplete information.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合物理约束（无散度矢量场和E(3)-协变性）的深度学习框架，用于提升机载磁异常导航中磁场建模的准确性与物理一致性，尤其在存在随机噪声和数据稀缺条件下表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPS不可用时，磁异常导航是重要替代方案，但机载系统受飞机自身磁干扰影响严重；经典Tolles-Lawson模型难以处理随机噪声，且现有深度学习方法缺乏物理一致性保障。

Method: 引入两个物理约束：1）无散度约束——通过神经网络学习矢量势A，磁场B=∇×A；2）E(3)-协变性——利用球谐函数表示的几何张量及其已知旋转变换实现；采用Contiformer等模型建模连续时间动态与长时记忆，并用WMM+条件GAN生成合成时序磁数据。

Result: 所提框架显著提升磁场预测精度与物理合理性，在CNN、MLP、LTC及Contiformer等多种架构上验证有效；Contiformer因兼具连续时间建模与长时记忆能力，性能最优；合成数据增强进一步缓解真实数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: 将先验物理规律（麦克斯韦方程、对称性）嵌入深度学习架构，可作为强隐式正则化手段，有效提升磁导航中磁场建模的鲁棒性、泛化性与可信度。

Abstract: Magnetic-anomaly navigation, leveraging small-scale variations in the Earth's magnetic field, is a promising alternative when GPS is unavailable or compromised. Airborne systems face a key challenge in extracting geomagnetic field data: the aircraft itself induces magnetic noise. Although the classical Tolles-Lawson model addresses this, it inadequately handles stochastically corrupted magnetic data required for navigation. To address stochastic noise, we propose a framework based on two physics-based constraints: divergence-free vector field and E(3)-equivariance. These ensure the learned magnetic field obeys Maxwell's equations and that outputs transform correctly with sensor position/orientation. The divergence-free constraint is implemented by training a neural network to output a vector potential $A$, with the magnetic field defined as its curl. For E(3)-equivariance, we use tensor products of geometric tensors representable via spherical harmonics with known rotational transformations. Enforcing physical consistency and restricting the admissible function space acts as an implicit regularizer that improves spatio-temporal performance. We present ablation studies evaluating each constraint alone and jointly across CNNs, MLPs, Liquid Time Constant models, and Contiformers. Continuous-time dynamics and long-term memory are critical for modelling magnetic time series; the Contiformer architecture, which provides both, outperforms state-of-the-art methods. To mitigate data scarcity, we generate synthetic datasets using the World Magnetic Model (WMM) with time-series conditional GANs, producing realistic, temporally consistent magnetic sequences across varied trajectories and environments. Experiments show that embedding these constraints significantly improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility, outperforming classical and unconstrained deep learning approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出Head Entropy方法，利用注意力熵模式预测大语言模型答案的正确性，在域内和跨域场景下均优于现有基线，尤其在问题/上下文阶段即具预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM易产生看似合理实则错误的回答，尤其在医疗等安全关键领域风险高；人工评估成本高，LLM-as-judge存在隐性错误；白盒检测方法虽能定位上下文幻觉，但尚不清楚是否可推广至答案正确性预测及跨领域泛化。

Method: 提出Head Entropy方法，基于每个注意力头的2-Renyi熵计算注意力质量分布的离散程度，并采用稀疏逻辑回归建模；同时探索仅使用问题/上下文阶段的注意力模式进行预测。

Result: Head Entropy在5个指令微调LLM和3个QA数据集（涵盖通用知识、多跳推理与医学）上，域内性能匹配或超越基线，跨域泛化显著更优，平均AUROC较最近基线提升+8.5%；仅用问题/上下文阶段注意力时，平均AUROC提升达+17.7%。

Conclusion: 注意力熵模式（特别是Head Entropy）是预测LLM答案正确性的有效且泛化性强的白盒指标，且预测信号早在生成前即已存在，为可信AI提供了轻量、可解释的校准新路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible yet incorrect answers, posing risks in safety-critical settings such as medicine. Human evaluation is expensive, and LLM-as-judge approaches risk introducing hidden errors. Recent white-box methods detect contextual hallucinations using model internals, focusing on the localization of the attention mass, but two questions remain open: do these approaches extend to predicting answer correctness, and do they generalize out-of-domains? We introduce Head Entropy, a method that predicts answer correctness from attention entropy patterns, specifically measuring the spread of the attention mass. Using sparse logistic regression on per-head 2-Renyi entropies, Head Entropy matches or exceeds baselines in-distribution and generalizes substantially better on out-of-domains, it outperforms the closest baseline on average by +8.5% AUROC. We further show that attention patterns over the question/context alone, before answer generation, already carry predictive signal using Head Entropy with on average +17.7% AUROC over the closest baseline. We evaluate across 5 instruction-tuned LLMs and 3 QA datasets spanning general knowledge, multi-hop reasoning, and medicine.

Abstract: We present the first high-probability optimal regret bound for a policy optimization technique applied to the problem of stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) with general offline function approximation. Our algorithm is both efficient and achieves an optimal regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{ K|\mathcal{A}|\log|\mathcal{F}|})$, where $K$ is the number of rounds, $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of arms, and $\mathcal{F}$ is the function class used to approximate the losses. Our results bridge the gap between theory and practice, demonstrating that the widely used policy optimization methods for the contextual bandit problem can achieve a rigorously-proved optimal regret bound. We support our theoretical results with an empirical evaluation of our algorithm.

Motivation: 解决随机上下文马尔可夫决策过程（CMDP）在离线函数逼近下的策略优化问题，改进现有方法对状态和动作空间大小的依赖。

Method: 提出OPO-CMDP算法，基于乐观策略优化框架，在一般离线函数逼近设定下进行策略学习。

Result: 获得高概率遗憾界\widetilde{O}(H^4\sqrt{T|S||A|\log(|\mathcal{F}||\mathcal{P}|)})，首次实现对|S|和|A|的最优依赖。

Conclusion: 乐观策略优化为求解CMDP提供了一条自然、计算高效且理论近优的路径。

Abstract: We introduce \texttt{OPO-CMDP}, the first policy optimization algorithm for stochastic Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDPs) under general offline function approximation. Our approach achieves a high probability regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(H^4\sqrt{T|S||A|\log(|\mathcal{F}||\mathcal{P}|)}),$ where $S$ and $A$ denote the state and action spaces, $H$ the horizon length, $T$ the number of episodes, and $\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P}$ the finite function classes used to approximate the losses and dynamics, respectively. This is the first regret bound with optimal dependence on $|S|$ and $|A|$, directly improving the current state-of-the-art (Qian, Hu, and Simchi-Levi, 2024). These results demonstrate that optimistic policy optimization provides a natural, computationally superior and theoretically near-optimal path for solving CMDPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型计算和内存开销大，难以部署于资源受限机器人；传统1比特二值化因分布差距导致长时闭环控制中量化误差累积，动作性能严重下降。

Method: 提出HBVLA：1）用策略感知增强Hessian识别对动作生成真正关键的权重；2）对非显著权重采用稀疏正交变换以诱导低熵中间状态；3）在Harr域对显著与非显著权重统一进行分组1比特量化。

Result: 在LIBERO上，二值化OpenVLA-OFT保持92.2%全精度性能；在SimplerEnv上，二值化CogAct保持93.6%；真实场景评估显示成功率仅轻微下降，部署鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: HBVLA为VLA模型超低位宽量化提供了实用基础，显著提升其在硬件受限机器人平台上的可靠部署能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable instruction-following embodied control, but their large compute and memory footprints hinder deployment on resource-constrained robots and edge platforms. While reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization can greatly improve efficiency, existing methods fail to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, causing quantization errors to accumulate under long-horizon closed-loop execution and severely degrade actions. To fill this gap, we propose HBVLA, a VLA-tailored binarization framework. First, we use a policy-aware enhanced Hessian to identify weights that are truly critical for action generation. Then, we employ a sparse orthogonal transform for non-salient weights to induce a low-entropy intermediate state. Finally, we quantize both salient and non-salient weights in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization. We have evaluated our approach on different VLAs: on LIBERO, quantized OpenVLA-OFT retains 92.2% of full-precision performance; on SimplerEnv, quantized CogAct retains 93.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art binarization methods. We further validate our method on real-world evaluation suite and the results show that HBVLA incurs only marginal success-rate degradation compared to the full-precision model, demonstrating robust deployability under tight hardware constraints. Our work provides a practical foundation for ultra-low-bit quantization of VLAs, enabling more reliable deployment on hardware-limited robotic platforms.

Motivation: 工业热电系统性能变量耦合且重要性层次分明，导致传统同步优化计算复杂甚至不可行，限制了其集成化与可扩展的运行优化。

Method: 构建全机器学习驱动的双层优化框架：上、下层目标函数由人工神经网络（ANN）建模；下层问题通过Karush-Kuhn-Tucker（KKT）最优性条件解析嵌入，形成单层ANN-KKT优化模型。

Result: 在基准问题及660MW燃煤电厂和395MW燃气轮机真实系统上验证有效；获得与双层优化相当的解，计算时间仅0.22–0.88秒；输出功率达583MW（煤）和402MW（气），热耗率分别为7337和7542 kJ/kWh；并能刻画考虑不确定性下的可行稳健运行包络，提升热效率。

Conclusion: ANN-KKT框架为工业热电系统提供了可扩展、高效率的分层数据驱动优化路径，支持大规模工程系统节能运行，助力工业5.0发展。

Abstract: Industrial thermal power systems have coupled performance variables with hierarchical order of importance, making their simultaneous optimization computationally challenging or infeasible. This barrier limits the integrated and computationally scaleable operation optimization of industrial thermal power systems. To address this issue for large-scale engineering systems, we present a fully machine learning-powered bi-level optimization framework for data-driven optimization of industrial thermal power systems. The objective functions of upper and lower levels are approximated by artificial neural network (ANN) models and the lower-level problem is analytically embedded through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. The reformulated single level optimization framework integrating ANN models and KKT constraints (ANN-KKT) is validated on benchmark problems and on real-world power generation operation of 660 MW coal power plant and 395 MW gas turbine system. The results reveal a comparable solutions obtained from the proposed ANN-KKT framework to the bi-level solutions of the benchmark problems. Marginal computational time requirement (0.22 to 0.88 s) to compute optimal solutions yields 583 MW (coal) and 402 MW (gas turbine) of power output at optimal turbine heat rate of 7337 kJ/kWh and 7542 kJ/kWh, respectively. In addition, the method expands to delineate a feasible and robust operating envelope that accounts for uncertainty in operating variables while maximizing thermal efficiency in various scenarios. These results demonstrate that ANN-KKT offers a scalable and computationally efficient route for hierarchical, data-driven optimization of industrial thermal power systems, achieving energy-efficient operations of large-scale engineering systems and contributing to industry 5.0.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种离散双括号流方法，用于矩阵自由的特征分解，其生成器对各向同性平移不变，从而在离散时间层面实现对σ_k^2 I 的路径不变性，并通过严格鞍点几何和输入-状态稳定性分析证明了全局收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的随机逼近方法要么使用耦合稳定性到‖C_k‖_2 的固定步长，要么以因更新衰减而变慢的方式自适应步长，无法有效应对带噪声协方差算子的矩阵自由特征分解问题。

Method: 引入一种离散双括号流，其生成器对各向同性平移不变；利用严格鞍点几何分析对角化目标函数，并结合输入-状态稳定性分析；给出最大稳定步长η_max ∝ 1/‖C_e‖_2^2 的显式表达；对退化块进行显式刻画以加速逃逸鞍点。

Result: 实现了对迹零协方差 C_e 的依赖性解耦；获得 O(‖C_e‖_2^2 / (Δ^2 ε)) 的样本复杂度；达到 O(log(1/ζ)) 的加速鞍点逃逸率；并给出高概率有限时间收敛保证。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了传统随机逼近在稳定性与收敛速度之间的权衡，为矩阵自由特征分解提供了更鲁棒、更高效的新范式。

Abstract: We study matrix-free eigendecomposition under a matrix-vector product (MVP) oracle, where each step observes a covariance operator $C_k = C_{sig} + σ_k^2 I + E_k$. Standard stochastic approximation methods either use fixed steps that couple stability to $\|C_k\|_2$, or adapt steps in ways that slow down due to vanishing updates. We introduce a discrete double-bracket flow whose generator is invariant to isotropic shifts, yielding pathwise invariance to $σ_k^2 I$ at the discrete-time level. The resulting trajectory and a maximal stable step size $η_{max} \propto 1/\|C_e\|_2^2$ depend only on the trace-free covariance $C_e$. We establish global convergence via strict-saddle geometry for the diagonalization objective and an input-to-state stability analysis, with sample complexity scaling as $O(\|C_e\|_2^2 / (Δ^2 ε))$ under trace-free perturbations. An explicit characterization of degenerate blocks yields an accelerated $O(\log(1/ζ))$ saddle-escape rate and a high-probability finite-time convergence guarantee.

Motivation: 工业级指令微调中缺乏系统性的大规模高质量数据选择方法，且现有LLM编码器生成的语义嵌入高度冗余。

Method: 提出CRDS框架，包含两个变体：CRDS-R使用Rademacher随机投影并拼接Transformer隐藏层表征；CRDS-W采用白化降维提升表征质量。

Result: 两种CRDS变体均显著优于现有基于表征的选择方法；CRDS-W仅用3.5%数据即在四个数据集上平均超越全量基线0.71%。

Conclusion: 压缩语义表征可有效缓解嵌入冗余，提升指令微调数据选择效果，CRDS为高质量小规模数据训练提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Data quality is a crucial factor in large language models training. While prior work has shown that models trained on smaller, high-quality datasets can outperform those trained on much larger but noisy or low-quality corpora, systematic methods for industrial-scale data selection in instruction tuning remain underexplored. In this work, we study instruction-tuning data selection through the lens of semantic representation similarity and identify a key limitation of state-of-the-art LLM encoders: they produce highly redundant semantic embeddings. To mitigate this redundancy, we propose Compressed Representation Data Selection (CRDS), a novel framework with two variants. CRDS-R applies Rademacher random projection followed by concatenation of transformer hidden-layer representations, while CRDS-W employs whitening-based dimensionality reduction to improve representational quality. Experimental results demonstrate that both variants substantially enhance data quality and consistently outperform state-of-the-art representation-based selection methods. Notably, CRDS-W achieves strong performance using only 3.5% of the data, surpassing the full-data baseline by an average of 0.71% across four datasets.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在真实垂直领域部署时因时间分布偏移和领域特有周期结构导致性能下降；DAPT易引发灾难性遗忘，RAG则带来高检索开销与扩展性瓶颈。

Method: 提出Memory for Time Series（MEMTS），核心是知识持久化模块（KPM），将领域特有动态（如季节性、趋势）编码为可学习的紧凑隐式原型，实现对冻结TSFM主干的即插即用、无检索适配。

Result: MEMTS在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，具备常数级推理时间、近零延迟，并有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: MEMTS是一种高效、轻量、无需修改主干架构的时间序列领域自适应新范式，显著提升TSFMs在实时流场景下的实用性。

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in generalized forecasting, their performance often degrades significantly when deployed in real-world vertical domains characterized by temporal distribution shifts and domain-specific periodic structures. Current solutions are primarily constrained by two paradigms: Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), which improves short-term domain fitting but frequently disrupts previously learned global temporal patterns due to catastrophic forgetting; and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which incorporates external knowledge but introduces substantial retrieval overhead. This creates a severe scalability bottleneck that fails to meet the high-efficiency requirements of real-time stream processing. To break this impasse, we propose Memory for Time Series (MEMTS), a lightweight and plug-and-play method for retrieval-free domain adaptation in time series forecasting. The key component of MEMTS is a Knowledge Persistence Module (KPM), which internalizes domain-specific temporal dynamics, such as recurring seasonal patterns and trends into a compact set of learnable latent prototypes. In doing so, it transforms fragmented historical observations into continuous, parameterized knowledge representations. This paradigm shift enables MEMTS to achieve accurate domain adaptation with constant-time inference and near-zero latency, while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general temporal patterns, all without requiring any architectural modifications to the frozen TSFM backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of MEMTS.

Conclusion: MechPert通过引导LLM建模有向调控关系，显著提升了扰动响应预测和扰动实验优先级排序的能力，尤其适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Predicting transcriptional responses to unseen genetic perturbations is essential for understanding gene regulation and prioritizing large-scale perturbation experiments. Existing approaches either rely on static, potentially incomplete knowledge graphs, or prompt language models for functionally similar genes, retrieving associations shaped by symmetric co-occurrence in scientific text rather than directed regulatory logic. We introduce MechPert, a lightweight framework that encourages LLM agents to generate directed regulatory hypotheses rather than relying solely on functional similarity. Multiple agents independently propose candidate regulators with associated confidence scores; these are aggregated through a consensus mechanism that filters spurious associations, producing weighted neighborhoods for downstream prediction. We evaluate MechPert on Perturb-seq benchmarks across four human cell lines. For perturbation prediction in low-data regimes ($N=50$ observed perturbations), MechPert improves Pearson correlation by up to 10.5\% over similarity-based baselines. For experimental design, MechPert-selected anchor genes outperform standard network centrality heuristics by up to 46\% in well-characterized cell lines.

Method: 提出Cast-R1框架：引入记忆机制管理决策状态；构建工具增强的智能体工作流（含特征提取、轻量模型调用、推理预测与自我反思）；采用两阶段学习（监督微调+多轮强化学习）与课程学习策略。

Result: 在多个真实时间序列数据集上验证了Cast-R1的有效性，显著提升预测性能。

Conclusion: Cast-R1为时间序列建模提供了可扩展的智能体范式，推动预测系统向自主、迭代、可解释方向发展。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has long been dominated by model-centric approaches that formulate prediction as a single-pass mapping from historical observations to future values. Despite recent progress, such formulations often struggle in complex and evolving settings, largely because most forecasting models lack the ability to autonomously acquire informative evidence, reason about potential future changes, or revise predictions through iterative decision processes. In this work, we propose Cast-R1, a learned time series forecasting framework that reformulates forecasting as a sequential decision-making problem. Cast-R1 introduces a memory-based state management mechanism that maintains decision-relevant information across interaction steps, enabling the accumulation of contextual evidence to support long-horizon reasoning. Building on this formulation, forecasting is carried out through a tool-augmented agentic workflow, in which the agent autonomously interacts with a modular toolkit to extract statistical features, invoke lightweight forecasting models for decision support, perform reasoning-based prediction, and iteratively refine forecasts through self-reflection. To train Cast-R1, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy that combines supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn reinforcement learning, together with a curriculum learning scheme that progressively increases task difficulty to improve policy learning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Cast-R1. We hope this work provides a practical step towards further exploration of agentic paradigms for time series modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaoyu-Tao/Cast-R1-TS.

Abstract: Untrained neural networks (UNNs) offer high-fidelity electromagnetic inverse scattering reconstruction but are computationally limited by high-dimensional spatial-domain optimization. We propose a Real-Time Physics-Driven Fourier-Spectral (PDF) solver that achieves sub-second reconstruction through spectral-domain dimensionality reduction. By expanding induced currents using a truncated Fourier basis, the optimization is confined to a compact low-frequency parameter space supported by scattering measurements. The solver integrates a contraction integral equation (CIE) to mitigate high-contrast nonlinearity and a contrast-compensated operator (CCO) to correct spectral-induced attenuation. Furthermore, a bridge-suppressing loss is formulated to enhance boundary sharpness between adjacent scatterers. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate a 100-fold speedup over state-of-the-art UNNs with robust performance under noise and antenna uncertainties, enabling real-time microwave imaging applications.

Conclusion: AnomaMind通过引入诊断式、迭代式、工具增强的推理范式，有效克服了传统判别式方法的局限，为时间序列异常检测提供了更鲁棒、可解释、可优化的新框架。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical in many real-world applications, where effective solutions must localize anomalous regions and support reliable decision-making under complex settings. However, most existing methods frame anomaly detection as a purely discriminative prediction task with fixed feature inputs, rather than an evidence-driven diagnostic process. As a result, they often struggle when anomalies exhibit strong context dependence or diverse patterns. We argue that these limitations stem from the lack of adaptive feature preparation, reasoning-aware detection, and iterative refinement during inference. To address these challenges, we propose AnomaMind, an agentic time series anomaly detection framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a sequential decision-making process. AnomaMind operates through a structured workflow that progressively localizes anomalous intervals in a coarse-to-fine manner, augments detection through multi-turn tool interactions for adaptive feature preparation, and refines anomaly decisions via self-reflection. The workflow is supported by a set of reusable tool engines, enabling context-aware diagnostic analysis. A key design of AnomaMind is an explicitly designed hybrid inference mechanism for tool-augmented anomaly detection. In this mechanism, general-purpose models are responsible for autonomous tool interaction and self-reflective refinement, while core anomaly detection decisions are learned through reinforcement learning under verifiable workflow-level feedback, enabling task-specific optimization within a flexible reasoning framework. Extensive experiments across diverse settings demonstrate that AnomaMind consistently improves anomaly detection performance. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AnomaMind.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于流的策略在表达能力和计算开销之间存在权衡，通常依赖流步骤数调节，限制了效率与灵活性。

Method: 提出均值速度策略（MVP），建模动作空间中的平均速度场以实现单步确定性采样；引入瞬时速度约束（IVC）作为训练时对速度场的正则化，并从理论上证明其作为关键边界条件可提升学习准确性和策略表达力。

Conclusion: MVP通过物理启发的速度场建模与理论保障的约束机制，在保持高表达力的同时实现极致高效的一次性动作生成，为RL策略设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Learning expressive and efficient policy functions is a promising direction in reinforcement learning (RL). While flow-based policies have recently proven effective in modeling complex action distributions with a fast deterministic sampling process, they still face a trade-off between expressiveness and computational burden, which is typically controlled by the number of flow steps. In this work, we propose mean velocity policy (MVP), a new generative policy function that models the mean velocity field to achieve the fastest one-step action generation. To ensure its high expressiveness, an instantaneous velocity constraint (IVC) is introduced on the mean velocity field during training. We theoretically prove that this design explicitly serves as a crucial boundary condition, thereby improving learning accuracy and enhancing policy expressiveness. Empirically, our MVP achieves state-of-the-art success rates across several challenging robotic manipulation tasks from Robomimic and OGBench. It also delivers substantial improvements in training and inference speed over existing flow-based policy baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pawsterior 是一种面向结构化领域的变分流匹配框架，通过引入端点诱导仿射几何约束和可处理离散潜变量的变分参数化，显著提升了模拟推断（SBI）在有界参数与混合离散-连续变量等场景下的性能与适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配方法通常在无约束空间中操作，难以有效处理受结构化域（如有界物理参数、混合离散-连续变量）约束的后验分布，导致学习效率低且难以满足物理约束。

Method: 提出 Pawsterior 框架：1）推广 CatFlow 的几何归纳偏置，形式化端点诱导仿射几何约束，采用双侧变分模型将域几何嵌入推理过程；2）设计支持离散潜结构的变分参数化，使流匹配能处理切换系统等传统方法无法建模的任务。

Result: 在标准 SBI 基准上，分类器双样本检验性能提升，采样数值稳定性增强，后验保真度更优；首次实现流匹配对含离散潜结构 SBI 任务的有效支持。

Conclusion: Pawsterior 通过统一处理几何约束与离散潜结构，显著扩展了流匹配在结构化模拟推断问题中的适用范围，为复杂物理与因果建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: We introduce Pawsterior, a variational flow-matching framework for improved and extended simulation-based inference (SBI). Many SBI problems involve posteriors constrained by structured domains, such as bounded physical parameters or hybrid discrete-continuous variables, yet standard flow-matching methods typically operate in unconstrained spaces. This mismatch leads to inefficient learning and difficulty respecting physical constraints. Our contributions are twofold. First, generalizing the geometric inductive bias of CatFlow, we formalize endpoint-induced affine geometric confinement, a principle that incorporates domain geometry directly into the inference process via a two-sided variational model. This formulation improves numerical stability during sampling and leads to consistently better posterior fidelity, as demonstrated by improved classifier two-sample test performance across standard SBI benchmarks. Second, and more importantly, our variational parameterization enables SBI tasks involving discrete latent structure (e.g., switching systems) that are fundamentally incompatible with conventional flow-matching approaches. By addressing both geometric constraints and discrete latent structure, Pawsterior extends flow-matching to a broader class of structured SBI problems that were previously inaccessible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于固定参考数据集的顺序检验方法，用于检测任意分布偏移，通过显式建模参考分布估计误差，构建条件于参考数据的稳健共形检验鞅（CTM），在保证任意时刻类型I错误控制的同时，提升检测功效与速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共形检验鞅（CTM）方法在检测分布偏移时，因持续将新样本加入参考集而导致‘测试时污染’，降低检测灵敏度和延迟性能。

Method: 提出一种固定参考条件下的顺序检验框架，构造条件于固定参考数据集的稳健检验鞅，显式建模有限参考集引起的参考分布估计误差，确保鞅的条件有效性。

Result: 理论保证： anytime-valid 类型I错误控制、渐近功效为1、有界期望检测延迟；实验表明比标准CTM更快检测到分布偏移。

Conclusion: 该方法通过避免测试时污染，在保持统计严谨性的同时显著提升了分布偏移检测的可靠性与效率，为实际部署提供了更优选择。

Abstract: We propose a sequential test for detecting arbitrary distribution shifts that allows conformal test martingales (CTMs) to work under a fixed, reference-conditional setting. Existing CTM detectors construct test martingales by continually growing a reference set with each incoming sample, using it to assess how atypical the new sample is relative to past observations. While this design yields anytime-valid type-I error control, it suffers from test-time contamination: after a change, post-shift observations enter the reference set and dilute the evidence for distribution shift, increasing detection delay and reducing power.
  In contrast, our method avoids contamination by design by comparing each new sample to a fixed null reference dataset. Our main technical contribution is a robust martingale construction that remains valid conditional on the null reference data, achieved by explicitly accounting for the estimation error in the reference distribution induced by the finite reference set. This yields anytime-valid type-I error control together with guarantees of asymptotic power one and bounded expected detection delay. Empirically, our method detects shifts faster than standard CTMs, providing a powerful and reliable distribution-shift detector.

Conclusion: 统一跨模态对齐结合合理缩放策略，可实现真实世界夜间生物信号的标签高效、通用建模。

Abstract: Tasks ranging from sleep staging to clinical diagnosis traditionally rely on standard polysomnography (PSG) devices, bedside monitors and wearable devices, which capture diverse nocturnal biosignals (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG, SpO$_2$). However, heterogeneity across devices and frequent sensor dropout pose significant challenges for unified modelling of these multimodal signals. We present \texttt{sleep2vec}, a foundation model for diverse and incomplete nocturnal biosignals that learns a shared representation via cross-modal alignment. \texttt{sleep2vec} is contrastively pre-trained on 42,249 overnight recordings spanning nine modalities using a \textit{Demography, Age, Site \& History-aware InfoNCE} objective that incorporates physiological and acquisition metadata (\textit{e.g.}, age, gender, recording site) to dynamically weight negatives and mitigate cohort-specific shortcuts. On downstream sleep staging and clinical outcome assessment, \texttt{sleep2vec} consistently outperforms strong baselines and remains robust to any subset of available modalities and sensor dropout. We further characterize, to our knowledge for the first time, scaling laws for nocturnal biosignals with respect to modality diversity and model capacity. Together, these results show that unified cross-modal alignment, coupled with principled scaling, enables label-efficient, general-purpose modelling of real-world nocturnal biosignals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了实现零训练误差的深度ReLU齐次神经网络（采用最小L2范数参数）的算法稳定性，发现其稳定性依赖于是否存在稳定的子网络及后续层权重矩阵是否低秩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法稳定性是分析学习算法泛化误差的经典框架，但在深度神经网络分析中效果有限；本文旨在探索过参数化深度ReLU网络在最小范数插值下的稳定性条件。

Method: 理论分析方法，探讨深度ReLU齐次网络在最小L2范数解下的算法稳定性，重点分析稳定子网络与后续层权重矩阵秩之间的关系。

Result: 1）若网络包含稳定子网络且其后接低秩权重矩阵层，则整体网络稳定；2）即使存在稳定子网络，若后续层权重矩阵不满足低秩，则不能保证整体稳定；低秩假设受实证与理论中梯度优化偏向低秩权重的启发。

Conclusion: 深度ReLU齐次网络的算法稳定性并非仅由子网络稳定性决定，还需后续层权重矩阵满足低秩条件；该结论为理解过参数化网络泛化能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is a classical framework for analyzing the generalization error of learning algorithms. It predicts that an algorithm has small generalization error if it is insensitive to small perturbations in the training set such as the removal or replacement of a training point. While stability has been demonstrated for numerous well-known algorithms, this framework has had limited success in analyses of deep neural networks. In this paper we study the algorithmic stability of deep ReLU homogeneous neural networks that achieve zero training error using parameters with the smallest $L_2$ norm, also known as the minimum-norm interpolation, a phenomenon that can be observed in overparameterized models trained by gradient-based algorithms. We investigate sufficient conditions for such networks to be stable. We find that 1) such networks are stable when they contain a (possibly small) stable sub-network, followed by a layer with a low-rank weight matrix, and 2) such networks are not guaranteed to be stable even when they contain a stable sub-network, if the following layer is not low-rank. The low-rank assumption is inspired by recent empirical and theoretical results which demonstrate that training deep neural networks is biased towards low-rank weight matrices, for minimum-norm interpolation and weight-decay regularization.

Conclusion: GNN在仓库级缺陷定位中具有巨大潜力，GREPO作为首个专用基准，为后续研究提供了重要基础资源。

Abstract: Repository-level bug localization-the task of identifying where code must be modified to fix a bug-is a critical software engineering challenge. Standard Large Language Modles (LLMs) are often unsuitable for this task due to context window limitations that prevent them from processing entire code repositories. As a result, various retrieval methods are commonly used, including keyword matching, text similarity, and simple graph-based heuristics such as Breadth-First Search. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising alternative due to their ability to model complex, repository-wide dependencies; however, their application has been hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce GREPO, the first GNN benchmark for repository-scale bug localization tasks. GREPO comprises 86 Python repositories and 47294 bug-fixing tasks, providing graph-based data structures ready for direct GNN processing. Our evaluation of various GNN architectures shows outstanding performance compared to established information retrieval baselines. This work highlights the potential of GNNs for bug localization and established GREPO as a foundation resource for future research, The code is available at https://github.com/qingpingmo/GREPO.

*Zhimin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一个基于信息结构的五级可学习性层次结构，指出机器学习进展的上限更多取决于任务是否可学习，而非模型规模大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成比强化学习更可靠，因为代码具有提供密集、局部、可验证反馈的信息结构，而大多数强化学习问题缺乏这种高质量反馈。本文旨在通过形式化分析，解释为何不同任务在机器学习中表现出显著不同的可扩展性和可学习性。

Method: 构建一个基于信息结构的五级可学习性层次结构；形式化区分计算问题的三个性质（可表达性、可计算性、可学习性），并分析其两两关系与蕴含关系；提出统一模板以显式揭示结构性差异。

Result: 明确了可表达性、可计算性与可学习性之间的逻辑关系（如可学习性蕴含可计算性但不反之）；解释了代码监督学习可预测扩展而强化学习不可靠的根本原因；质疑了仅靠模型规模扩大即可解决所有ML挑战的普遍假设。

Conclusion: 任务的信息结构（尤其是反馈质量）决定了其可学习性层级，进而设定了机器学习性能的理论天花板；未来研究应更关注任务结构设计与反馈机制优化，而非单纯扩大模型规模。

Abstract: Code generation has progressed more reliably than reinforcement learning, largely because code has an information structure that makes it learnable. Code provides dense, local, verifiable feedback at every token, whereas most reinforcement learning problems do not. This difference in feedback quality is not binary but graded. We propose a five-level hierarchy of learnability based on information structure and argue that the ceiling on ML progress depends less on model size than on whether a task is learnable at all. The hierarchy rests on a formal distinction among three properties of computational problems (expressibility, computability, and learnability). We establish their pairwise relationships, including where implications hold and where they fail, and present a unified template that makes the structural differences explicit. The analysis suggests why supervised learning on code scales predictably while reinforcement learning does not, and why the common assumption that scaling alone will solve remaining ML challenges warrants scrutiny.

Motivation: 传统AutoML框架是黑箱，缺乏灵活性与透明性；LLM-based代理易产生幻觉逻辑和逻辑纠缠，导致不可恢复的运行失败。

Method: 提出iML多智能体框架，包含三个核心机制：(1) 代码引导规划（基于实证分析消除幻觉）；(2) 代码模块化实现（解耦预处理与建模，采用严格接口契约）；(3) 代码可验证集成（通过动态契约验证与自校正确保物理可行性）。

Result: 在MLE-BENCH上有效提交率达85%，获奖率45%，平均标准化性能分（APS）为0.77；在新提出的iML-BENCH上APS领先其他方法38%-163%；即使任务描述被大幅简化，仍保持70%成功率。

Conclusion: iML成功将AutoML从黑箱提示转向代码引导、模块化、可验证的工程范式，显著提升可靠性与鲁棒性，推动AutoML向真正自动化与工程化迈进。

Abstract: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has revolutionized the development of data-driven solutions; however, traditional frameworks often function as "black boxes", lacking the flexibility and transparency required for complex, real-world engineering tasks. Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shifted toward code-driven approaches. However, they frequently suffer from hallucinated logic and logic entanglement, where monolithic code generation leads to unrecoverable runtime failures. In this paper, we present iML, a novel multi-agent framework designed to shift AutoML from black-box prompting to a code-guided, modular, and verifiable architectural paradigm. iML introduces three main ideas: (1) Code-Guided Planning, which synthesizes a strategic blueprint grounded in autonomous empirical profiling to eliminate hallucination; (2) Code-Modular Implementation, which decouples preprocessing and modeling into specialized components governed by strict interface contracts; and (3) Code-Verifiable Integration, which enforces physical feasibility through dynamic contract verification and iterative self-correction. We evaluate iML across MLE-BENCH and the newly introduced iML-BENCH, comprising a diverse range of real-world Kaggle competitions. The experimental results show iML's superiority over state-of-the-art agents, achieving a valid submission rate of 85% and a competitive medal rate of 45% on MLE-BENCH, with an average standardized performance score (APS) of 0.77. On iML-BENCH, iML significantly outperforms the other approaches by 38%-163% in APS. Furthermore, iML maintains a robust 70% success rate even under stripped task descriptions, effectively filling information gaps through empirical profiling. These results highlight iML's potential to bridge the gap between stochastic generation and reliable engineering, marking a meaningful step toward truly AutoML.

TL;DR: 本文提出AHSIV框架，一种面向间歇性与变异性需求的自适应混合模型选择方法，通过引入预测周期衰减、多目标帕累托支配和分层偏差修正等机制，在多数据集上验证了其在多SKU场景下提升周期特异性模型选择能力的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实商业环境中需求具有结构性间歇性、高变异性及多步预测周期，导致传统模型选择方法存在排名不稳定、指标依赖性强、缺乏结构适配性等问题，亟需鲁棒且可复现的动态选择机制。

Method: 提出AHSIV（Adaptive Hybrid Selector for Intermittency and Variability）框架，融合：1）基于预测周期的误差度量衰减（MDFH）；2）结构性需求分类；3）多目标帕累托优势判定；4）分层偏差精调；构建统一的周期感知、需求态条件化决策架构。

Result: 在Walmart、M3、M4、M5数据集及多种训练/测试划分和12步预测周期下，AHSIV在整体性能上与最优单指标基线统计等效，并显著提高各预测周期下‘最优模型’的选择频率。

Conclusion: 多SKU预测中的模型选择不应视为静态排序问题；周期一致、结构自适应的机制是实现操作连贯性与理论严谨性的可行路径。

Abstract: Business environments characterized by structural demand intermittency, high variability, and multi-step planning horizons require robust and reproducible model selection mechanisms. Empirical evidence shows that no forecasting model is universally dominant and that relative rankings vary across error metrics, demand regimes, and forecast horizons, generating ambiguity in multi-SKU decision contexts. This study proposes AHSIV (Adaptive Hybrid Selector for Intermittency and Variability), a horizon-aware and regime-conditioned model selection framework designed to address horizon-induced ranking instability. The proposed approach integrates scaled and absolute error metrics adjusted through a Metric Degradation by Forecast Horizon (MDFH) procedure, structural demand classification, multi-objective Pareto dominance, and hierarchical bias refinement within a unified decision architecture. The empirical evaluation is conducted on the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets under multiple train-test partition schemes and twelve-step forecasting horizons. Results indicate that AHSIV achieves statistical equivalence with the strongest monometric baseline in terms of aggregated performance while increasing the frequency of horizon-specific best-model selection. The findings demonstrate that model selection in heterogeneous demand environments cannot be treated as a static ranking problem, and that horizon-consistent, structurally adaptive mechanisms provide a principled, operationally coherent solution for multi-SKU forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM训练流程中tokenization是硬编码的压缩步骤，与端到端趋势不符；已有工作尝试将其内化，但所用straight-through估计理论保证较弱。

Method: 采用score function估计直接优化离散token边界以最小化损失，并结合强化学习中的时间折扣技术降低估计方差。

Result: 在1亿参数规模上，该方法在定性和定量上均优于先前的straight-through估计方法。

Conclusion: score function估计是一种更优、理论保障更强的学习token边界的端到端方法，适用于大规模LLM训练。

Abstract: Tokenization is a hardcoded compression step which remains in the training pipeline of Large Language Models (LLMs), despite a general trend towards architectures becoming increasingly end-to-end. Prior work has shown promising results at scale in bringing this compression step inside the LLMs' architecture with heuristics to draw token boundaries, and also attempts to learn these token boundaries with straight-through estimates, which treat the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries as a continuous one. We show that these token boundaries can instead be learned using score function estimates, which have tighter theoretical guarantees due to directly optimizing the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries to minimize loss. We observe that techniques from reinforcement learning, such as time discounting, are necessary to reduce the variance of this score function sufficiently to make it practicable. We demonstrate that the resultant method outperforms prior proposed straight-through estimates, both qualitatively and quantitatively at the $100$ million parameter scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为经验式强化学习（ERL）的新训练范式，通过在强化学习中嵌入‘体验-反思-巩固’循环，将稀疏延迟的环境反馈转化为结构化的行为修正，从而提升语言模型的学习效率与最终性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在处理稀疏且延迟的环境反馈时面临挑战，模型难以将失败经验有效转化为后续行为改进。

Method: 引入Experiential Reinforcement Learning（ERL），让模型对任务先生成初始尝试，接收反馈后生成反思，再据此生成改进的第二次尝试，并将该成功尝试强化并内化到基础策略中。

Result: 在稀疏奖励控制环境和智能体推理基准上，ERL显著优于强基线方法：复杂多步环境中提升达+81%，工具使用推理任务中提升达+11%。

Conclusion: 在策略训练中引入显式自我反思，是一种将反馈转化为持久行为改进的有效实用机制。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the central approach for language models (LMs) to learn from environmental reward or feedback. In practice, the environmental feedback is usually sparse and delayed. Learning from such signals is challenging, as LMs must implicitly infer how observed failures should translate into behavioral changes for future iterations. We introduce Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a training paradigm that embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the reinforcement learning process. Given a task, the model generates an initial attempt, receives environmental feedback, and produces a reflection that guides a refined second attempt, whose success is reinforced and internalized into the base policy. This process converts feedback into structured behavioral revision, improving exploration and stabilizing optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost. Across sparse-reward control environments and agentic reasoning benchmarks, ERL consistently improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong reinforcement learning baselines, achieving gains of up to +81% in complex multi-step environments and up to +11% in tool-using reasoning tasks. These results suggest that integrating explicit self-reflection into policy training provides a practical mechanism for transforming feedback into durable behavioral improvement.

TL;DR: 本文提出Quantized Reinforcement Learning (QuRL)方法，通过使用量化actor加速推理大模型的强化学习训练中的rollout过程，解决了量化导致的长期训练崩溃和权重更新难以捕捉的问题，实现了20%至80%的rollout加速。


<details>

Motivation: 由于大语言模型自回归解码特性，强化学习训练中的rollout过程成为效率瓶颈，占总训练时间高达70%，亟需加速。

Method: 提出Quantized Reinforcement Learning（QuRL），包含两个关键技术：1）自适应裁剪范围（ACR），根据全精度与量化actor之间的策略比率动态调整裁剪比例；2）不变缩放技术（invariant scaling），缓解量化噪声并增强权重更新效果。

Result: 在DeepScaleR和DAPO上进行INT8和FP8量化实验，rollout速度提升20%至80%。

Conclusion: QuRL有效缓解了RLVR中rollout效率瓶颈问题，在保持训练稳定性的同时显著提升了训练速度，为推理大模型的高效强化学习训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a trending paradigm for training reasoning large language models (LLMs). However, due to the autoregressive decoding nature of LLMs, the rollout process becomes the efficiency bottleneck of RL training, consisting of up to 70\% of the total training time. In this work, we propose Quantized Reinforcement Learning (QuRL) that uses a quantized actor for accelerating the rollout. We address two challenges in QuRL. First, we propose Adaptive Clipping Range (ACR) that dynamically adjusts the clipping ratio based on the policy ratio between the full-precision actor and the quantized actor, which is essential for mitigating long-term training collapse. Second, we identify the weight update problem, where weight changes between RL steps are extremely small, making it difficult for the quantization operation to capture them effectively. We mitigate this problem through the invariant scaling technique that reduces quantization noise and increases weight update. We evaluate our method with INT8 and FP8 quantization experiments on DeepScaleR and DAPO, and achieve 20% to 80% faster rollout during training.

*Ho-Hsuan Wang,Afnan Sultan,Andrea Volkamer,Dietrich Klakow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文开发了针对天然产物（NPs）的化学语言模型（NPCLMs），首次系统比较了状态空间模型（Mamba/Mamba-2）与Transformer（GPT）在NP任务上的性能，发现Mamba在分子生成有效性和性质预测上略优于GPT，且仅用约100万NP数据即可媲美更大规模通用数据集训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天然产物（NPs）在药物发现中至关重要，但在当前化学语言模型研究中仍被忽视；现有模型多基于通用小分子数据，缺乏NP特异性建模。

Method: 预训练NP特异的状态空间模型（Mamba和Mamba-2）与Transformer基线（GPT），使用约100万天然产物SMILES数据；对比8种分词策略（如AIS、BPE、NP-BPE）；评估分子生成（有效性、唯一性、新颖性）和性质预测（膜通透性、味道、抗癌活性）性能。

Result: Mamba生成的有效、唯一分子比Mamba-2和GPT高1–2%，长程依赖错误更少；GPT新颖性略高；性质预测中，Mamba在随机划分下MCC比GPT高0.02–0.04，骨架划分下性能相当；NP专用预训练模型仅用1M数据即达到百倍更大通用数据集的性能水平。

Conclusion: 针对天然产物的领域特异性预训练可显著提升模型性能，状态空间模型（尤其是Mamba）是NP建模的有力候选，有望推动NP导向的AI药物发现。

Abstract: Language models are widely used in chemistry for molecular property prediction and small-molecule generation, yet Natural Products (NPs) remain underexplored despite their importance in drug discovery. To address this gap, we develop NP-specific chemical language models (NPCLMs) by pre-training state-space models (Mamba and Mamba-2) and comparing them with transformer baselines (GPT). Using a dataset of about 1M NPs, we present the first systematic comparison of selective state-space models and transformers for NP-focused tasks, together with eight tokenization strategies including character-level, Atom-in-SMILES (AIS), byte-pair encoding (BPE), and NP-specific BPE. We evaluate molecule generation (validity, uniqueness, novelty) and property prediction (membrane permeability, taste, anti-cancer activity) using MCC and AUC-ROC. Mamba generates 1-2 percent more valid and unique molecules than Mamba-2 and GPT, with fewer long-range dependency errors, while GPT yields slightly more novel structures. For property prediction, Mamba variants outperform GPT by 0.02-0.04 MCC under random splits, while scaffold splits show comparable performance. Results demonstrate that domain-specific pre-training on about 1M NPs can match models trained on datasets over 100 times larger.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常步长SA算法在实践中广泛应用，但其稳态分布难以解析刻画；已有弱收敛结果（α→0时趋于高斯）缺乏对固定步长α的实用误差控制，亟需非渐近、显式、可计算的逼近误差界。

Method: 建立通用定理，利用漂移正则性与噪声矩条件，在i.i.d.和马尔可夫噪声下控制中心化缩放稳态分布与适当高斯分布间的Wasserstein距离；再分别实例化于SGD（强凸/一般凸）、线性SA和压缩非线性SA；进一步基于Wasserstein误差推导非一致Berry–Esseen尾部界，并对一般凸SGD分析其Gibbs型极限及对应误差。

Result: 获得三类SA设置下O(α^{1/2} log(1/α))阶显式Wasserstein误差界；推出与偏差水平和步长α均衰减的尾部误差界；首次揭示一般凸SGD在正确缩放下收敛于Gibbs分布，并给出其预极限Wasserstein误差界；所有结果均经数值验证。

Conclusion: 本文突破了传统渐近分析局限，为常步长SA稳态行为提供了首个系统性、非渐近、显式且适用广泛的高斯（及非高斯）逼近理论框架，兼具理论深度与实践指导价值。

Abstract: Constant-stepsize stochastic approximation (SA) is widely used in learning for computational efficiency. For a fixed stepsize, the iterates typically admit a stationary distribution that is rarely tractable. Prior work shows that as the stepsize $α\downarrow 0$, the centered-and-scaled steady state converges weakly to a Gaussian random vector. However, for fixed $α$, this weak convergence offers no usable error bound for approximating the steady-state by its Gaussian limit. This paper provides explicit, non-asymptotic error bounds for fixed $α$. We first prove general-purpose theorems that bound the Wasserstein distance between the centered-scaled steady state and an appropriate Gaussian distribution, under regularity conditions for drift and moment conditions for noise. To ensure broad applicability, we cover both i.i.d. and Markovian noise models. We then instantiate these theorems for three representative SA settings: (1) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for smooth strongly convex objectives, (2) linear SA, and (3) contractive nonlinear SA. We obtain dimension- and stepsize-dependent, explicit bounds in Wasserstein distance of order $α^{1/2}\log(1/α)$ for small $α$. Building on the Wasserstein approximation error, we further derive non-uniform Berry--Esseen-type tail bounds that compare the steady-state tail probability to Gaussian tails. We achieve an explicit error term that decays in both the deviation level and stepsize $α$. We adapt the same analysis for SGD beyond strongly convexity and study general convex objectives. We identify a non-Gaussian (Gibbs) limiting law under the correct scaling, which is validated numerically, and provide a corresponding pre-limit Wasserstein error bound.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出KoopGen，一种基于生成器的神经Koopman框架，通过结构化、状态依赖的Koopman生成器表示来建模动力系统，在保持算子理论约束的同时分离保守输运与不可逆耗散，显著提升高维混沌与时空动力系统的预测精度、稳定性与可解释性。


<details>

Method: 提出KoopGen框架，利用Koopman生成器的状态依赖表示，并基于内在笛卡尔分解（斜自伴与自伴部分）分离保守与耗散动力学，学习过程中严格满足算子理论约束。

Result: 在非线性振荡器、高维混沌及时空动力系统上，KoopGen提升了预测精度与长期稳定性，并明确了连续谱动力学中哪些成分具备可解释且可学习的表示。

Conclusion: KoopGen为高维、时空混沌系统提供了兼具理论严谨性、数值鲁棒性与物理可解释性的新型数据驱动建模范式。

Abstract: Representing and predicting high-dimensional and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems remains a fundamental challenge in dynamical systems and machine learning. Although data-driven models can achieve accurate short-term forecasts, they often lack stability, interpretability, and scalability in regimes dominated by broadband or continuous spectra. Koopman-based approaches provide a principled linear perspective on nonlinear dynamics, but existing methods rely on restrictive finite-dimensional assumptions or explicit spectral parameterizations that degrade in high-dimensional settings. Against these issues, we introduce KoopGen, a generator-based neural Koopman framework that models dynamics through a structured, state-dependent representation of Koopman generators. By exploiting the intrinsic Cartesian decomposition into skew-adjoint and self-adjoint components, KoopGen separates conservative transport from irreversible dissipation while enforcing exact operator-theoretic constraints during learning. Across systems ranging from nonlinear oscillators to high-dimensional chaotic and spatiotemporal dynamics, KoopGen improves prediction accuracy and stability, while clarifying which components of continuous-spectrum dynamics admit interpretable and learnable representations.

TL;DR: 本文提出S2SServiceBench——一个面向次季节至季节（S2S）气候服务“最后一公里”问题的多模态基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）及智能体在不确定性下生成可操作气候服务交付物的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有S2S预报存在“最后一公里”瓶颈：难以将科学预报可靠转化为用户信任、可行动的气候服务，亟需具备多模态理解与不确定性下决策导向推理能力的AI系统。

Method: 构建了S2SServiceBench基准，涵盖6个应用领域、10类服务产品、约150+专家筛选案例，每例按三级服务深度展开，形成约500项任务、1000+评估项；并基于该基准对前沿MLLMs和智能体进行系统评测与归因分析。

Conclusion: S2SServiceBench为评估和推动面向气候韧性与可持续发展的可信AI气候服务智能体提供了首个标准化多模态基准，并为后续研究与系统构建提供了具体改进方向。

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts play an essential role in providing a decision-critical weeks-to-months planning window for climate resilience and sustainability, yet a growing bottleneck is the last-mile gap: translating scientific forecasts into trusted, actionable climate services, requiring reliable multimodal understanding and decision-facing reasoning under uncertainty. Meanwhile, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and corresponding agentic paradigms have made rapid progress in supporting various workflows, but it remains unclear whether they can reliably generate decision-making deliverables from operational service products (e.g., actionable signal comprehension, decision-making handoff, and decision analysis & planning) under uncertainty. We introduce S2SServiceBench, a multimodal benchmark for last-mile S2S climate services curated from an operational climate-service system to evaluate this capability. S2SServiceBenchcovers 10 service products with about 150+ expert-selected cases in total, spanning six application domains - Agriculture, Disasters, Energy, Finance, Health, and Shipping. Each case is instantiated at three service levels, yielding around 500 tasks and 1,000+ evaluation items across climate resilience and sustainability applications. Using S2SServiceBench, we benchmark state-of-the-art MLLMs and agents, and analyze performance across products and service levels, revealing persistent challenges in S2S service plot understanding and reasoning - namely, actionable signal comprehension, operationalizing uncertainty into executable handoffs, and stable, evidence-grounded analysis and planning for dynamic hazards-while offering actionable guidance for building future climate-service agents.

*Xinxing Zhou,Qingren Yao,Yiji Zhao,Chenghao Liu,Flora Salim,Xiaojie Yuan,Yanlong Wen,Ming Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出EIDOS模型家族，通过在潜在空间中进行预测学习而非直接预测未来观测值，以提升时间序列基础模型的表征结构性和时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型多采用直接预测未来观测值的方式预训练，导致潜在表征结构松散、易受噪声干扰，难以捕捉稳健可预测的时序动态。

Method: 设计基于因果Transformer的潜在空间预测框架；引入轻量聚合分支构建稳定目标表征；采用联合优化目标，融合潜在空间对齐、观测信号锚定和直接预测监督。

Result: 在GIFT-Eval基准上缓解了表征空间的结构碎片化问题，达到当前最优性能。

Conclusion: 约束模型学习可预测的潜在动态是构建更鲁棒、可靠时间序列基础模型的重要原则。

Abstract: Most time series foundation models are pretrained by directly predicting future observations, which often yields weakly structured latent representations that capture surface noise rather than coherent and predictable temporal dynamics. In this work, we introduce EIDOS, a foundation model family that shifts pretraining from future value prediction to latent-space predictive learning. We train a causal Transformer to predict the evolution of latent representations, encouraging the emergence of structured and temporally coherent latent states. To ensure stable targets for latent-space learning, we design a lightweight aggregation branch to construct target representations. EIDOS is optimized via a joint objective that integrates latent-space alignment, observational grounding to anchor representations to the input signal, and direct forecasting supervision. On the GIFT-Eval benchmark, EIDOS mitigates structural fragmentation in the representation space and achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results demonstrate that constraining models to learn predictable latent dynamics is a principled step toward more robust and reliable time series foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实交通预测需应对结构与观测不确定性，而现有模型常忽略此问题，且强耦合时空建模导致复杂度高、模块性差。

Method: 提出UniST-Pred框架：先解耦时间序列建模与空间表征学习，再通过自适应表征级融合集成二者；基于MATSim构建含严重网络断连的仿真数据集进行鲁棒性评估。

Result: 在标准交通数据集和自建仿真数据集上均达到与主流模型相当的预测性能，同时模型更轻量、表征更具可解释性。

Conclusion: 解耦+自适应融合的设计可在保证预测精度的同时提升鲁棒性、可解释性与模块性，为实际部署提供更可靠的时空预测方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is a core component of intelligent transportation systems, supporting various downstream tasks such as signal control and network-level traffic management. In real-world deployments, forecasting models must operate under structural and observational uncertainties, conditions that are rarely considered in model design. Recent approaches achieve strong short-term predictive performance by tightly coupling spatial and temporal modeling, often at the cost of increased complexity and limited modularity. In contrast, efficient time-series models capture long-range temporal dependencies without relying on explicit network structure. We propose UniST-Pred, a unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that first decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, then integrates both through adaptive representation-level fusion. To assess robustness of the proposed approach, we construct a dataset based on an agent-based, microscopic traffic simulator (MATSim) and evaluate UniST-Pred under severe network disconnection scenarios. Additionally, we benchmark UniST-Pred on standard traffic prediction datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against existing well-established models despite a lightweight design. The results illustrate that UniST-Pred maintains strong predictive performance across both real-world and simulated datasets, while also yielding interpretable spatio-temporal representations under infrastructure disruptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的位置编码策略——随机浮点采样（RFS），通过在训练中使用随机连续值而非固定离散索引，显著提升了语言模型在未见长度输入上的泛化能力，并可无缝集成到多种主流位置编码方法中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在面对超出预训练或微调阶段所见长度的输入时性能下降的问题，即长度泛化问题。

Method: 提出随机浮点采样（RFS）位置编码策略：在训练时为每个token随机采样连续浮点数作为位置索引，而非传统离散整数索引，从而缓解未见长度下的分布外（OOD）问题；该策略可兼容绝对正弦编码、RoPE、ALiBi等主流PE方法。

Result: 实验表明RFS在长度泛化任务和零样本常识推理基准上均取得优于基线的性能。

Conclusion: RFS是一种简单、通用且有效的位置编码改进策略，能显著增强模型对未见序列长度的泛化能力。

Abstract: Length generalization is the ability of language models to maintain performance on inputs longer than those seen during pretraining. In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful position encoding (PE) strategy, Random Float Sampling (RFS), that generalizes well to lengths unseen during pretraining or fine-tuning. In particular, instead of selecting position indices from a predefined discrete set, RFS uses randomly sampled continuous values, thereby avoiding out-of-distribution (OOD) issues on unseen lengths by exposing the model to diverse indices during training. Since assigning indices to tokens is a common and fundamental procedure in widely used PEs, the advantage of RFS can easily be incorporated into, for instance, the absolute sinusoidal encoding, RoPE, and ALiBi. Experiments corroborate its effectiveness by showing that RFS results in superior performance in length generalization tasks as well as zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向能量采集的去中心化联邦学习（DFL）框架，通过理论分析推导了其收敛界，并设计了一种仅依赖局部两跳邻居信息的去中心化策略迭代算法，以降低通信与计算开销，实现渐近最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中设备能耗高、电池易耗尽，导致运行寿命缩短和学习性能下降；传统基于集中式协调器的MDP方法难以适用于大规模去中心化网络。

Method: 1）建立能量采集下无线DFL的收敛性分析模型；2）将设备调度与功率控制建模为多智能体MDP；3）提出一种仅利用两跳邻域局部状态信息的完全去中心化策略迭代算法；4）提供该算法的渐近最优性理论证明。

Conclusion: 能量采集可支撑可持续的去中心化联邦学习；所提出的去中心化策略迭代算法在无全局信息前提下仍能实现高性能与低开销，为大规模边缘智能提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables edge devices to collaboratively train models through local training and fully decentralized device-to-device (D2D) model exchanges. However, these energy-intensive operations often rapidly deplete limited device batteries, reducing their operational lifetime and degrading the learning performance. To address this limitation, we apply energy harvesting technique to DFL systems, allowing edge devices to extract ambient energy and operate sustainably. We first derive the convergence bound for wireless DFL with energy harvesting, showing that the convergence is influenced by partial device participation and transmission packet drops, both of which further depend on the available energy supply. To accelerate convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP). Traditional MDP algorithms (e.g., value or policy iteration) require a centralized coordinator with access to all device states and exhibit exponential complexity in the number of devices, making them impractical for large-scale decentralized networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a fully decentralized policy iteration algorithm that leverages only local state information from two-hop neighboring devices, thereby substantially reducing both communication overhead and computational complexity. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed decentralized algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

*Yaqian Zhang,Bernhard Pfahringer,Eibe Frank,Albert Bifet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习视角的分类优化方法EPG，并进一步设计了自适应熵退火策略aEPG，以缓解大视觉模型在类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，显著优于传统交叉熵损失方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练视觉模型在类增量学习中易发生灾难性遗忘；现有参数高效微调（PEFT）方法多仍使用交叉熵（CE）损失，而CE仅为0-1损失的代理目标，非最优。

Method: 将分类建模为单步马尔可夫决策过程，推导出直接最小化误分类错误的期望策略梯度（EPG）方法；分析CE与EPG的关系，提出自适应熵退火（aEPG）策略，实现从探索性（CE样）到利用性（EPG样）学习的平滑过渡；并系统评估多种熵正则化方法对模型适应能力的影响。

Result: aEPG在多个基准数据集及不同PEFT模块上均显著优于CE基线；实验证明降低输出预测分布的熵有助于提升预训练视觉模型的增量适应能力。

Conclusion: 直接优化0-1损失（通过EPG）比使用CE更利于类增量适应；熵控制是关键调节因素，aEPG提供了一种有效且通用的训练策略。

Abstract: Despite their success, large pretrained vision models remain vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting when adapted to new tasks in class-incremental settings. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) alleviates this by restricting trainable parameters, yet most approaches still rely on cross-entropy (CE) loss, a surrogate for the 0-1 loss, to learn from new data. We revisit this choice and revive the true objective (0-1 loss) through a reinforcement learning perspective. By formulating classification as a one-step Markov Decision Process, we derive an Expected Policy Gradient (EPG) method that directly minimizes misclassification error with a low-variance gradient estimation. Our analysis shows that CE can be interpreted as EPG with an additional sample-weighting mechanism: CE encourages exploration by emphasizing low-confidence samples, while EPG prioritizes high-confidence ones. Building on this insight, we propose adaptive entropy annealing (aEPG), a training strategy that transitions from exploratory (CE-like) to exploitative (EPG-like) learning. aEPG-based methods outperform CE-based methods across diverse benchmarks and with various PEFT modules. More broadly, we evaluate various entropy regularization methods and demonstrate that lower entropy of the output prediction distribution enhances adaptation in pretrained vision models.

TL;DR: 本文研究无限维希尔伯特空间中的神经最优传输问题，指出半对偶神经OT在非正则情形下易产生虚假解，并提出基于布朗运动的高斯平滑策略以解决该问题，理论证明其在正则源测度下具有良好适定性并能恢复唯一Monge映射，实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-dual Neural OT在非正则设置下易生成无法准确刻画目标分布的虚假解，需从理论和方法上加以改进。

Method: 引入正则测度框架分析虚假解成因，并基于布朗运动设计高斯平滑策略扩展半对偶框架；理论上证明在正则源测度下问题适定且可恢复唯一Monge映射，并刻画平滑后测度的正则性与协方差算子核的关系。

Result: 理论证明了平滑后公式在正则源测度下的适定性和Monge映射唯一性，并给出平滑有效性严格依赖于协方差算子核的尖锐刻画；实验表明该方法在合成函数数据和时间序列数据上有效抑制虚假解且优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 高斯平滑策略可有效解决无限维神经最优传输中的虚假解问题，其成功关键在于协方差算子的核结构，为无限维分布匹配提供了更鲁棒的理论与实践基础。

Abstract: We study Neural Optimal Transport in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In non-regular settings, Semi-dual Neural OT often generates spurious solutions that fail to accurately capture target distributions. We analytically characterize this spurious solution problem using the framework of regular measures, which generalize Lebesgue absolute continuity in finite dimensions. To resolve ill-posedness, we extend the semi-dual framework via a Gaussian smoothing strategy based on Brownian motion. Our primary theoretical contribution proves that under a regular source measure, the formulation is well-posed and recovers a unique Monge map. Furthermore, we establish a sharp characterization for the regularity of smoothed measures, proving that the success of smoothing depends strictly on the kernel of the covariance operator. Empirical results on synthetic functional data and time-series datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively suppresses spurious solutions and outperforms existing baselines.

Motivation: 预测同时穿过和绕过多孔体的流动具有挑战性，因其涉及流体区与多孔区的耦合物理机制，且需对多种几何形状和边界条件具备泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统评估了PIPN/PI-GANO在多孔体‘穿透+绕流’联合建模中的能力，表明其有望加速无需逐几何重训练的设计分析。

Abstract: Predicting flows that occur both through and around porous bodies is challenging due to coupled physics across fluid and porous regions and the need to generalize across diverse geometries and boundary conditions. We address this problem using two Physics Informed learning approaches: Physics Informed PointNets (PIPN) and Physics Informed Geometry Aware Neural Operator (P-IGANO). We enforce the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in the free-flow region and a Darcy Forchheimer extension in the porous region within a unified loss and condition the networks on geometry and material parameters. Datasets are generated with OpenFOAM on 2D ducts containing porous obstacles and on 3D windbreak scenarios with tree canopies and buildings. We first verify the pipeline via the method of manufactured solutions, then assess generalization to unseen shapes, and for PI-GANO, to variable boundary conditions and parameter settings. The results show consistently low velocity and pressure errors in both seen and unseen cases, with accurate reproduction of the wake structures. Performance degrades primarily near sharp interfaces and in regions with large gradients. Overall, the study provides a first systematic evaluation of PIPN/PI-GANO for simultaneous through-and-around porous flows and shows their potential to accelerate design studies without retraining per geometry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过合成数据和真实数据实验，发现稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在特征恢复和可解释性任务中表现不佳，其效果与随机基线相当，质疑了当前SAEs能否可靠分解神经网络内部机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管稀疏自编码器（SAEs）被寄予厚望用于解释神经网络，但越来越多的下游任务负面结果引发对其是否真正恢复有意义特征的怀疑，亟需直接评估其核心能力。

Method: 1）在具有已知真实特征的合成数据上评估SAEs的特征恢复率与重构性能；2）在真实模型激活上设计三类随机方向或随机激活模式的基线方法，并与多种SAE架构在可解释性、稀疏探测和因果编辑等指标上对比。

Result: 在合成数据中，SAEs仅恢复9%的真实特征（尽管解释方差达71%）；在真实数据中，随机基线在可解释性（0.87 vs 0.90）、稀疏探测（0.69 vs 0.72）和因果编辑（0.73 vs 0.72）上均与SAEs相当。

Conclusion: 当前SAEs未能可靠分解神经网络的内部机制，其可解释性收益可能被高估，需重新审视其理论基础与评估范式。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for interpreting neural networks by decomposing their activations into sparse sets of human-interpretable features. Recent work has introduced multiple SAE variants and successfully scaled them to frontier models. Despite much excitement, a growing number of negative results in downstream tasks casts doubt on whether SAEs recover meaningful features. To directly investigate this, we perform two complementary evaluations. On a synthetic setup with known ground-truth features, we demonstrate that SAEs recover only $9\%$ of true features despite achieving $71\%$ explained variance, showing that they fail at their core task even when reconstruction is strong. To evaluate SAEs on real activations, we introduce three baselines that constrain SAE feature directions or their activation patterns to random values. Through extensive experiments across multiple SAE architectures, we show that our baselines match fully-trained SAEs in interpretability (0.87 vs 0.90), sparse probing (0.69 vs 0.72), and causal editing (0.73 vs 0.72). Together, these results suggest that SAEs in their current state do not reliably decompose models' internal mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有激活引导方法依赖离线分布监督和离散掩码，导致干预脆弱；同时高幅值激活可能主导全局引导方向，影响语义质量。

Method: 提出ROAST方法，包含ROC（Rollout-based On-distribution Consensus）估计引导方向、Continuous Soft Scaling（CSS）替代硬稀疏化、Grouped Mean Normalization平衡样本贡献。

Result: 在0.6B至32B规模模型上显著提升多项任务性能（如Qwen3-0.6B在GSM8K上+9.7%，GLM4-32B在TruthfulQA上+12.1%），且CSS更优地保留激活能量。

Conclusion: ROAST通过在分布内估计与连续平滑归一化，实现了更鲁棒、高效的激活引导，为LLM推理控制提供了新范式。

Abstract: Activation steering provides parameter-efficient control over large language models (LLMs) at inference time, but many methods rely on off-distribution supervision and discrete masking, leading to brittle interventions. We propose ROAST (Rollout-based On-distribution Activation Steering Technique), which estimates steering directions from the model's own on-distribution rollouts via ROC and avoids hard sparsification via Continuous Soft Scaling (CSS) and Grouped Mean Normalization. Our empirical analysis reveals that while activation magnitude correlates moderately with directional consistency, the variance in magnitude is significant and often disproportionate to semantic quality. This suggests that high-magnitude activations risk dominating the global steering direction if not properly normalized. To address this, ROAST employs grouped normalization to balance contributions across samples, ensuring a more robust estimation of the consensus steering direction. Across models (0.6B to 32B), ROAST consistently improves performance on diverse tasks (e.g., +9.7% on GSM8K for Qwen3-0.6B and +12.1% on TruthfulQA for GLM4-32B), and analyses show that CSS better preserves activation energy.

### [523] [A Penalty Approach for Differentiation Through Black-Box Quadratic Programming Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14154)
*Yuxuan Linghu,Zhiyuan Liu,Qi Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出dXPP，一种基于惩罚的QP微分框架，解耦QP求解与微分过程，在前向传递中兼容任意黑盒QP求解器，在反向传递中通过隐式微分处理平滑近似惩罚问题，仅需求解更小的线性系统，显著提升计算效率和数值鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于KKT系统的QP微分方法在大规模问题上存在计算代价高、数值鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 提出dXPP框架：前向传递使用任意黑盒QP求解器；反向传递将解映射到平滑近似惩罚问题，并对其隐式微分，仅需求解关于原始变量的小规模线性系统。

Result: 在随机QP、大规模稀疏投影及多周期投资组合优化等任务上验证，dXPP在大规模问题上显著快于KKT方法，且保持竞争力。

Conclusion: dXPP通过解耦求解与微分、避免显式KKT微分，提升了不同iable优化中QP微分的效率与鲁棒性，适用于大规模场景。

Abstract: Differentiating through the solution of a quadratic program (QP) is a central problem in differentiable optimization. Most existing approaches differentiate through the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) system, but their computational cost and numerical robustness can degrade at scale. To address these limitations, we propose dXPP, a penalty-based differentiation framework that decouples QP solving from differentiation. In the solving step (forward pass), dXPP is solver-agnostic and can leverage any black-box QP solver. In the differentiation step (backward pass), we map the solution to a smooth approximate penalty problem and implicitly differentiate through it, requiring only the solution of a much smaller linear system in the primal variables. This approach bypasses the difficulties inherent in explicit KKT differentiation and significantly improves computational efficiency and robustness. We evaluate dXPP on various tasks, including randomly generated QPs, large-scale sparse projection problems, and a real-world multi-period portfolio optimization task. Empirical results demonstrate that dXPP is competitive with KKT-based differentiation methods and achieves substantial speedups on large-scale problems.

### [524] [Synergistic Intra- and Cross-Layer Regularization Losses for MoE Expert Specialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14159)
*Rizhen Hu,Yuan Cao,Boao Kong,Mou Sun,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出两种即插即用的正则化损失函数，用于提升稀疏Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）模型中专家的专业化程度和路由效率，无需修改模型或路由器结构；其中，层内专业化损失降低专家激活相似性，跨层耦合损失增强相邻层间专家路径一致性，二者均与现有负载均衡损失正交且兼容多种MoE架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏MoE模型存在专家重叠问题（表征冗余与路由模糊），导致模型容量严重未被充分利用；现有架构改进（如DeepSeekMoE）需大幅结构调整且仅依赖层内信号，缺乏轻量、通用、跨层协同的优化方案。

Method: 提出两个插件式正则化损失：1）层内专业化损失——惩罚同一token下各专家SwiGLU激活间的余弦相似度；2）跨层耦合损失——最大化相邻层联合Top-k路由概率，构建深度一致的专家通路；二者均不改变原有路由器或模型结构，可作为Megatron-LM模块即插即用。

Result: 在预训练、微调及零样本评测中均取得稳定任务性能提升；专家专业化程度提高、路由熵降低；推理更稳定高效，专家路径一致性增强。

Conclusion: 所提正则化方法是一种轻量、通用、正交于现有MoE训练目标的有效手段，显著缓解专家重叠问题，在不增加架构复杂性的前提下提升MoE模型容量利用率与推理效率。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale Transformers efficiently but suffer from expert overlap -- redundant representations across experts and routing ambiguity, resulting in severely underutilized model capacity. While architectural solutions like DeepSeekMoE promote specialization, they require substantial structural modifications and rely solely on intra-layer signals. In this paper, we propose two plug-and-play regularization losses that enhance MoE specialization and routing efficiency without modifying router or model architectures. First, an intra-layer specialization loss penalizes cosine similarity between experts' SwiGLU activations on identical tokens, encouraging experts to specialize in complementary knowledge. Second, a cross-layer coupling loss maximizes joint Top-$k$ routing probabilities across adjacent layers, establishing coherent expert pathways through network depth while reinforcing intra-layer expert specialization. Both losses are orthogonal to the standard load-balancing loss and compatible with both the shared-expert architecture in DeepSeekMoE and vanilla top-$k$ MoE architectures. We implement both losses as a drop-in Megatron-LM module. Extensive experiments across pre-training, fine-tuning, and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate consistent task gains, higher expert specialization, and lower-entropy routing; together, these improvements translate into faster inference via more stable expert pathways.

### [525] [When Benchmarks Lie: Evaluating Malicious Prompt Classifiers Under True Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14161)
*Max Fomin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Leave-One-Dataset-Out（LODO）评估协议，揭示当前提示攻击检测方法在跨数据集泛化上的严重高估问题，并通过稀疏自编码器分析发现大量特征依赖数据集捷径而非语义；实验表明主流防护模型对间接攻击和工具注入检测能力薄弱，同时开源了新基准与评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示注入与越狱攻击检测方法在评估和实际部署中存在根本缺陷：训练测试同源导致泛化能力被高估，且缺乏对代理式（agentic）场景下复杂攻击（如间接注入、工具输出污染）的鲁棒检测能力。

Method: 构建覆盖18个数据集的多样化提示攻击基准；提出LODO评估范式；利用Sparse Auto-Encoder（SAE）分析分类器特征的数据集依赖性；系统评测PromptGuard 2、LlamaGuard及LLM-as-judge三类主流防护方案在各类攻击下的表现。

Result: LODO评估显示标准同源划分使AUC平均虚高8.4个百分点，单数据集准确率差距达1%–25%；28%的关键特征为数据集捷径；所有方法对间接攻击检测率仅7–37%，PromptGuard 2与LlamaGuard无法处理工具注入；LODO稳定的SAE特征可提升解释可靠性。

Conclusion: LODO应成为提示攻击检测研究的标准评估协议；需摒弃数据集特定捷径特征，转向语义鲁棒的检测机制；现有生产级防护在真实代理场景中存在严重盲区。

Abstract: Detecting prompt injection and jailbreak attacks is critical for deploying LLM-based agents safely. As agents increasingly process untrusted data from emails, documents, tool outputs, and external APIs, robust attack detection becomes essential. Yet current evaluation practices and production systems have fundamental limitations. We present a comprehensive analysis using a diverse benchmark of 18 datasets spanning harmful requests, jailbreaks, indirect prompt injections, and extraction attacks. We propose Leave-One-Dataset-Out (LODO) evaluation to measure true out-of-distribution generalization, revealing that the standard practice of train-test splits from the same dataset sources severely overestimates performance: aggregate metrics show an 8.4 percentage point AUC inflation, but per-dataset gaps range from 1% to 25% accuracy-exposing heterogeneous failure modes. To understand why classifiers fail to generalize, we analyze Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE) feature coefficients across LODO folds, finding that 28% of top features are dataset-dependent shortcuts whose class signal depends on specific dataset compositions rather than semantic content. We systematically compare production guardrails (PromptGuard 2, LlamaGuard) and LLM-as-judge approaches on our benchmark, finding all three fail on indirect attacks targeting agents (7-37% detection) and that PromptGuard 2 and LlamaGuard cannot evaluate agentic tool injection due to architectural limitations. Finally, we show that LODO-stable SAE features provide more reliable explanations for classifier decisions by filtering dataset artifacts. We release our evaluation framework at https://github.com/maxf-zn/prompt-mining to establish LODO as the appropriate protocol for prompt attack detection research.

*Yiran Guo,Zhongjian Qiao,Yingqi Xie,Jie Liu,Dan Ye,Ruiqing Zhang,Shuang Qiu,Lijie Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Deep Dense Exploration (DDE)策略及其实现DEEP-GRPO，聚焦于失败轨迹中深层且可恢复的状态（pivots）进行密集采样，以提升大语言模型在强化学习中的探索效率，尤其在数学推理任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习探索方法（如GRPO和树方法）在大语言模型中存在采样不均、忽略深层错误状态或稀释有效采样资源等问题，难以在有限预算下发现高质量自然语言轨迹。

Method: 提出DDE策略，核心是识别失败轨迹中的深层可恢复状态（pivots）；DEEP-GRPO实现该策略，包含：(1)轻量级数据驱动效用函数自动权衡可恢复性与深度；(2)在各pivot处局部密集重采样；(3)双流优化目标分离全局策略更新与局部纠偏。

Result: 在数学推理基准上，DEEP-GRPO持续超越GRPO、各类树方法及其他强基线。

Conclusion: 聚焦深层可恢复状态的密集探索是一种更高效、稳定的大语言模型强化学习探索范式。

Abstract: Effective exploration is a key challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models: discovering high-quality trajectories within a limited sampling budget from the vast natural language sequence space. Existing methods face notable limitations: GRPO samples exclusively from the root, saturating high-probability trajectories while leaving deep, error-prone states under-explored. Tree-based methods blindly disperse budgets across trivial or unrecoverable states, causing sampling dilution that fails to uncover rare correct suffixes and destabilizes local baselines. To address this, we propose Deep Dense Exploration (DDE), a strategy that focuses exploration on $\textit{pivots}$-deep, recoverable states within unsuccessful trajectories. We instantiate DDE with DEEP-GRPO, which introduces three key innovations: (1) a lightweight data-driven utility function that automatically balances recoverability and depth bias to identify pivot states; (2) local dense resampling at each pivot to increase the probability of discovering correct subsequent trajectories; and (3) a dual-stream optimization objective that decouples global policy learning from local corrective updates. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO, tree-based methods, and other strong baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了TS-Haystack长时序检索基准，揭示了现有时间序列语言模型（TSLM）在长上下文检索任务中因忽略时间粒度而导致的性能下降问题，指出压缩虽利于分类但损害局部事件检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TSLM在短序列上训练和评估，难以应对现实世界中长达数百万点的传感器时序流，缺乏能反映严格计算约束下精确时间定位能力的基准。

Method: 构建TS-Haystack基准，包含10类任务、4大类别，通过可控‘针插入’方式将短活动片段嵌入长加速度计记录中，系统评估从秒级到2小时级上下文长度下的检索性能；对比多种模型与编码策略，分析分类与检索行为差异。

Result: 学习型潜在压缩在高达176×压缩比下可维持或提升分类准确率，但检索性能随上下文增长而持续下降，表明时间局部信息丢失；分类与检索表现呈现一致且任务相关的分化。

Conclusion: 需设计能解耦序列长度与计算复杂度、同时保持时间保真度的新型架构，以支持长时序下的高效精准检索。

Abstract: Time Series Language Models (TSLMs) are emerging as unified models for reasoning over continuous signals in natural language. However, long-context retrieval remains a major limitation: existing models are typically trained and evaluated on short sequences, while real-world time-series sensor streams can span millions of datapoints. This mismatch requires precise temporal localization under strict computational constraints, a regime that is not captured by current benchmarks. We introduce TS-Haystack, a long-context temporal retrieval benchmark comprising ten task types across four categories: direct retrieval, temporal reasoning, multi-step reasoning and contextual anomaly. The benchmark uses controlled needle insertion by embedding short activity bouts into longer longitudinal accelerometer recordings, enabling systematic evaluation across context lengths ranging from seconds to 2 hours per sample. We hypothesize that existing TSLM time series encoders overlook temporal granularity as context length increases, creating a task-dependent effect: compression aids classification but impairs retrieval of localized events. Across multiple model and encoding strategies, we observe a consistent divergence between classification and retrieval behavior. Learned latent compression preserves or improves classification accuracy at compression ratios up to 176$\times$, but retrieval performance degrades with context length, incurring in the loss of temporally localized information. These results highlight the importance of architectural designs that decouple sequence length from computational complexity while preserving temporal fidelity.

*Jinbo Wang,Binghui Li,Zhanpeng Zhou,Mingze Wang,Yuxuan Sun,Jiaqi Zhang,Xunliang Cai,Lei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出基于功能缩放律（FSL）框架分析批量大小调度（BSS），发现最优调度策略随任务难度变化：易任务持续增大批量，难任务则前期小批量、后期突增至大批量；该‘晚期切换’现象源于‘快速追赶效应’——即切换后损失迅速对齐大批量轨迹，由梯度噪声快速遗忘所致；实验证明该策略在大规模语言模型预训练中显著降低数据消耗且提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批量大小调度（BSS）在大模型训练中至关重要，但其理论基础薄弱，缺乏对最优调度结构及其与任务难度关系的系统性理解。

Method: 基于Li等（2025a）提出的功能缩放律（FSL）框架，理论推导最优BSS结构，引入并建模‘快速追赶效应’，结合梯度噪声遗忘动力学进行机制解释，并通过多规模LLM预训练实验（Dense/MoE，1.1B参数、1T tokens）验证。

Result: 理论揭示最优BSS结构依赖任务难度：易任务单调增大批量，难任务呈现晚期切换模式；发现并解释‘快速追赶效应’，证明晚期切换可大幅减少数据消耗而不损性能；实验表明晚期切换策略在各类LLM设置下均优于恒定及早期切换基线。

Conclusion: FSL为BSS提供了坚实的理论基础；晚期切换是一种高效、鲁棒且数据经济的批量调度范式，尤其适用于困难任务的大模型训练。

Abstract: Batch size scheduling (BSS) plays a critical role in large-scale deep learning training, influencing both optimization dynamics and computational efficiency. Yet, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that the functional scaling law (FSL) framework introduced in Li et al. (2025a) provides a principled lens for analyzing BSS. Specifically, we characterize the optimal BSS under a fixed data budget and show that its structure depends sharply on task difficulty. For easy tasks, optimal schedules keep increasing batch size throughout. In contrast, for hard tasks, the optimal schedule maintains small batch sizes for most of training and switches to large batches only in a late stage. To explain the emergence of late switching, we uncover a dynamical mechanism -- the fast catch-up effect -- which also manifests in large language model (LLM) pretraining. After switching from small to large batches, the loss rapidly aligns with the constant large-batch trajectory. Using FSL, we show that this effect stems from rapid forgetting of accumulated gradient noise, with the catch-up speed determined by task difficulty. Crucially, this effect implies that large batches can be safely deferred to late training without sacrificing performance, while substantially reducing data consumption. Finally, extensive LLM pretraining experiments -- covering both Dense and MoE architectures with up to 1.1B parameters and 1T tokens -- validate our theoretical predictions. Across all settings, late-switch schedules consistently outperform constant-batch and early-switch baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出MAGE方法，利用块扩散LLM中首次All-[MASK]去噪步骤的精确注意力计算，实现训练免费的稀疏去噪，在长上下文任务中以更少KV缓存预算实现近无损精度和3-4倍端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 块扩散LLM因KV缓存导致长上下文下内存访问成为主要瓶颈；现有为自回归LLM设计的动态稀疏注意力方法在块扩散中效果差，因其依赖近似重要性估计。

Method: 利用块扩散中首次All-[MASK]去噪步骤可精确预测关键KV条目和预算需求的特性，MAGE执行单次精确注意力计算并复用于后续训练免费的稀疏去噪；辅以轻量微调强化[MASK]-引导模式。

Result: 在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack等长上下文基准上，MAGE以显著降低的KV预算实现近无损精度，并获得3–4倍端到端加速，持续优于自回归导向的稀疏注意力基线；轻量微调仅需单张H100 GPU数小时即可适配1.5B和7B模型。

Conclusion: MAGE揭示并利用了块扩散LLM中独特的结构先验，为高效长上下文生成提供了无需训练、高精度、高吞吐的新范式。

Abstract: Block diffusion LLMs are emerging as a promising next paradigm for language generation, but their use of KV caching makes memory access a dominant bottleneck in long-context settings. While dynamic sparse attention has been actively explored, existing methods designed for autoregressive LLMs rely on approximate importance estimation and perform poorly when adapted to block diffusion. This work identifies a key opportunity unique to block diffusion: attention at the first All-[MASK] denoising step reliably predicts important KV entries and budget requirements, enabling MAGE to perform a single exact attention pass per block and reuse it for training-free sparse denoising. Across long-context benchmarks including LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack, MAGE achieves near-lossless accuracy with a fraction of the KV budget while delivering up to 3-4x end-to-end speedup, consistently outperforming AR-oriented sparse attention baselines. A lightweight fine-tuning strategy further strengthens [MASK]-guided patterns with minimal cost, requiring only a few hours of training on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU for both 1.5B and 7B models.

Motivation: 传统多任务学习易受无关或噪声任务影响导致负迁移，需一种能自适应识别任务相关性并稳健共享知识的方法。

Method: 提出Robust Multi-Task Boosting using Clustering and Local Ensembling（RMB-CLE），利用跨任务预测误差推导任务相似性，进行自适应凝聚聚类，并在每个簇内构建局部集成模型。

Result: 在合成数据中准确恢复真实任务簇，在多种真实与合成基准上持续超越多任务、单任务及池化集成方法。

Conclusion: RMB-CLE不仅是聚类与提升法的简单组合，而是一个具理论基础、通用且可扩展的鲁棒多任务学习新范式。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) aims to boost predictive performance by sharing information across related tasks, yet conventional methods often suffer from negative transfer when unrelated or noisy tasks are forced to share representations. We propose Robust Multi-Task Boosting using Clustering and Local Ensembling (RMB-CLE), a principled MTL framework that integrates error-based task clustering with local ensembling. Unlike prior work that assumes fixed clusters or hand-crafted similarity metrics, RMB-CLE derives inter-task similarity directly from cross-task errors, which admit a risk decomposition into functional mismatch and irreducible noise, providing a theoretically grounded mechanism to prevent negative transfer. Tasks are grouped adaptively via agglomerative clustering, and within each cluster, a local ensemble enables robust knowledge sharing while preserving task-specific patterns. Experiments show that RMB-CLE recovers ground-truth clusters in synthetic data and consistently outperforms multi-task, single-task, and pooling-based ensemble methods across diverse real-world and synthetic benchmarks. These results demonstrate that RMB-CLE is not merely a combination of clustering and boosting but a general and scalable framework that establishes a new basis for robust multi-task learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial workflows, but evaluation practice has not kept up. Finance-specific biases can inflate performance, contaminate backtests, and make reported results useless for any deployment claim. We identify five recurring biases in financial LLM applications. They include look-ahead bias, survivorship bias, narrative bias, objective bias, and cost bias. These biases break financial tasks in distinct ways and they often compound to create an illusion of validity. We reviewed 164 papers from 2023 to 2025 and found that no single bias is discussed in more than 28 percent of studies. This position paper argues that bias in financial LLM systems requires explicit attention and that structural validity should be enforced before any result is used to support a deployment claim. We propose a Structural Validity Framework and an evaluation checklist with minimal requirements for bias diagnosis and future system design.

TL;DR: 本文提出MAD（Multi-Agent Debating）框架，通过多智能体辩论机制整合异构异常检测器，在表格数据异常检测中提升鲁棒性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测方法多依赖单一模型或静态集成，难以应对分布偏移、缺失值和罕见异常等挑战；而不同模型家族常存在分歧，该分歧本身蕴含重要信息。

Method: MAD框架包含多个ML异常检测器作为智能体（输出归一化异常分、置信度和结构化证据），每个配以LLM批评家；协调器将各智能体消息转化为有界损失，并通过指数梯度规则动态调整各智能体影响力，最终合成辩论异常分与可审计辩论轨迹。

Result: 在多个表格异常检测基准上，MAD相较基线方法展现出更强的鲁棒性，并提供更清晰的模型分歧追溯轨迹；理论层面给出了合成损失的遗憾界保证，并支持共形校准以控制假阳性率。

Conclusion: MAD将模型分歧显式建模为关键信号，提供统一、可扩展、可验证的多智能体异常检测新范式，兼具理论保障与实践有效性。

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection is often handled by single detectors or static ensembles, even though strong performance on tabular data typically comes from heterogeneous model families (e.g., tree ensembles, deep tabular networks, and tabular foundation models) that frequently disagree under distribution shift, missingness, and rare-anomaly regimes. We propose MAD, a Multi-Agent Debating framework that treats this disagreement as a first-class signal and resolves it through a mathematically grounded coordination layer. Each agent is a machine learning (ML)-based detector that produces a normalized anomaly score, confidence, and structured evidence, augmented by a large language model (LLM)-based critic. A coordinator converts these messages into bounded per-agent losses and updates agent influence via an exponentiated-gradient rule, yielding both a final debated anomaly score and an auditable debate trace. MAD is a unified agentic framework that can recover existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts gating and learning-with-expert-advice aggregation, by restricting the message space and synthesis operator. We establish regret guarantees for the synthesized losses and show how conformal calibration can wrap the debated score to control false positives under exchangeability. Experiments on diverse tabular anomaly benchmarks show improved robustness over baselines and clearer traces of model disagreement

Conclusion: 迁移学习可有效支撑大规模家庭热水需求预测，兼顾准确性与可扩展性，适用于云连接热泵系统。

Abstract: With the rapid increase in residential heat pump (HP) installations, optimizing hot water production in households is essential, yet it faces major technical and scalability challenges. Adapting production to actual household needs requires accurate forecasting of hot water demand to ensure comfort and, most importantly, to reduce energy waste. However, the conventional approach of training separate machine learning models for each household becomes computationally expensive at scale, particularly in cloud-connected HP deployments.
  This study introduces DELTAiF, a transfer learning (TL) based framework that provides scalable and accurate prediction of household hot water consumption. By predicting large hot water usage events, such as showers, DELTAiF enables adaptive yet scalable hot water production at the household level. DELTAiF leverages learned knowledge from a representative household and fine-tunes it across others, eliminating the need to train separate machine learning models for each HP installation. This approach reduces overall training time by approximately 67 percent while maintaining high predictive accuracy values between 0.874 and 0.991, and mean absolute percentage error values between 0.001 and 0.017. The results show that TL is particularly effective when the source household exhibits regular consumption patterns, enabling hot water demand forecasting at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法（如VCReg）通过正则化一阶和二阶特征统计量来逼近最大熵，但无法充分实现；高维下显式信息最大化受维度灾难限制。

Method: 提出Radial-VCReg：在VCReg框架中新增径向高斯化损失，强制特征向量模长服从卡方分布（高维高斯分布的固有性质），并从理论证明其能将更广类分布推向正态性。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上验证了Radial-VCReg可系统性降低高阶依赖、增强表征多样性与信息量，并持续提升下游性能。

Conclusion: 径向高斯化是提升自监督表征信息量的有效途径，Radial-VCReg比VCReg具有更强的分布校正能力与泛化性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning aims to learn maximally informative representations, but explicit information maximization is hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Existing methods like VCReg address this by regularizing first and second-order feature statistics, which cannot fully achieve maximum entropy. We propose Radial-VCReg, which augments VCReg with a radial Gaussianization loss that aligns feature norms with the Chi distribution-a defining property of high-dimensional Gaussians. We prove that Radial-VCReg transforms a broader class of distributions towards normality compared to VCReg and show on synthetic and real-world datasets that it consistently improves performance by reducing higher-order dependencies and promoting more diverse and informative representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用基于Transformer的语言模型从非结构化文本中进行因果推断的框架，并验证了其在人群、群体和个体层面与结构化数据所得因果估计的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果推断严重依赖结构化数据，但在许多现实场景中，这类数据不完整或不可用。

Method: 构建基于Transformer语言模型的框架，从非结构化文本中提取因果关系，并在人群、群体和个体层面与结构化数据的因果估计进行对比验证。

Result: 文本-derived因果估计与结构化数据所得结果一致，证明了非结构化文本可用于可靠因果推断。

Conclusion: 该方法拓展了因果推断的应用范围，使仅拥有文本数据的业务场景也能实现数据驱动的决策。

Abstract: Causal inference, a critical tool for informing business decisions, traditionally relies heavily on structured data. However, in many real-world scenarios, such data can be incomplete or unavailable. This paper presents a framework that leverages transformer-based language models to perform causal inference using unstructured text. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by comparing causal estimates derived from unstructured text against those obtained from structured data across population, group, and individual levels. Our findings show consistent results between the two approaches, validating the potential of unstructured text in causal inference tasks. Our approach extends the applicability of causal inference methods to scenarios where only textual data is available, enabling data-driven business decision-making when structured tabular data is scarce.

*Lamine Rihani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为'反向n元输出测试'的新范式，通过在输出等价类上构建覆盖数组，并利用无梯度元启发式优化解决黑箱逆映射问题，以生成能激发目标行为特征的输入或量子电路参数，从而提升AI/ML与量子计算系统的测试覆盖率、故障检测率及验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI/ML和量子计算软件面临高维输入空间、概率性输出、行为正确性依赖可观测预测/测量结果、以及信任度、公平性、校准性、鲁棒性、错误模式等复杂质量维度交织的测试挑战。

Method: 提出反向n-wise输出测试：先在语义明确的输出空间（如置信度桶、决策边界区、公平性划分、量子测量分布、错误综合征模式）构建覆盖数组，再通过梯度无关的元启发式优化求解黑箱逆映射，合成可触发目标行为的输入或量子参数。

Result: 实现了客户中心化的预测/测量覆盖保证，显著提升ML校准/边界失效与量子错误综合征的故障检测率，增强测试套件效率，并支持自动化MLOps/量子验证流水线（含不确定性分析驱动的分区发现与覆盖漂移监控）。

Conclusion: 该范式实现了从传统输入驱动测试到输出驱动测试的数学原理性范式转换，为AI与量子软件提供统一、可扩展、可解释的可信验证框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) systems and emerging quantum computing software present unprecedented testing challenges characterized by high-dimensional/continuous input spaces, probabilistic/non-deterministic output distributions, behavioral correctness defined exclusively over observable prediction behaviors and measurement outcomes, and critical quality dimensions, trustworthiness, fairness, calibration, robustness, error syndrome patterns, that manifest through complex multi-way interactions among semantically meaningful output properties rather than deterministic input-output mappings. This paper introduces reverse n-wise output testing, a mathematically principled paradigm inversion that constructs covering arrays directly over domain-specific output equivalence classes, ML confidence calibration buckets, decision boundary regions, fairness partitions, embedding clusters, ranking stability bands, quantum measurement outcome distributions (0-dominant, 1-dominant, superposition collapse), error syndrome patterns (bit-flip, phase-flip, correlated errors), then solves the computationally challenging black-box inverse mapping problem via gradient-free metaheuristic optimization to synthesize input feature configurations or quantum circuit parameters capable of eliciting targeted behavioral signatures from opaque models. The framework delivers synergistic benefits across both domains: explicit customer-centric prediction/measurement coverage guarantees, substantial improvements in fault detection rates for ML calibration/boundary failures and quantum error syndromes, enhanced test suite efficiency, and structured MLOps/quantum validation pipelines with automated partition discovery from uncertainty analysis and coverage drift monitoring.

*Ruomeng Ding,Tianwei Gao,Thomas P. Zollo,Eitan Bachmat,Richard Zemel,Zhun Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应群体信息采集框架，结合大语言模型的信息增益评估与异构图神经网络的响应补全和参与者选择，在有限预算下显著提升群体层面响应预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信息采集方法通常固定受访者池、不适应性选择受访者，也未利用人口结构处理不完整响应；而实际中存在查询成本、数据缺失和群体结构等现实约束。

Method: 提出自适应群体采集框架：（i）用大语言模型计算期望信息增益以评分候选问题；（ii）用异构图神经网络聚合已观测响应与参与者属性，补全缺失响应并指导每轮受访者选择；形成闭环查询-推断流程。

Result: 在三个真实意见数据集上，该方法在受限预算下持续提升群体响应预测性能，例如在10%受访者预算下于CES数据集获得超12%相对提升。

Conclusion: 融合LLM驱动的问题选择与图神经网络驱动的结构化响应推断，可高效利用有限资源实现高精度群体属性估计，为低成本、高鲁棒性社会调查提供了新范式。

Abstract: Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about latent group-level properties from surveys and other collective assessments requires allocating limited questioning effort under real costs and missing data. Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出KernelBlaster，一种基于记忆增强的上下文强化学习（MAIC-RL）框架，用于提升LLM驱动的CUDA代码优化智能体的搜索能力，通过构建可检索的持久化CUDA知识库，实现跨GPU架构的高效优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编译器依赖固定启发式规则，微调大语言模型成本高，而现有CUDA优化智能体缺乏对历史探索知识的有效聚合，导致采样偏差和次优解。

Method: 提出Memory-Augmented In-context Reinforcement Learning（MAIC-RL）框架KernelBlaster，构建Persistent CUDA Knowledge Base，并设计基于性能分析与文本梯度的新型智能体流程，引导LLM系统性探索高潜力优化策略。

Result: 在KernelBench三个层级上，相比PyTorch基线分别实现1.43x、2.50x和1.50x的几何平均加速；开源了含测试套件、验证组件和可复现评估流程的框架。

Conclusion: KernelBlaster通过记忆增强与强化学习结合，显著提升了LLM在跨代GPU架构下CUDA内核优化的系统性与有效性，为AI驱动的高性能计算编译优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Optimizing CUDA code across multiple generations of GPU architectures is challenging, as achieving peak performance requires an extensive exploration of an increasingly complex, hardware-specific optimization space. Traditional compilers are constrained by fixed heuristics, whereas finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be expensive. However, agentic workflows for CUDA code optimization have limited ability to aggregate knowledge from prior exploration, leading to biased sampling and suboptimal solutions. We propose KernelBlaster, a Memory-Augmented In-context Reinforcement Learning (MAIC-RL) framework designed to improve CUDA optimization search capabilities of LLM-based GPU coding agents. KernelBlaster enables agents to learn from experience and make systematically informed decisions on future tasks by accumulating knowledge into a retrievable Persistent CUDA Knowledge Base. We propose a novel profile-guided, textual-gradient-based agentic flow for CUDA generation and optimization to achieve high performance across generations of GPU architectures. KernelBlaster guides LLM agents to systematically explore high-potential optimization strategies beyond naive rewrites. Compared to the PyTorch baseline, our method achieves geometric mean speedups of 1.43x, 2.50x, and 1.50x on KernelBench Levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We release KernelBlaster as an open-source agentic framework, accompanied by a test harness, verification components, and a reproducible evaluation pipeline.

### [539] [Machine Learning as a Tool (MLAT): A Framework for Integrating Statistical ML Models as Callable Tools within LLM Agent Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14295)
*Edwin Chen,Zulekha Bibi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MLAT（Machine Learning as a Tool）的设计模式，将预训练的机器学习模型作为可调用工具集成进大语言模型（LLM）智能体工作流中，使LLM能根据上下文动态决定何时调用定量预测模型；并通过PitchCraft系统验证了该模式在销售提案自动生成中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ML推理作为静态预处理步骤的局限性，让ML模型成为LLM智能体工作流中与搜索、数据库、API等并列的一等工具，实现基于上下文的动态调用与推理。

Method: 提出MLAT框架，设计结构化输出架构，采用极小样本（70例，含合成数据）训练XGBoost定价模型，并将其封装为LLM可调用工具；构建双智能体系统（Research Agent与Draft Agent）实现端到端提案生成。

Result: XGBoost定价模型在保留集上R²=0.807，平均绝对误差3688美元；PitchCraft系统将提案生成时间从数小时缩短至10分钟以内。

Conclusion: MLAT是一种通用范式，适用于需结合定量估计与上下文推理的各类领域，拓展了LLM智能体在专业决策场景中的能力边界。

Abstract: We introduce Machine Learning as a Tool (MLAT), a design pattern in which pre-trained statistical machine learning models are exposed as callable tools within large language model (LLM) agent workflows. This allows an orchestrating agent to invoke quantitative predictions when needed and reason about their outputs in context. Unlike conventional pipelines that treat ML inference as a static preprocessing step, MLAT positions the model as a first-class tool alongside web search, database queries, and APIs, enabling the LLM to decide when and how to use it based on conversational context.
  To validate MLAT, we present PitchCraft, a pilot production system that converts discovery call recordings into professional proposals with ML-predicted pricing. The system uses two agents: a Research Agent that gathers prospect intelligence via parallel tool calls, and a Draft Agent that invokes an XGBoost pricing model as a tool call and generates a complete proposal through structured outputs. The pricing model, trained on 70 examples combining real and human-verified synthetic data, achieves R^2 = 0.807 on held-out data with a mean absolute error of 3688 USD. The system reduces proposal generation time from multiple hours to under 10 minutes.
  We describe the MLAT framework, structured output architecture, training methodology under extreme data scarcity, and sensitivity analysis demonstrating meaningful learned relationships. MLAT generalizes to domains requiring quantitative estimation combined with contextual reasoning.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized machine learning across a wide range of domains, from natural language processing to scientific computing. However, their growing deployment in high-stakes applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, healthcare, autonomous systems, and critical areas of scientific computing including climate modeling, materials discovery, drug discovery, nuclear science, and robotics, necessitates a deeper and more rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness. In this work, we critically examine the foundational question: \textitHow trustworthy are transformer models?} We evaluate their reliability through a comprehensive review of interpretability, explainability, robustness against adversarial attacks, fairness, and privacy. We systematically examine the trustworthiness of transformer-based models in safety-critical applications spanning natural language processing, computer vision, and science and engineering domains, including robotics, medicine, earth sciences, materials science, fluid dynamics, nuclear science, and automated theorem proving; highlighting high-impact areas where these architectures are central and analyzing the risks associated with their deployment. By synthesizing insights across these diverse areas, we identify recurring structural vulnerabilities, domain-specific risks, and open research challenges that limit the reliable deployment of transformers.

### [541] [Conformal Signal Temporal Logic for Robust Reinforcement Learning Control: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14322)
*Hani Beirami,M M Manjurul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信号时序逻辑（STL）与在线共形预测的“共形STL屏蔽器”，用于提升强化学习（RL）在航空航天控制中的安全性与鲁棒性；在F-16仿真平台上的实验表明，该方法在满足形式化安全约束的同时，性能接近基线，并显著优于传统规则式STL屏蔽器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升强化学习在航空航天等高风险场景下的安全性与鲁棒性，尤其在模型失配、噪声、执行器限制等压力条件下保障形式化安全约束（如STL）的运行时满足。

Method: 基于AeroBench F-16仿真平台，采用PPO算法训练控制器；将空速跟踪目标编码为STL规范；设计并实现一种结合在线共形预测的STL运行时屏蔽器（conformal STL shield），动态过滤RL动作以保障STL满足；对比PPO基线、经典规则式STL屏蔽、所提共形屏蔽三种设置。

Result: 共形STL屏蔽器在名义和严重压力场景下均能严格维持STL规范满足，同时保持接近基线的控制性能，并提供比经典规则式屏蔽更强的鲁棒性保证。

Conclusion: 将形式化时序逻辑监控与数据驱动的强化学习控制相结合，可显著提升自主飞行控制系统在复杂不确定环境中的可靠性。

Abstract: We investigate how formal temporal logic specifications can enhance the safety and robustness of reinforcement learning (RL) control in aerospace applications. Using the open source AeroBench F-16 simulation benchmark, we train a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to regulate engine throttle and track commanded airspeed. The control objective is encoded as a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) requirement to maintain airspeed within a prescribed band during the final seconds of each maneuver. To enforce this specification at run time, we introduce a conformal STL shield that filters the RL agent's actions using online conformal prediction. We compare three settings: (i) PPO baseline, (ii) PPO with a classical rule-based STL shield, and (iii) PPO with the proposed conformal shield, under both nominal conditions and a severe stress scenario involving aerodynamic model mismatch, actuator rate limits, measurement noise, and mid-episode setpoint jumps. Experiments show that the conformal shield preserves STL satisfaction while maintaining near baseline performance and providing stronger robustness guarantees than the classical shield. These results demonstrate that combining formal specification monitoring with data driven RL control can substantially improve the reliability of autonomous flight control in challenging environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出AERO方法，通过自适应rollout策略、选择性拒绝和贝叶斯后验维护，显著提升GRPO在RLVR微调中的计算效率，减少约48%训练计算量且不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO方法在所有rollout结果相同时导致归一化优势为零，丧失梯度信号并浪费计算资源。

Method: AERO改进GRPO，采用自适应rollout生成、选择性剪枝以及贝叶斯后验估计以避免零优势死区。

Result: 在三个Qwen2.5模型上，AERO在相同总rollout预算下降低约48%训练计算量，单步墙钟时间减少约45%，同时Pass@8和Avg@8持平或优于GRPO。

Conclusion: AERO是一种实用、可扩展且计算高效的RL-based LLM对齐策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a central role in large language model (LLM) post-training. Among existing approaches, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is widely used, especially for RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) fine-tuning. In GRPO, each query prompts the LLM to generate a group of rollouts with a fixed group size $N$. When all rollouts in a group share the same outcome, either all correct or all incorrect, the group-normalized advantages become zero, yielding no gradient signal and wasting fine-tuning compute. We introduce Adaptive Efficient Rollout Optimization (AERO), an enhancement of GRPO. AERO uses an adaptive rollout strategy, applies selective rejection to strategically prune rollouts, and maintains a Bayesian posterior to prevent zero-advantage dead zones. Across three model configurations (Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), AERO improves compute efficiency without sacrificing performance. Under the same total rollout budget, AERO reduces total training compute by about 48% while shortening wall-clock time per step by about 45% on average. Despite the substantial reduction in compute, AERO matches or improves Pass@8 and Avg@8 over GRPO, demonstrating a practical, scalable, and compute-efficient strategy for RL-based LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于线性时序逻辑（LTL）的多任务强化学习新方法，通过将策略条件化于有限自动机生成的布尔公式序列，并设计分层神经网络与注意力机制，显著提升了零样本任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LTL的多任务强化学习方法难以有效建模LTL规范中丰富的逻辑和时序结构，导致零样本执行新任务能力受限。

Method: 提出一种新方法：将策略条件化于任务有限自动机导出的布尔公式序列；设计分层神经网络编码公式逻辑结构；引入注意力机制使策略能推理未来子目标。

Result: 在多种复杂环境中实验表明，该方法具有更强的泛化能力和更优性能。

Conclusion: 结构化的任务表征（基于LTL自动机与布尔公式序列）结合分层编码与注意力机制，是提升多任务RL零样本泛化能力的有效途径。

Abstract: We study instruction following in multi-task reinforcement learning, where an agent must zero-shot execute novel tasks not seen during training. In this setting, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently been adopted as a powerful framework for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks. While existing approaches successfully train generalist policies, they often struggle to effectively capture the rich logical and temporal structure inherent in LTL specifications. In this work, we address these concerns with a novel approach to learn structured task representations that facilitate training and generalisation. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of Boolean formulae constructed from a finite automaton of the task. We propose a hierarchical neural architecture to encode the logical structure of these formulae, and introduce an attention mechanism that enables the policy to reason about future subgoals. Experiments in a variety of complex environments demonstrate the strong generalisation capabilities and superior performance of our approach.

Motivation: 解决模型型强化学习中因模型误差累积、单模态世界模型平均多模态动力学以及过度自信预测导致的学习偏差等问题。

Conclusion: 基于IMLE的多模态建模与不确定性感知加权机制，可有效提升模型型强化学习的稳定性与性能。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning promises strong sample efficiency but often underperforms in practice due to compounding model error, unimodal world models that average over multi-modal dynamics, and overconfident predictions that bias learning. We introduce WIMLE, a model-based method that extends Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) to the model-based RL framework to learn stochastic, multi-modal world models without iterative sampling and to estimate predictive uncertainty via ensembles and latent sampling. During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2). These results highlight the value of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable model-based RL.

Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-class online fuzzy classifier for dynamic environments. A fuzzy classifier comprises a set of fuzzy if-then rules where human users determine the antecedent fuzzy sets beforehand. In contrast, the consequent real values are determined by learning from training data. In an online framework, not all training dataset patterns are available beforehand. Instead, only a few patterns are available at a time step, and the subsequent patterns become available at the following time steps. The conventional online fuzzy classifier considered only two-class problems. This paper investigates the extension to the conventional fuzzy classifiers for multi-class problems. We evaluate the performance of the multi-class online fuzzy classifiers through numerical experiments on synthetic dynamic data and also several benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Data augmentation is one of the most widely used techniques to improve generalization in modern machine learning, often justified by its ability to promote invariance to label-irrelevant transformations. However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap.

Motivation: 现有XAI方法（如LIME和SHAP）对同一场景给出的特征重要性解释常不一致，因其对‘重要性’和‘相关性’的定义不同；需借助因果理论（必要性与充分性）来增强解释的可靠性与可信赖性。

Conclusion: 基于因果概念（必要性/充分性）的鲁棒性评估可显著提升XAI在油气勘探风险建模中的可信度与实用性。

Abstract: In geophysics, hydrocarbon prospect risking involves assessing the risks associated with hydrocarbon exploration by integrating data from various sources. Machine learning-based classifiers trained on tabular data have been recently used to make faster decisions on these prospects. The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of such models has led to the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). LIME and SHAP are two such examples of these XAI methods which try to generate explanations of a particular decision by ranking the input features in terms of importance. However, explanations of the same scenario generated by these two different explanation strategies have shown to disagree or be different, particularly for complex data. This is because the definitions of "importance" and "relevance" differ for different explanation strategies. Thus, grounding these ranked features using theoretically backed causal ideas of necessity and sufficiency can prove to be a more reliable and robust way to improve the trustworthiness of the concerned explanation strategies.We propose a unified framework to generate counterfactuals as well as quantify necessity and sufficiency and use these to perform a robustness evaluation of the explanations provided by LIME and SHAP on high dimensional structured prospect risking data. This robustness test gives us deeper insights into the models capabilities to handle erronous data and which XAI module works best in pair with which model for our dataset for hydorcarbon indication.

Conclusion: S²D是一种高效、可扩展的量化友好型微调策略，支持更大更严苛训练模型的高效部署。

Abstract: Activation outliers in large-scale transformer models pose a fundamental challenge to model quantization, creating excessively large ranges that cause severe accuracy drops during quantization. We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文研究在推理token受限条件下，不同推理模态（代码、自然语言、混合、无）对前沿大模型数学推理性能的影响，发现截断的推理链反而有害，纯代码推理更鲁棒，混合模态表现较差，且各模型鲁棒性差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理专用模型（如GPT-5.1、DeepSeek-V3.2）依赖长思维链（CoT），但推理token成本高昂；需探究在token预算受限下，不同推理模态的表现与鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一种约束框架，强制模型仅通过代码、注释、二者结合或不使用显式推理进行作答，并系统地将token预算削减至最优值的10%、30%、50%、70%；在AIME、GSM8K、HMMT等数学基准上评估GPT-5.1、Gemini 3 Flash、DeepSeek-V3.2、Grok 4.1四个前沿模型。

Result: （1）截断CoT严重损害性能（如DeepSeek-V3.2在50%预算下CoT仅17%，无推理反达53%）；（2）纯代码推理退化平缓（Gemini代码保持43–47%，注释归零）；（3）混合模态不如单一模态；（4）模型鲁棒性差异大（Grok在30%预算下保持80–90%，而GPT-5.1和DeepSeek跌至7–27%）。

Conclusion: 不完整的推理链会误导模型；部署推理专用系统时应优先选择鲁棒性强的模态（如纯代码）和模型（如Grok），并避免盲目截断CoT。

Abstract: Reasoning-specialized models like OpenAI's 5.1 and DeepSeek-V3.2 allocate substantial inference compute to extended chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, yet reasoning tokens incur significant costs. How do different reasoning modalities of code, natural language, hybrid, or none do perform under token constraints? We introduce a framework that constrains models to reason exclusively through code, comments, both, or neither, then systematically ablates token budgets to 10\%, 30\%, 50\%, and 70\% of optimal. We evaluate four frontier models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Flash, DeepSeek-V3.2, Grok 4.1) across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, GSM8K, HMMT). Our findings reveal: (1) \textbf{truncated reasoning can hurt} as DeepSeek-V3.2 achieves 53\% with no reasoning but only 17\% with truncated CoT at 50\% budget; (2) \textbf{code degrades gracefully} as Gemini's comments collapse to 0\% while code maintains 43-47\%; (3) \textbf{hybrid reasoning underperforms} single modalities; (4) \textbf{robustness is model-dependent} as Grok maintains 80-90\% at 30\% budget where OpenAI and DeepSeek collapse to 7-27\%. These results suggest incomplete reasoning chains actively mislead models, with implications for deploying reasoning-specialized systems under resource constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Kuramoto振子同步模型的新型注意力机制SSA，用以替代Transformer中的点积自注意力，具有自然稀疏性、统一的位置-语义编码能力及单步闭式计算优势，并构建了可即插即用的振荡同步网络OSN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer中自注意力机制计算复杂度高（二次方）且缺乏生物神经计算基础的问题。

Method: 提出Selective Synchronization Attention（SSA），将每个token建模为具可学习固有频率和相位的振子，注意力权重由频率依赖的耦合强度与相位锁定条件决定；基于Kuramoto模型稳态解推导出闭式同步算子；构建Oscillatory Synchronization Network（OSN）作为Transformer block的即插即用替代。

Result: SSA实现了自然稀疏（无需显式mask）、消除了对独立位置编码的需求、支持单步闭式计算；OSN在初始化时即呈现非均匀、头间多样的同步模式，展现出比标准Transformer更强的结构归纳偏置。

Conclusion: SSA为注意力机制提供了具生物合理性和计算高效性的新范式，OSN验证了其作为Transformer替代架构的可行性与优势。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern deep learning, yet its core self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic computational complexity and lacks grounding in biological neural computation. We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers.

TL;DR: 本文提出WiSparse方法，通过结合激活值和权重信息实现自适应稀疏化，在不训练的情况下显著提升大语言模型推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无训练激活稀疏方法仅依赖激活信息且采用统一稀疏率，忽视了权重与激活的协同关系及不同模型块对稀疏化的敏感性差异，导致性能次优。

Method: 提出Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity（WiSparse）：1）引入权重感知机制，融合激活幅值与预计算权重范数以识别重要通道；2）采用混合粒度稀疏分配：先通过进化搜索在模块间分配全局稀疏预算以保护敏感区域，再在模块内优化重建误差；3）改进稀疏计算核。

Result: 在50%稀疏率下，WiSparse在Llama3.1上保持97%的密集模型性能，比最强基线高2.23个百分点，并实现端到端推理速度提升21.4%。

Conclusion: WiSparse推动了无训练高效大模型推理的边界，在不牺牲性能的前提下显著加速推理，验证了联合建模激活与权重、差异化稀疏策略的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong capabilities but incur high inference costs due to dense computation and memory access. Training-free activation sparsity is a promising approach for efficient LLM inference, yet existing methods often rely solely on activation information and uniform sparsity ratios. This overlooks the critical interplay with weights and inter-block sensitivity variation, leading to suboptimal performance. We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error. We improve sparse kernels and demonstrate effectiveness on three representative models. Notably, at 50% sparsity, WiSparse preserves 97% of Llama3.1's dense performance, surpassing the strongest baseline by 2.23 percentage points while achieving a 21.4% acceleration in end-to-end inference speed. Our research advances the limits of training-free approaches for efficient LLM inference, pushing the boundaries of achievable speedup without training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TLVD的新因果建模框架，结合大语言模型（LLM）的元数据推理能力与传统因果发现算法（TCDA）的数据驱动建模能力，用于推断潜在变量及其语义。该方法通过构建含潜在变量的因果图、多LLM协作博弈求解贝叶斯纳什均衡以推断潜在变量，并利用LLM进行多源证据探索验证，显著提升了因果发现性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果发现算法受限于高质量数据缺乏、假设无潜变量干扰，且忽视潜变量语义，阻碍其广泛应用。

Method: 提出TLVD框架：1）数据驱动构建含潜变量的因果图；2）多LLM协作建模为不完全信息博弈，求解贝叶斯纳什均衡以推断潜变量；3）利用LLM在多源网页数据中探索证据以验证推断结果。

Result: 在三个脱敏真实患者数据集和两个基准数据集上评估，平均准确率（Acc）、因果准确率（CAcc）和证据引用率（ECit）分别提升32.67%、62.21%和26.72%。

Conclusion: TLVD有效融合LLM语义推理与TCDA数据建模能力，显著提升潜变量识别与因果结构学习的准确性与可追溯性，推动因果发现在现实场景中的落地应用。

Abstract: Revealing the underlying causal mechanisms in the real world is crucial for scientific and technological progress. Despite notable advances in recent decades, the lack of high-quality data and the reliance of traditional causal discovery algorithms (TCDA) on the assumption of no latent confounders, as well as their tendency to overlook the precise semantics of latent variables, have long been major obstacles to the broader application of causal discovery. To address this issue, we propose a novel causal modeling framework, TLVD, which integrates the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the data-driven modeling capabilities of TCDA for inferring latent variables and their semantics. Specifically, we first employ a data-driven approach to construct a causal graph that incorporates latent variables. Then, we employ multi-LLM collaboration for latent variable inference, modeling this process as a game with incomplete information and seeking its Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) to infer the possible specific latent variables. Finally, to validate the inferred latent variables across multiple real-world web-based data sources, we leverage LLMs for evidence exploration to ensure traceability. We comprehensively evaluate TLVD on three de-identified real patient datasets provided by a hospital and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of TLVD, with average improvements of 32.67% in Acc, 62.21% in CAcc, and 26.72% in ECit across the five datasets.

*Hong Li,Zhen Zhou,Honggang Zhang,Yuping Luo,Xinyue Wang,Han Gong,Zhiyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级、模型无关的诊断框架，用于量化数据并行训练中各工作节点间的优化动态不一致性（即‘静默不一致’），通过损失分散度、梯度范数分散度和梯度方向余弦相似度三个指标实现，无需修改模型或训练流程，并在1B参数模型上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步all-reduce虽保证权重数值一致，但无法确保各worker优化动态（如损失和梯度）在聚合前的一致性，这种‘静默不一致’在常规全局监控下不可见，影响训练稳定性与可诊断性。

Method: 提出三个轻量、无需模型修改的worker级一致性指标：损失分散度、梯度范数分散度、以及基于余弦相似度的梯度方向一致性；在8-NPU数据并行环境下对openPangu-1B模型进行全参数微调实验，引入受控的数据打乱与随机种子扰动以诱发不一致。

Result: 实验表明，随着跨rank随机性增强，损失/梯度分散度显著上升、方向一致性下降，而全局平均损失曲线仍保持平滑，证实了静默不一致的存在及其可观测性。

Conclusion: 所提指标能有效揭示大规模数据并行微调中隐藏的优化不稳定模式，为训练诊断与配置评估提供可靠、低开销的可见性支持。

Abstract: Data-parallel (DP) training with synchronous all-reduce is a dominant paradigm for full-parameter fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). While parameter synchronization guarantees numerical equivalence of model weights after each iteration, it does not necessarily imply alignment of worker-level optimization dynamics before gradient aggregation. This paper identifies and studies this latent mismatch, termed \emph{silent inconsistency}, where cross-worker divergence in losses and gradients can remain invisible under conventional aggregated monitoring signals. We propose a lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic framework that quantifies worker-level consistency using training signals readily available in standard pipelines. Specifically, we introduce three complementary metrics: loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency measured by inter-worker cosine similarity. The proposed metrics incur negligible overhead and require no modification to model architecture, synchronization mechanisms, or optimization algorithms. We validate the framework by fully fine-tuning the 1B-parameter \texttt{openPangu-Embedded-1B-V1.1} model on the \texttt{tatsu-lab/alpaca} dataset using an 8-NPU DP setup, under controlled perturbations of cross-rank stochasticity. Experimental results show that progressively desynchronized data shuffling and random seeds lead to substantial increases in loss/gradient dispersion and reduced directional alignment, despite smooth globally averaged loss curves. These findings demonstrate that the proposed indicators provide actionable visibility into hidden instability modes in large-scale DP fine-tuning, enabling more reliable diagnosis and configuration assessment.

TL;DR: 本文提出LACONIC方法，在强化学习训练中引入自适应的长度成本，以在不损害任务性能的前提下显著压缩大语言模型输出长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的长度控制方法依赖固定启发式奖励塑形，易与任务目标错位且调参脆弱，难以兼顾响应简洁性与任务性能。

Method: 提出LACONIC方法：在策略更新目标中融合任务奖励与可自适应调节权重的长度成本项，并提供理论保证。

Result: 在数学推理任务上保持或提升pass@1指标的同时，输出长度减少超50%；在通用知识和多语言基准上以44%更少token维持域外性能；无需修改推理流程，部署开销极小。

Conclusion: LACONIC实现了鲁棒、高效且即插即用的长度控制，为LLM的RL训练提供了实用且理论可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reward-driven training. Nevertheless, this process can introduce excessively long responses, inflating inference latency and computational overhead. Prior length-control approaches typically rely on fixed heuristic reward shaping, which can misalign with the task objective and require brittle tuning. In this work, we propose LACONIC, a reinforcement learning method that enforces a target token budget during training. Specifically, we update policy models using an augmented objective that combines the task reward with a length-based cost. To balance brevity and task performance, the cost scale is adaptively adjusted throughout training. This yields robust length control while preserving task reward. We provide a theoretical guarantee that support the method. Across mathematical reasoning models and datasets, LACONIC preserves or improves pass@1 while reducing output length by over 50%. It maintains out-of-domain performance on general knowledge and multilingual benchmarks with 44% fewer tokens. Moreover, LACONIC integrates into standard RL-tuning with no inference changes and minimal deployment overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有M个异构数据源的K臂多臂赌博机（MAB）问题，提出SOAR算法，能自适应选择最优（最小方差）数据源并实现接近单源MAB的最优实例依赖遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多源MAB中，各数据源噪声方差未知且不同，传统方法可能因使用高方差源而导致遗憾大幅上升；需设计能自动识别并利用最小方差源的算法。

Method: 提出SOAR算法：先用方差集中性界快速剪枝高方差源，再通过‘平衡的min-max LCB-UCB’策略同步进行最佳臂识别与最优数据源选择。

Result: SOAR达到实例依赖遗憾界Õ(σ*²∑_{i=2}^K log T/Δ_i + √(K∑_{j=1}^M σ_j²))，优于Uniform UCB等基线（其遗憾可能依赖最大方差σ_max²）。

Conclusion: SOAR在无先验知识下逼近最小方差单源MAB性能，仅引入不可避免的小额额外代价，理论与实验均验证其优越性。

Abstract: We study $K$-armed Multiarmed Bandit (MAB) problem with $M$ heterogeneous data sources, each exhibiting unknown and distinct noise variances $\{σ_j^2\}_{j=1}^M$. The learner's objective is standard MAB regret minimization, with the additional complexity of adaptively selecting which data source to query from at each round. We propose Source-Optimistic Adaptive Regret minimization (SOAR), a novel algorithm that quickly prunes high-variance sources using sharp variance-concentration bounds, followed by a `balanced min-max LCB-UCB approach' that seamlessly integrates the parallel tasks of identifying the best arm and the optimal (minimum-variance) data source. Our analysis shows SOAR achieves an instance-dependent regret bound of $\tilde{O}\left({σ^*}^2\sum_{i=2}^K \frac{\log T}{Δ_i} + \sqrt{K \sum_{j=1}^M σ_j^2}\right)$, up to preprocessing costs depending only on problem parameters, where ${σ^*}^2 := \min_j σ_j^2$ is the minimum source variance and $Δ_i$ denotes the suboptimality gap of the $i$-th arm. This result is both surprising as despite lacking prior knowledge of the minimum-variance source among $M$ alternatives, SOAR attains the optimal instance-dependent regret of standard single-source MAB with variance ${σ^*}^2$, while incurring only an small (and unavoidable) additive cost of $\tilde O(\sqrt{K \sum_{j=1}^M σ_j^2})$ towards the optimal (minimum variance) source identification. Our theoretical bounds represent a significant improvement over some proposed baselines, e.g. Uniform UCB or Explore-then-Commit UCB, which could potentially suffer regret scaling with $σ_{\max}^2$ in place of ${σ^*}^2$-a gap that can be arbitrarily large when $σ_{\max} \gg σ^*$. Experiments on multiple synthetic problem instances and the real-world MovieLens\;25M dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of SOAR over the baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于置换的零校准框架，用于修正表征相似性度量中因模型规模（深度/宽度）带来的混淆效应，并据此重新检验‘柏拉图表征假说’，发现全局谱相似性在校准后消失，而局部邻域相似性仍显著一致，从而提出‘亚里士多德表征假说’。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表征相似性度量受神经网络规模（如深度、宽度）影响而产生系统性偏差，导致对表征收敛性的误判，亟需一种能消除规模干扰的统计校准方法。

Method: 提出一种基于置换检验的零校准框架，可将任意表征相似性度量转化为具有统计保证的校准分数，并在多个模型和模态上进行实证验证。

Result: 校准后，先前支持柏拉图假说的全局谱相似性显著减弱；而局部邻域相似性（非局部距离）在跨模态间仍保持显著一致性。

Conclusion: 神经网络表征并非收敛于统一全局统计模型（柏拉图假说），而是趋向于共享的局部邻域关系，由此提出亚里士多德表征假说。

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that representations from neural networks are converging to a common statistical model of reality. We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调（PEFT）方法局限于欧氏空间，难以有效建模语言数据中固有的复杂几何结构（如层次性、循环性）；单一几何空间（即使曲率可学习）仍限制表示能力。

Method: 提出Mixture of Space（MoS）统一框架，支持多几何空间（欧氏、双曲、球面）协同建模；在此基础上构建MoSLoRA，将LoRA扩展为含异构几何专家的低秩适配器，并设计轻量级路由机制以降低流形切换开销；同时分析曲率优化对训练稳定性和性能的影响。

Result: 在多个基准测试中一致优于强基线，MATH500提升达5.6%，MAWPS提升达15.9%。

Conclusion: 混合几何空间建模能显著增强PEFT的表示能力与适应性，MoSLoRA为语言模型的几何感知高效微调提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) emerging as a key technique for downstream task adaptation. However, existing PEFT methods mainly operate in Euclidean space, fundamentally limiting their capacity to capture complex geometric structures inherent in language data. While alternative geometric spaces, like hyperbolic geometries for hierarchical data and spherical manifolds for circular patterns, offer theoretical advantages, forcing representations into a single manifold type ultimately limits expressiveness, even when curvature parameters are learnable. To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GLU及其类似架构在前沿大模型中广泛应用，但其成功多为经验性发现，缺乏理论解释；本文旨在从数值分析第一性原理出发，揭示其优越缩放行为的根本原因。

Method: 运用函数逼近理论与数值分析工具，分析GLU与MLP在函数重建任务中的渐近逼近阶与参数缩放关系；构造具体参数方案，并在1D函数逼近任务上进行实证验证；基于理论洞见设计新型Gated Quadratic Unit。

Conclusion: 门控二次结构（如GLU）因内在x^2项获得更高阶逼近能力，可导出更优缩放律；该工作为从数值理论出发、指导大模型架构设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Scaling laws can be understood from ground-up numerical analysis, where traditional function approximation theory can explain shifts in model architecture choices. GLU variants now dominate frontier LLMs and similar outer-product architectures are prevalent in ranking models. The success of these architectures has mostly been left as an empirical discovery. In this paper, we apply the tools of numerical analysis to expose a key factor: these models have an $x^2$ which enables \emph{asymptotically} faster scaling than MLPs. GLUs have piecewise quadratic functional forms that are sufficient to exhibit quadratic order of approximation. Our key contribution is to demonstrate that the $L(P)$ scaling slope is $L(P)\propto P^{-3}$ for GLUs but only $L(P)=P^{-2}$ for MLPs on function reconstruction problems. We provide a parameter construction and empirical verification of these slopes for 1D function approximation. From the first principles we discover, we make one stride and propose the ``Gated Quadratic Unit'' which has an even steeper $L(P)$ slope than the GLU and MLP. This opens the possibility of architecture design from first principles numerical theory to unlock superior scaling in large models.

TL;DR: 本文提出Time2Decide方法，利用Transformer直接处理协方差矩阵以求解含ℓ₁约束的二次规划（QP）问题，在投资组合优化等决策任务中实现端到端一阶推理，性能超越传统预测后优化（PtO）流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型（TSFM）在涉及协方差矩阵的决策问题（如投资组合优化）中未显式利用二阶统计信息，导致性能受限；而经典‘预测后优化’（PtO）流程存在误差传播和计算开销问题。

Method: 理论证明线性注意力机制可逐行token化矩阵变量并模拟梯度下降求解无约束QP；结合MLP与反馈回路，扩展至求解ℓ₁正则化及ℓ₁约束QP；据此提出Time2Decide框架——将变元间协方差矩阵显式注入TSFM输入。

Result: Time2Decide在标准投资组合优化任务上一致优于基线TSFM；在合适设定下亦超越经典PtO流程；实验证明Transformer显式利用二阶统计信息可提升复杂决策任务的一次前向推理能力。

Conclusion: Transformer可通过结构化设计（如线性注意力+MLP+反馈）原生求解QP类优化问题；显式引入协方差矩阵作为输入显著增强其在金融决策等实际场景中的端到端优化能力。

Abstract: We explore the use of transformers for solving quadratic programs and how this capability benefits decision-making problems that involve covariance matrices. We first show that the linear attention mechanism can provably solve unconstrained QPs by tokenizing the matrix variables (e.g.~$A$ of the objective $\frac{1}{2}x^\top Ax+b^\top x$) row-by-row and emulating gradient descent iterations. Furthermore, by incorporating MLPs, a transformer block can solve (i) $\ell_1$-penalized QPs by emulating iterative soft-thresholding and (ii) $\ell_1$-constrained QPs when equipped with an additional feedback loop. Our theory motivates us to introduce Time2Decide: a generic method that enhances a time series foundation model (TSFM) by explicitly feeding the covariance matrix between the variates. We empirically find that Time2Decide uniformly outperforms the base TSFM model for the classical portfolio optimization problem that admits an $\ell_1$-constrained QP formulation. Remarkably, Time2Decide also outperforms the classical "Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)" procedure, where we first forecast the returns and then explicitly solve a constrained QP, in suitable settings. Our results demonstrate that transformers benefit from explicit use of second-order statistics, and this can enable them to effectively solve complex decision-making problems, like portfolio construction, in one forward pass.

Motivation: 现有工作难以在非平稳环境下同时保证次线性遗憾和次线性约束违反；本文旨在填补这一空白，尤其针对约束为随机、损失可任意变化的情形，并实现对约束对抗性的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一系列自适应算法：在全反馈下达到O~(√T + C) 遗憾与正向违反；扩展至仅损失为带反馈情形；进一步设计适用于约束也为带反馈情形的算法。

Result: 全反馈下：O~(√T + C) 遗憾与正向违反；仅损失带反馈：类似保证；约束也为带反馈：O~(√T + C) 正向违反、O~(√T + C√T) 遗憾。C 表征约束非平稳程度。

Conclusion: 本文首次实现了在约束随机、损失任意（含对抗）且非平稳环境下的最优遗憾与正向违反权衡，并提供随约束对抗性平滑退化的统一保证。

Abstract: We study the constrained variant of the \emph{multi-armed bandit} (MAB) problem, in which the learner aims not only at minimizing the total loss incurred during the learning dynamic, but also at controlling the violation of multiple \emph{unknown} constraints, under both \emph{full} and \emph{bandit feedback}. We consider a non-stationary environment that subsumes both stochastic and adversarial models and where, at each round, both losses and constraints are drawn from distributions that may change arbitrarily over time. In such a setting, it is provably not possible to guarantee both sublinear regret and sublinear violation. Accordingly, prior work has mainly focused either on settings with stochastic constraints or on relaxing the benchmark with fully adversarial constraints (\emph{e.g.}, via competitive ratios with respect to the optimum). We provide the first algorithms that achieve optimal rates of regret and \emph{positive} constraint violation when the constraints are stochastic while the losses may vary arbitrarily, and that simultaneously yield guarantees that degrade smoothly with the degree of adversariality of the constraints. Specifically, under \emph{full feedback} we propose an algorithm attaining $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C)$ regret and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C)$ {positive} violation, where $C$ quantifies the amount of non-stationarity in the constraints. We then show how to extend these guarantees when only bandit feedback is available for the losses. Finally, when \emph{bandit feedback} is available for the constraints, we design an algorithm achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C)$ {positive} violation and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C\sqrt{T})$ regret.

### [561] [Governing AI Forgetting: Auditing for Machine Unlearning Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14553)
*Qinqi Lin,Ningning Ding,Lingjie Duan,Jianwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于审计机器遗忘（MU）合规性的经济框架，结合认证遗忘理论与监管执行，通过假设检验解释MU的验证不确定性，并构建博弈论模型分析审计员与AI操作员之间的策略互动。研究解决了MU特有的非线性难题，将复杂双变量问题转化为可解单变量辅助问题，证明了均衡的存在性、唯一性与结构特性；发现删除请求增多时，最优检查强度反而下降；并揭示‘不披露审计’虽具信息优势，却降低监管成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管法律要求‘被遗忘权’，AI运营商常未能履行数据删除义务；机器遗忘（MU）虽提供技术方案，但其技术可行性与监管落地之间存在根本鸿沟，亟需可验证、可激励的合规审计机制。

Method: 提出融合认证遗忘理论与监管经济学的审计框架：1）用假设检验刻画MU验证不确定性，定义审计员检测能力；2）构建博弈论模型刻画审计员与运营商的策略互动；3）针对MU引发的效用与检测概率非线性，将原双变量非线性不动点问题转化为单变量辅助问题，实现解耦并严格证明均衡性质。

Result: 1）发现删除请求数量上升时，审计员最优检查强度反向下降，因运营商遗忘能力减弱使违规更易检出；该结论与中国近年实际审计频次下降现象一致；2）证明‘不披露审计’虽增强信息不对称优势，却导致单位监管成本带来的合规提升更低，即成本效益反而劣于‘披露审计’。

Conclusion: 本工作首次将MU的技术属性系统嵌入监管经济学框架，不仅为AI数据合规审计提供可计算、可解释的理论工具，更揭示了直觉相悖但实证支持的关键政策启示——适度降低显性审计强度可能提升整体合规效率，且透明化审计机制在成本效益上更具优势。

Abstract: Despite legal mandates for the right to be forgotten, AI operators routinely fail to comply with data deletion requests. While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了RNM-TD3，首个在强化学习中应用N:M结构化稀疏性的方法，在保持硬件加速兼容性的同时，提升了稀疏模型的性能，甚至在高稀疏度（如1:8）下仍具竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习中的稀疏化方法多采用细粒度非结构化稀疏，难以硬件加速；而粗粒度结构化稀疏虽利于硬件，但常导致性能下降和剪枝复杂度上升，亟需兼顾压缩率、性能与硬件效率的新方案。

Method: 提出在off-policy RL（TD3）中全程施加行级N:M结构化稀疏约束，构建RNM-TD3框架，适配支持N:M稀疏矩阵运算的硬件加速器。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，RNM-TD3在50%-75%稀疏度（如2:4、1:4）下超越稠密基线，Ant环境中2:4稀疏时性能提升达14%；在87.5%（1:8）稀疏度下仍保持竞争力，并具备训练加速潜力。

Conclusion: N:M结构化稀疏是强化学习模型压缩的有效新范式，可在显著压缩模型的同时提升性能并支持硬件加速，为高效DRL部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Sparsity is a well-studied technique for compressing deep neural networks (DNNs) without compromising performance. In deep reinforcement learning (DRL), neural networks with up to 5% of their original weights can still be trained with minimal performance loss compared to their dense counterparts. However, most existing methods rely on unstructured fine-grained sparsity, which limits hardware acceleration opportunities due to irregular computation patterns. Structured coarse-grained sparsity enables hardware acceleration, yet typically degrades performance and increases pruning complexity. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study on N:M structured sparsity in RL, which balances compression, performance, and hardware efficiency. Our framework enforces row-wise N:M sparsity throughout training for all networks in off-policy RL (TD3), maintaining compatibility with accelerators that support N:M sparse matrix operations. Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks show that RNM-TD3, our N:M sparse agent, outperforms its dense counterpart at 50%-75% sparsity (e.g., 2:4 and 1:4), achieving up to a 14% increase in performance at 2:4 sparsity on the Ant environment. RNM-TD3 remains competitive even at 87.5% sparsity (1:8), while enabling potential training speedups.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在约束多臂赌博机（MAB）问题中实现算法可复制性（replicability）的问题，提出了首个适用于无约束MAB的可复制UCB类算法，并设计出在遗憾和约束违反方面与不可复制算法性能相当的可复制算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中实验可重现性的需求，将算法可复制性扩展到带约束的在线学习场景（如约束MAB）。

Method: 设计基于乐观主义原则（optimism in-the-face-of-uncertainty）的可复制UCB类算法，推广至约束MAB设置，保证高概率下多次执行决策序列一致。

Result: 实现了约束MAB中的可复制性；所提算法在累积遗憾和约束违反上达到与非可复制算法相同的关于T的渐近界；首次构造出无约束MAB的可复制UCB算法。

Conclusion: 可复制性可在约束MAB中实现，且无需牺牲标准性能指标；乐观策略可以兼容可复制性，为可复制在线学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Algorithmic \emph{replicability} has recently been introduced to address the need for reproducible experiments in machine learning. A \emph{replicable online learning} algorithm is one that takes the same sequence of decisions across different executions in the same environment, with high probability. We initiate the study of algorithmic replicability in \emph{constrained} MAB problems, where a learner interacts with an unknown stochastic environment for $T$ rounds, seeking not only to maximize reward but also to satisfy multiple constraints. Our main result is that replicability can be achieved in constrained MABs. Specifically, we design replicable algorithms whose regret and constraint violation match those of non-replicable ones in terms of $T$. As a key step toward these guarantees, we develop the first replicable UCB-like algorithm for \emph{unconstrained} MABs, showing that algorithms that employ the optimism in-the-face-of-uncertainty principle can be replicable, a result that we believe is of independent interest.

### [565] [Decoupled Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning via Hamiltonian Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14587)
*Minh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解耦的连续时间Actor-Critic算法，通过交替更新优势率函数q和值函数V，解决了传统离散时间RL在连续时间事件驱动控制中Q函数退化、现有连续时间方法训练不稳定等问题，并在理论收敛性和实际任务（如交易）中均取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准离散时间强化学习在连续时间、非均匀事件驱动场景下失效（Q函数坍缩为V函数）；现有连续时间方法依赖复杂约束（如鞅损失或正交性），训练敏感且不稳定。

Method: 提出解耦的连续时间Actor-Critic框架：q函数由V函数的扩散生成元导出；V函数通过哈密顿驱动的值流更新，该流在无穷小时间步下仍保持信息量（避免max/softmax失效）；采用交替更新机制。

Result: 理论证明了新算法的严格收敛性（绕过生成元哈密顿量缺乏上确界范数收缩性的难点）；实验表明在连续控制基准和真实交易任务中均超越现有连续/离散时间方法，单季度收益达21%，接近第二优方法的两倍。

Conclusion: 解耦设计与生成元-哈密顿协同机制有效克服了连续时间RL的核心建模与优化难题，为事件驱动控制提供了更鲁棒、可证、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world control problems, ranging from finance to robotics, evolve in continuous time with non-uniform, event-driven decisions. Standard discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL), based on fixed-step Bellman updates, struggles in this setting: as time gaps shrink, the $Q$-function collapses to the value function $V$, eliminating action ranking. Existing continuous-time methods reintroduce action information via an advantage-rate function $q$. However, they enforce optimality through complicated martingale losses or orthogonality constraints, which are sensitive to the choice of test processes. These approaches entangle $V$ and $q$ into a large, complex optimization problem that is difficult to train reliably. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm with alternating updates: $q$ is learned from diffusion generators on $V$, and $V$ is updated via a Hamiltonian-based value flow that remains informative under infinitesimal time steps, where standard max/softmax backups fail. Theoretically, we prove rigorous convergence via new probabilistic arguments, sidestepping the challenge that generator-based Hamiltonians lack Bellman-style contraction under the sup-norm. Empirically, our method outperforms prior continuous-time and leading discrete-time baselines across challenging continuous-control benchmarks and a real-world trading task, achieving 21% profit over a single quarter$-$nearly doubling the second-best method.

Conclusion: OPBench为图学习在公共卫生危机（尤其是阿片危机）中的应用提供了可靠评估平台，有望加速算法创新与实际落地。

Abstract: The opioid epidemic continues to ravage communities worldwide, straining healthcare systems, disrupting families, and demanding urgent computational solutions. To combat this lethal opioid crisis, graph learning methods have emerged as a promising paradigm for modeling complex drug-related phenomena. However, a significant gap remains: there is no comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating these methods across real-world opioid crisis scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce OPBench, the first comprehensive opioid benchmark comprising five datasets across three critical application domains: opioid overdose detection from healthcare claims, illicit drug trafficking detection from digital platforms, and drug misuse prediction from dietary patterns. Specifically, OPBench incorporates diverse graph structures, including heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs, to preserve the rich and complex relational information among drug-related data. To address data scarcity, we collaborate with domain experts and authoritative institutions to curate and annotate datasets while adhering to privacy and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, we establish a unified evaluation framework with standardized protocols, predefined data splits, and reproducible baselines to facilitate fair and systematic comparison among graph learning methods. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the strengths and limitations of existing graph learning methods, thereby providing actionable insights for future research in combating the opioid crisis.

*Karim Galliamov,Syed M Ahsan Kazmi,Adil Khan,Adín Ramírez Rivera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息瓶颈（IB）的正则化方法，用于提升概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）的准确性和概念忠实性，通过约束输入与概念间的互信息 $I(X;C)$ 并保留概念与标签间的任务相关互信息 $I(C;Y)$，实现最小充分的概念表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）虽追求可解释性，但常面临精度下降和概念泄漏（concept leakage）问题，导致模型对概念层干预不可靠、忠实性不足。

Method: 引入显式的信息瓶颈正则项，最小化输入X与概念C之间的互信息 $I(X;C)$，同时最大化概念C与标签Y之间的互信息 $I(C;Y)$；推导出两种实用变体：变分目标函数和基于熵的代理损失，并无缝集成到标准CBM训练中，无需修改网络结构或增加监督信号。

Result: 在六个CBM家族和三个基准数据集上的实验表明，IB正则化模型持续优于基线；信息平面分析验证了其符合预期的信息压缩行为；该方法提升了预测性能与概念干预可靠性。

Conclusion: 强制实施最小充分的概念瓶颈不仅能提升模型性能，还能增强概念层干预的可信度；所提正则器具有理论基础、架构无关，统一了训练范式，解决了以往评估不一致的问题。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to deliver interpretable predictions by routing decisions through a human-understandable concept layer, yet they often suffer reduced accuracy and concept leakage that undermines faithfulness. We introduce an explicit Information Bottleneck regularizer on the concept layer that penalizes $I(X;C)$ while preserving task-relevant information in $I(C;Y)$, encouraging minimal-sufficient concept representations. We derive two practical variants (a variational objective and an entropy-based surrogate) and integrate them into standard CBM training without architectural changes or additional supervision. Evaluated across six CBM families and three benchmarks, the IB-regularized models consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts. Information-plane analyses further corroborate the intended behavior. These results indicate that enforcing a minimal-sufficient concept bottleneck improves both predictive performance and the reliability of concept-level interventions. The proposed regularizer offers a theoretic-grounded, architecture-agnostic path to more faithful and intervenable CBMs, resolving prior evaluation inconsistencies by aligning training protocols and demonstrating robust gains across model families and datasets.

### [568] [An Embarrassingly Simple Way to Optimize Orthogonal Matrices at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14656)
*Adrián Javaloy,Antonio Vergari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为POGO的新优化算法，用于高效处理大规模正交性约束问题，相比现有方法更快速、GPU友好，并在实践中全程保持正交性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正交性约束在鲁棒与概率机器学习中广泛存在，但现有优化器计算开销大、难以扩展到数百或数千约束的问题；Landing算法虽有改进但仍需临时放松正交性。

Method: 基于Landing算法思想进行改进，引入现代自适应优化器，设计仅含5次矩阵乘法的轻量级、GPU友好的POGO算法，全程严格满足正交约束且超参数更少。

Result: POGO在多个基准任务上显著优于近期优化器，可在数分钟内优化含数千个正交矩阵的问题，而其他方法需数小时；已开源PyTorch实现。

Conclusion: POGO为在大规模机器学习中真正实用化正交性约束设定了新里程碑。

Abstract: Orthogonality constraints are ubiquitous in robust and probabilistic machine learning. Unfortunately, current optimizers are computationally expensive and do not scale to problems with hundreds or thousands of constraints. One notable exception is the Landing algorithm (Ablin et al., 2024) which, however comes at the expense of temporarily relaxing orthogonality. In this work, we revisit and improve on the ideas behind Landing, enabling the inclusion of modern adaptive optimizers while ensuring that orthogonal constraints are effectively met. Remarkably, these improvements come at little to no cost, and reduce the number of required hyperparemeters. Our algorithm POGO is fast and GPU-friendly, consisting of only 5 matrix products, and in practice maintains orthogonality at all times. On several challenging benchmarks, POGO greatly outperforms recent optimizers and shows it can optimize problems with thousands of orthogonal matrices in minutes while alternatives would take hours. As such, POGO sets a milestone to finally exploit orthogonality constraints in ML at scale. A PyTorch implementation of POGO is publicly available at https://github.com/adrianjav/pogo.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于傅里叶空间的伪微分增强型物理信息神经网络（PINNs），通过在频域中对PDE残差进行高阶伪微分增强，提升训练效率、高频学习能力和泛化性，并支持分数阶导数及非欧几里得域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs存在频率偏差、训练收敛慢、低采样下易陷入平台期等问题；梯度增强虽有改进但局限于空间域，而频域微分具有乘法简洁性，且便于处理高阶与分数阶导数。

Method: 将PDE残差在傅里叶空间中应用伪微分算子（即乘以wavenumber的幂）进行增强，结合Monte Carlo采样避免FFT的网格依赖性，并兼容傅里叶特征嵌入等先进PINN技术；理论分析聚焦于神经正切核（NTK）谱衰减的改善。

Result: 相较标准PINNs，在更少迭代次数下实现更低的PDE残差与数值误差；缓解频率偏差，增强高频成分早期学习；支持分数阶PDE建模；在稀疏配点、非结构网格及非欧几里得域中保持有效性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 伪微分增强是一种通用、高效且理论可解释的PINN改进范式，拓展了频域正则化在物理驱动学习中的应用边界。

Abstract: We present pseudo-differential enhanced physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), an extension of gradient enhancement but in Fourier space. Gradient enhancement of PINNs dictates that the PDE residual is taken to a higher differential order than prescribed by the PDE, added to the objective as an augmented term in order to improve training and overall learning fidelity. We propose the same procedure after application via Fourier transforms, since differentiating in Fourier space is multiplication with the Fourier wavenumber under suitable decay. Our methods are fast and efficient. Our methods oftentimes achieve superior PINN versus numerical error in fewer training iterations, potentially pair well with few samples in collocation, and can on occasion break plateaus in low collocation settings. Moreover, our methods are suitable for fractional derivatives. We establish that our methods improve spectral eigenvalue decay of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), and so our methods contribute towards the learning of high frequencies in early training, mitigating the effects of frequency bias up to the polynomial order and possibly greater with smooth activations. Our methods accommodate advanced techniques in PINNs, such as Fourier feature embeddings. A pitfall of discrete Fourier transforms via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is mesh subjugation, and so we demonstrate compatibility of our methods for greater mesh flexibility and invariance on alternative Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains via Monte Carlo methods and otherwise.

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度生成模型在多样性方面的系统性偏差，发现现有模型生成样本的多样性普遍低于真实数据分布，并分析了这种偏差源于有限样本下熵基多样性度量的固有低估特性，最后提出了基于Vendi和RKE的多样性感知正则化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成模型是否忠实地捕捉真实数据分布的多样性，而不仅关注样本质量。

Method: 使用无参考熵基多样性评分（Vendi和RKE）直接比较生成样本与测试样本的多样性；分析熵基多样性评分的有限样本行为；提出多样性感知的正则化与引导策略。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，测试数据的Vendi和RKE得分始终显著高于生成样本，表明现代生成模型存在系统性多样性偏低偏差；理论分析表明该偏差源于有限样本下熵估计的向下偏移；实验证明基于Vendi/RKE的正则化可缓解该偏差。

Conclusion: 现代生成模型普遍存在多样性低估问题，其根源在于训练目标基于有限经验分布导致的内在偏差；应采用多样性感知的优化策略以更忠实地建模真实分布。

Abstract: Deep generative models have achieved great success in producing high-quality samples, making them a central tool across machine learning applications. Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SynthSAEBench，一个用于生成大规模、具有现实特征（如相关性、层次结构和叠加）的合成数据的工具包，以及标准化基准模型SynthSAEBench-16k，以精确评估稀疏自编码器（SAEs）架构改进。该基准复现了LLM中已知的SAE现象，并揭示了一种新失败模式：匹配追踪SAEs利用叠加噪声提升重建性能却未学习真实特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM上的SAE基准噪声大、难以区分架构改进；合成数据实验规模小且不真实，无法提供有意义的比较。

Method: 构建SynthSAEBench工具包，支持生成具相关性、层次性与超位置等真实特征的大规模合成数据，并设计标准化基准模型SynthSAEBench-16k；通过复现LLM中SAE现象及开展控制实验分析SAE行为。

Result: 成功复现了重建与潜在质量指标脱节、探针效果差、L0调节的精度-召回权衡等LLM SAE现象；发现匹配追踪SAEs会利用叠加噪声过拟合重建，而不学习真实特征。

Conclusion: SynthSAEBench通过提供真实特征与可控消融实验，弥补了LLM基准的不足，使研究者可在扩展到LLM前精准诊断SAE失效模式并验证架构改进。

Abstract: Improving Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) requires benchmarks that can precisely validate architectural innovations. However, current SAE benchmarks on LLMs are often too noisy to differentiate architectural improvements, and current synthetic data experiments are too small-scale and unrealistic to provide meaningful comparisons. We introduce SynthSAEBench, a toolkit for generating large-scale synthetic data with realistic feature characteristics including correlation, hierarchy, and superposition, and a standardized benchmark model, SynthSAEBench-16k, enabling direct comparison of SAE architectures. Our benchmark reproduces several previously observed LLM SAE phenomena, including the disconnect between reconstruction and latent quality metrics, poor SAE probing results, and a precision-recall trade-off mediated by L0. We further use our benchmark to identify a new failure mode: Matching Pursuit SAEs exploit superposition noise to improve reconstruction without learning ground-truth features, suggesting that more expressive encoders can easily overfit. SynthSAEBench complements LLM benchmarks by providing ground-truth features and controlled ablations, enabling researchers to precisely diagnose SAE failure modes and validate architectural improvements before scaling to LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了大语言模型指令微调中的目标指令选择问题，解耦并评估了数据表示与选择算法两个核心组件，发现基于梯度的数据表示在低预算下配合贪心轮询算法效果最佳，且多种现有算法可统一为近似距离最小化，并提供了新的泛化界支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标指令选择方法缺乏统一评估框架，存在预算不一致、缺少零样本基线、关键组件贡献混淆等问题，导致实践者缺乏可操作指导。

Method: 提出一个解耦数据表示与选择算法的系统分析框架，对多种表示（特别是梯度表示）和算法（如贪心轮询）进行跨模型、任务和预算的受控比较，并从距离最小化视角统一解释现有算法，推导相应泛化界。

Result: 发现仅梯度类数据表示能使得所选子集与查询集的相似性稳定预测性能；梯度表示+贪心轮询在低预算下平均最优，但优势随预算增大而减弱；多个算法可被统一解释为近似距离最小化，并获得理论支持。

Conclusion: 梯度表示是目标指令选择中更鲁棒的关键因素，低预算场景应优先采用梯度表示与贪心轮询组合；研究为LLM指令微调的数据选择提供了原则性基础与实用洞见。

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often involves selecting a subset of instruction training data from a large candidate pool, using a small query set from the target task. Despite growing interest, the literature on targeted instruction selection remains fragmented and opaque: methods vary widely in selection budgets, often omit zero-shot baselines, and frequently entangle the contributions of key components. As a result, practitioners lack actionable guidance on selecting instructions for their target tasks. In this work, we aim to bring clarity to this landscape by disentangling and systematically analyzing the two core ingredients: data representation and selection algorithms. Our framework enables controlled comparisons across models, tasks, and budgets. We find that only gradient-based data representations choose subsets whose similarity to the query consistently predicts performance across datasets and models. While no single method dominates, gradient-based representations paired with a greedy round-robin selection algorithm tend to perform best on average at low budgets, but these benefits diminish at larger budgets. Finally, we unify several existing selection algorithms as forms of approximate distance minimization between the selected subset and the query set, and support this view with new generalization bounds. More broadly, our findings provide critical insights and a foundation for more principled data selection in LLM fine-tuning.

Result: 理论分析揭示了达到目标精度所需训练轮数与每轮成本降低之间的权衡关系；实验在多层感知机、BagNets和视觉Transformer上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的无偏随机反向传播方法具有显著降低深度学习训练成本的潜力。

Abstract: In this work we introduce methods to reduce the computational and memory costs of training deep neural networks. Our approach consists in replacing exact vector-jacobian products by randomized, unbiased approximations thereof during backpropagation. We provide a theoretical analysis of the trade-off between the number of epochs needed to achieve a target precision and the cost reduction for each epoch. We then identify specific unbiased estimates of vector-jacobian products for which we establish desirable optimality properties of minimal variance under sparsity constraints. Finally we provide in-depth experiments on multi-layer perceptrons, BagNets and Visual Transfomers architectures. These validate our theoretical results, and confirm the potential of our proposed unbiased randomized backpropagation approach for reducing the cost of deep learning.

*Nozomu Fujisawa,Masaaki Kondo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出D2-LoRA，一种参数高效微调方法，在有限数据与计算资源下显著提升多任务性能，并支持无延迟权重合并。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际数据和算力受限条件下，系统探索参数高效微调的设计空间，提升小样本、低训练轮次下的模型泛化能力与稳定性。

Method: D2-LoRA采用带符号的低秩残差更新（含加法与减法分量），并引入训练时列向投影以保持各列范数接近原始值；训练后可将适配器合并为单个权重矩阵，实现零推理开销。

Result: 在8个问答与阅读理解基准上平均准确率达76.4%（5k样本/任务、2 epoch）；相比LoRA提升2.2个百分点，优于DoRA多数任务；在生成任务中ROUGE-L+1.2、胜率+1.1%；训练波动降低36%；合并后数值误差仅约0.03%，吞吐量提升1.91倍；训练开销仅增19%。

Conclusion: D2-LoRA通过结构设计而非单纯增加参数实现性能提升，兼具高精度、强稳定性、低开销与无缝合并能力，为参数高效微调提供了新范式。

Abstract: We systematically investigate the parameter-efficient fine-tuning design space under practical data and compute constraints, and propose D2-LoRA. D2-LoRA achieves 76.4 percent average accuracy across eight question answering and reading comprehension benchmarks using only 5k training samples per task and two epochs, while preserving algebraic mergeability at inference with near-exact numerical equivalence. The method combines signed low-rank residual updates with additive and subtractive components, together with a train-time column-wise projection that keeps each column close to its original norm. After training, the adapter is merged into a single weight matrix, adding zero inference latency. Compared with LoRA, D2-LoRA improves average accuracy by 2.2 percentage points; at matched parameter counts (LoRA rank 2r versus D2-LoRA rank r), the improvement is 1.6 points, indicating gains from architectural design rather than increased parameterization. Compared with DoRA, it matches or exceeds performance on most tasks. Beyond QA and reading comprehension, D2-LoRA improves generative tasks (plus 1.2 ROUGE-L and plus 1.1 percent win rate) and shows 36 percent lower training volatility. The merge preserves numerical fidelity (mean gap about 0.03 percentage points) and recovers about 1.91x evaluation throughput. Training overhead is 19 percent, comparable to DoRA, and decreases with longer input sequences. We provide a geometric analysis explaining how the projection stabilizes training, together with ablation studies isolating the contribution of each design component.

*Julien Siems,Riccardo Grazzi,Kirill Kalinin,Hitesh Ballani,Babak Rahmani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文将排列组合这一状态跟踪任务转化为代码形式，通过REPL痕迹（包含打印和变量变换）来揭示状态，从而使其适用于语言模型的next-token预测训练范式；实验表明线性RNN在此设置下表现优异，而Transformer仍失败；进一步研究发现，当动作不可完全观测时（建模为带确定性状态揭示的随机有限自动机），线性RNN可能不如非线性RNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有状态跟踪任务（如排列组合）多为seq2seq形式，与语言模型常用的next-token预测训练方式不兼容；此外，实际代码中动作常不可完全观测，需更贴近现实的建模。

Method: 将排列组合任务转化为可执行的REPL代码痕迹，插入print语句以显式揭示中间状态；构建带确定性状态揭示的随机有限自动机（PFA）模型，用于刻画动作不可观情形下的状态跟踪问题。

Result: 线性RNN在REPL代码形式的排列组合任务上表现优异，而Transformer仍失败；但在动作不可完全观测的PFA设定下，线性RNN性能可能劣于非线性RNN。

Conclusion: 任务表征方式（如转化为代码并显式揭示状态）显著影响模型表现；线性RNN虽在理想可观测状态下强大，但其优势依赖于可观测性假设，在更现实的不可观测动作场景下可能失效。

Abstract: Over the last years, state-tracking tasks, particularly permutation composition, have become a testbed to understand the limits of sequence models architectures like Transformers and RNNs (linear and non-linear). However, these are often sequence-to-sequence tasks: learning to map actions (permutations) to states, which is incompatible with the next-token prediction setting commonly used to train language models. We address this gap by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces that interleave state-reveals through prints and variable transformations. We show that linear RNNs capable of state-tracking excel also in this setting, while Transformers still fail. Motivated by this representation, we investigate why tracking states in code is generally difficult: actions are not always fully observable. We frame this as tracking the state of a probabilistic finite-state automaton with deterministic state reveals and show that linear RNNs can be worse than non-linear RNNs at tracking states in this setup.

*Rodrigo Carmo Terin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文将神经网络中正齐次激活函数引起的参数重参数化对称性解释为规范冗余，并引入规范适配坐标和软轨道选择功能，以改善优化条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络中正齐次激活函数导致的参数空间重参数化对称性（即神经元尺度重缩放不改变输入-输出函数）尚未被充分用于优化分析，作者希望从规范理论角度理解并利用该对称性。

Method: 将重参数化对称性建模为规范冗余，构建规范适配坐标分解不变方向与尺度不平衡方向；设计仅作用于冗余尺度坐标的软轨道选择（范数平衡）泛函；理论分析其对不平衡模态的耗散松弛效应，并通过控制实验验证其对学习率稳定性和尺度漂移的影响。

Result: 所提轨道选择惩罚项能显著扩大稳定学习率区间、抑制尺度漂移，且不损害模型表达能力；理论证明其诱导不平衡模式的耗散松弛以保持实现函数不变。

Conclusion: 神经网络参数空间的规范轨道几何结构与优化条件密切相关，该工作建立了规范理论概念与机器学习实践之间的具体结构性联系。

Abstract: Neural networks with positively homogeneous activations exhibit an exact continuous reparametrization symmetry: neuron-wise rescalings generate parameter-space orbits along which the input--output function is invariant. We interpret this symmetry as a gauge redundancy and introduce gauge-adapted coordinates that separate invariant and scale-imbalance directions. Inspired by gauge fixing in field theory, we introduce a soft orbit-selection (norm-balancing) functional acting only on redundant scale coordinates. We show analytically that it induces dissipative relaxation of imbalance modes to preserve the realized function. In controlled experiments, this orbit-selection penalty expands the stable learning-rate regime and suppresses scale drift without changing expressivity. These results establish a structural link between gauge-orbit geometry and optimization conditioning, providing a concrete connection between gauge-theoretic concepts and machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了离散扩散语言模型的扩展规律，比较了Masked、uniform-state和插值离散扩散方法，发现perplexity在跨方法比较中可能具有误导性，uniform-state扩散在GSM8K等任务上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不同离散扩散语言模型（如Masked、uniform-state和插值方法）的可扩展性与性能权衡，挑战仅以perplexity作为评估标准的现状。

Method: 开展首个针对uniform-state和插值离散扩散方法的扩展律研究；改进Masked扩散训练目标以提升FLOPs效率；在1.7B参数规模下对比各类模型在语言建模与下游任务（如GSM8K）上的表现。

Result: Masked扩散模型采用简单交叉熵目标可提升约12% FLOPs效率；perplexity在同族模型内有效，跨族时易误导；uniform-state扩散在GSM8K上超越自回归与Masked扩散模型，尽管其验证集perplexity更差。

Conclusion: Masked扩散并非离散扩散语言建模的唯一未来方向；评估应兼顾采样速度与质量（Pareto前沿），而非仅依赖perplexity。

Abstract: Diffusion language models are a promising alternative to autoregressive models due to their potential for faster generation. Among discrete diffusion approaches, Masked diffusion currently dominates, largely driven by strong perplexity on language modeling benchmarks. In this work, we present the first scaling law study of uniform-state and interpolating discrete diffusion methods. We also show that Masked diffusion models can be made approximately 12% more FLOPs-efficient when trained with a simple cross-entropy objective. We find that perplexity is informative within a diffusion family but can be misleading across families, where models with worse likelihood scaling may be preferable due to faster and more practical sampling, as reflected by the speed-quality Pareto frontier. These results challenge the view that Masked diffusion is categorically the future of diffusion language modeling and that perplexity alone suffices for cross-algorithm comparison. Scaling all methods to 1.7B parameters, we show that uniform-state diffusion remains competitive on likelihood-based benchmarks and outperforms autoregressive and Masked diffusion models on GSM8K, despite worse validation perplexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Horner因式分解多项式的极简参数神经网络架构，用于求解微分方程；通过构造性满足初始条件、残差配点训练及分段连续拼接策略，在仅需数十参数下实现高精度解及其导数逼近，显著优于同等参数量的MLP和正弦表征基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为在资源受限场景下实现科学建模的高精度与低参数平衡，解决传统神经网络求解微分方程时参数量大、训练效率低的问题。

Method: 采用Horner因式分解多项式构建隐式可微试探解，初始条件由低阶多项式自由度构造性满足；引入分段（类样条）扩展，多个小Horner模型在子区间上训练，并在边界处强制函数值与一阶导数连续。

Result: 在典型常微分方程基准和热方程示例中，仅需数十甚至更少参数的Horner网络即可高精度匹配真解及其导数，性能超越同训练设置下的小型MLP和正弦表示基线。

Conclusion: Horner网络实现了优异的精度-参数权衡，为轻量级、可微、物理信息嵌入的科学机器学习提供了实用新范式。

Abstract: We propose a parameter-minimal neural architecture for solving differential equations by restricting the hypothesis class to Horner-factorized polynomials, yielding an implicit, differentiable trial solution with only a small set of learnable coefficients. Initial conditions are enforced exactly by construction by fixing the low-order polynomial degrees of freedom, so training focuses solely on matching the differential-equation residual at collocation points. To reduce approximation error without abandoning the low-parameter regime, we introduce a piecewise ("spline-like") extension that trains multiple small Horner models on subintervals while enforcing continuity (and first-derivative continuity) at segment boundaries. On illustrative ODE benchmarks and a heat-equation example, Horner networks with tens (or fewer) parameters accurately match the solution and its derivatives and outperform small MLP and sinusoidal-representation baselines under the same training settings, demonstrating a practical accuracy-parameter trade-off for resource-efficient scientific modeling.

*Dhruva Karkada,Daniel J. Korchinski,Andres Nava,Matthieu Wyart,Yasaman Bahri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了语言统计中的平移对称性如何导致大语言模型中词嵌入呈现简单几何结构（如月份呈圆形排列），并证明这种结构在统计扰动和中等嵌入维度下仍具鲁棒性，其根源在于共现统计受连续潜在变量集体调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管学习表征是神经网络成功的基础，但其基本性质仍不清楚；特别是大语言模型中出现的简单几何结构（如月份呈圆形、年份呈一维流形）缺乏理论解释。

Method: 通过分析语言共现统计的平移对称性，建立其与高维词嵌入几何结构之间的数学联系，并从理论上证明该对称性如何导致特定几何结构；进一步提出并验证潜在连续变量调控共现统计的假设。

Result: 发现语言共现概率具有平移对称性（如两月份共现概率仅依赖时间间隔），该性质决定嵌入空间的几何结构；这些结构在强扰动（如删除含两月份的句子）和中等嵌入维数下仍稳健；实证验证该机制在词嵌入、文本嵌入及大语言模型中普遍存在。

Conclusion: 语言统计的平移对称性及其由连续潜在变量调控的本质，是理解大语言模型中涌现几何结构的关键原理，为表征学习提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Although learned representations underlie neural networks' success, their fundamental properties remain poorly understood. A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models.

*Jonathan Lys,Vincent Gripon,Bastien Pasdeloup,Lukas Mauch,Fabien Cardinaux,Ghouthi Boukli Hacene*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种推理时内循环（inner looping）方法，通过在预训练语言模型中重复应用选定的Transformer块范围，延长潜在表征的迭代精炼过程，在不改变模型参数的情况下提升了多个基准任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer等深度学习模型的层间残差连接暗示了潜在表征可通过多轮迭代精炼提升；已有工作推测某些层起精炼作用，但尚未系统探索推理时增加精炼步数的效果。

Method: 在推理阶段对预训练模型中选定的一组Transformer块进行多次循环调用（inner looping），即重复前向传播该块范围，以延长潜在表示的迭代优化过程。

Result: 在多个基准任务上实现了稳定但小幅的准确率提升；潜空间轨迹分析显示状态演化更稳定、语义持续精炼。

Conclusion: 冻结参数的预训练模型可通过简单的测试时计算扩展（即内循环）获得额外精炼能力，支持‘层共享潜在空间’与‘迭代精炼’的机制解释。

Abstract: Deep Learning architectures, and in particular Transformers, are conventionally viewed as a composition of layers. These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的元学习理论框架，定义了‘实用通用性’，并区分了算法显式与隐式学习；基于此，设计了名为TAIL的Transformer-based算法隐式元学习器，在跨域、跨模态及标签空间扩展方面展现出强泛化能力，并显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有元学习方法受限于狭窄的任务分布和固定特征/标签空间，且术语使用不一致、缺乏精确定义，阻碍了方法间的可比性与通用性发展。

Method: 构建元学习理论框架，形式化定义‘实用通用性’，区分算法显式与隐式学习；在此指导下提出TAIL模型：采用随机投影实现跨模态特征编码、随机注入标签嵌入以支持更大标签空间、以及高效内联查询处理。

Result: TAIL在标准少样本基准上达到SOTA；能跨域泛化；首次实现仅用图像训练却解决文本分类任务（跨模态泛化）；支持标签数达训练时20倍；计算开销比先前Transformer元学习器低数个数量级。

Conclusion: TAIL验证了所提理论框架的有效性，推动元学习向真正通用、跨模态、可扩展方向迈进，为统一评估和设计通用元学习器提供了新范式。

Abstract: Current meta-learning methods are constrained to narrow task distributions with fixed feature and label spaces, limiting applicability. Moreover, the current meta-learning literature uses key terms like "universal" and "general-purpose" inconsistently and lacks precise definitions, hindering comparability. We introduce a theoretical framework for meta-learning which formally defines practical universality and introduces a distinction between algorithm-explicit and algorithm-implicit learning, providing a principled vocabulary for reasoning about universal meta-learning methods. Guided by this framework, we present TAIL, a transformer-based algorithm-implicit meta-learner that functions across tasks with varying domains, modalities, and label configurations. TAIL features three innovations over prior transformer-based meta-learners: random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings that extrapolate to larger label spaces, and efficient inline query processing. TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard few-shot benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it also generalizes to unseen modalities, solving text classification tasks despite training exclusively on images, handles tasks with up to 20$\times$ more classes than seen during training, and provides orders-of-magnitude computational savings over prior transformer-based approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于机器学习的算法选择方法，通过轻量级MLP分类器预测组合拍卖中贪心算法在特定实例上的性能缺陷（即‘鲸鱼-鱼’陷阱结构），并在检测到难例时切换至异构图神经网络（GNN）求解器，从而构建混合分配器，在混合分布上实现0.51%的整体最优性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以可靠预测哪些组合拍卖实例会使快速贪心启发式失效；单纯用ML（如GNN）替代传统求解器效果不佳，因此转向学习‘何时’调用昂贵求解器的算法选择范式。

Method: 设计20维结构特征向量，训练轻量级MLP硬度分类器预测贪心算法的最优性差距；对被识别为难的实例（具‘鲸鱼-鱼’陷阱结构），启用异构GNN专用求解器；最终构建融合硬度分类器、GNN与贪心求解器的混合分配器。

Result: MLP分类器平均绝对误差0.033，Pearson相关系数0.937，二分类准确率94.7%；GNN在6种对抗配置下最优性差距≈0%（贪心为3.75–59.24%）；混合分配器在混合分布上整体差距为0.51%；在CATS基准上GNN未超越Gurobi（差距0.45–0.71 vs. 0.20）。

Conclusion: 学习‘何时’调用高成本求解器比学习‘完全替代’它们更可行且有效；算法选择框架优于端到端求解器替代，尤其在组合优化问题中具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: The Winner Determination Problem (WDP) in combinatorial auctions is NP-hard, and no existing method reliably predicts which instances will defeat fast greedy heuristics. The ML-for-combinatorial-optimization community has focused on learning to \emph{replace} solvers, yet recent evidence shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) rarely outperform well-tuned classical methods on standard benchmarks. We pursue a different objective: learning to predict \emph{when} a given instance is hard for greedy allocation, enabling instance-dependent algorithm selection. We design a 20-dimensional structural feature vector and train a lightweight MLP hardness classifier that predicts the greedy optimality gap with mean absolute error 0.033, Pearson correlation 0.937, and binary classification accuracy 94.7\% across three random seeds. For instances identified as hard -- those exhibiting ``whale-fish'' trap structure where greedy provably fails -- we deploy a heterogeneous GNN specialist that achieves ${\approx}0\%$ optimality gap on all six adversarial configurations tested (vs.\ 3.75--59.24\% for greedy). A hybrid allocator combining the hardness classifier with GNN and greedy solvers achieves 0.51\% overall gap on mixed distributions. Our honest evaluation on CATS benchmarks confirms that GNNs do not outperform Gurobi (0.45--0.71 vs.\ 0.20 gap), motivating the algorithm selection framing. Learning \emph{when} to deploy expensive solvers is more tractable than learning to replace them.

TL;DR: 本文研究了梯度下降（GD）和随机梯度下降（SGD）在训练过程中非线性动力学对稳定性的精确影响，提出了多变量情形下GD稳定振荡的高阶导数判据，并揭示SGD的稳定性可能由单个不稳定的batch主导，而非线性平均效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性化分析常被用于判断优化算法迭代的动力学稳定性，但其是否能准确反映真实非线性行为尚不明确；已有研究表明线性不稳定点仍可能实现稳定振荡或收敛，说明线性分析存在局限性。

Method: 推导多变量GD在极小点附近稳定振荡的精确非线性判据，依赖于高阶导数；将分析扩展至SGD，考察批量间非线性动态的期望行为，并给出保证SGD非线性稳定性的充分条件。

Result: 1) 得到GD稳定振荡的高阶导数精确判据；2) 揭示SGD的非线性动力学即使单个batch线性不稳定也可能导致整体期望发散；3) 证明若所有batch均线性稳定，则SGD非线性动力学在期望意义下稳定。

Conclusion: 非线性项对优化动力学稳定性具有决定性作用；线性稳定性分析不足以刻画实际训练行为，尤其在SGD中单个异常batch即可主导整体稳定性，需基于高阶信息进行更精细的稳定性评估。

Abstract: The dynamical stability of the iterates during training plays a key role in determining the minima obtained by optimization algorithms. For example, stable solutions of gradient descent (GD) correspond to flat minima, which have been associated with favorable features. While prior work often relies on linearization to determine stability, it remains unclear whether linearized dynamics faithfully capture the full nonlinear behavior. Recent work has shown that GD may stably oscillate near a linearly unstable minimum and still converge once the step size decays, indicating that linear analysis can be misleading. In this work, we explicitly study the effect of nonlinear terms. Specifically, we derive an exact criterion for stable oscillations of GD near minima in the multivariate setting. Our condition depends on high-order derivatives, generalizing existing results. Extending the analysis to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we show that nonlinear dynamics can diverge in expectation even if a single batch is unstable. This implies that stability can be dictated by a single batch that oscillates unstably, rather than an average effect, as linear analysis suggests. Finally, we prove that if all batches are linearly stable, the nonlinear dynamics of SGD are stable in expectation.

*Luuk Jacobs,Mohammad Ali Javidian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多源因果贝叶斯优化（MSCBO）方法，将多源贝叶斯优化（MSBO）与因果贝叶斯优化（CBO）相结合，以利用因果结构提升高维、多信息源场景下的优化效率与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多源贝叶斯优化假设输入变量独立同分布，无法利用因果信息；而因果贝叶斯优化虽能建模变量依赖，但仅限单源场景。现实问题（如临床试验、政策制定）常兼具多源性与因果性，亟需二者融合。

Method: 在理论层面统一CBO与MSBO框架，构建多源因果贝叶斯优化（MSCBO）算法，显式建模变量间的因果结构并融合多源异构信息（仿真、实验等），支持干预与反事实推理。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集（含不同噪声水平）上，MSCBO相比基础MSBO和CBO显著提升收敛速度、优化性能与可扩展性，并降低维度与运行成本。

Conclusion: 将因果性引入多源贝叶斯优化是有效且必要的，MSCBO通过因果驱动的维度约简与信息源协同，实现了更高效、鲁棒与低成本的黑箱优化。

Abstract: Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization (MSBO) serves as a variant of the traditional Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework applicable to situations involving optimization of an objective black-box function over multiple information sources such as simulations, surrogate models, or real-world experiments. However, traditional MSBO assumes the input variables of the objective function to be independent and identically distributed, limiting its effectiveness in scenarios where causal information is available and interventions can be performed, such as clinical trials or policy-making. In the single-source domain, Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) extends standard BO with the principles of causality, enabling better modeling of variable dependencies. This leads to more accurate optimization, improved decision-making, and more efficient use of low-cost information sources. In this article, we propose a principled integration of the MSBO and CBO methodologies in the multi-source domain, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance optimization efficiency and reduce computational complexity in higher-dimensional problems. We present the theoretical foundations of both Causal and Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization, and demonstrate how their synergy informs our Multi-Source Causal Bayesian Optimization (MSCBO) algorithm. We compare the performance of MSCBO against its foundational counterparts for both synthetic and real-world datasets with varying levels of noise, highlighting the robustness and applicability of MSCBO. Based on our findings, we conclude that integrating MSBO with the causality principles of CBO facilitates dimensionality reduction and lowers operational costs, ultimately improving convergence speed, performance, and scalability.

Motivation: 当前AI对齐方法（如RLHF、DPO）将安全目标与智能体策略纠缠，产生不可复用、不透明的‘对齐浪费’，缺乏可检验性与可维护性。

Method: 提出无交互逆强化学习（Interactionless IRL）解耦奖励建模与策略优化；设计含自动化审计与人工反馈的Alignment Flywheel迭代增强奖励模型。

Result: 生成可检查、可编辑、模型无关的奖励模型，并通过人类在环生命周期实现奖励模型的持续硬化与验证。

Abstract: AI alignment is growing in importance, yet current approaches suffer from a critical structural flaw that entangles the safety objectives with the agent's policy. Methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization create opaque, single-use alignment artifacts, which we term Alignment Waste. We propose Interactionless Inverse Reinforcement Learning to decouple alignment artifact learning from policy optimization, producing an inspectable, editable, and model-agnostic reward model. Additionally, we introduce the Alignment Flywheel, a human-in-the-loop lifecycle that iteratively hardens the reward model through automated audits and refinement.

Abstract: The traditional limitations of neural networks in reliably generalizing beyond the convex hulls of their training data present a significant problem for computational physics, in which one often wishes to solve PDEs in regimes far beyond anything which can be experimentally or analytically validated. In this paper, we show how it is possible to circumvent these limitations by constructing formally-verified neural network solvers for PDEs, with rigorous convergence, stability, and conservation properties, whose correctness can therefore be guaranteed even in extrapolatory regimes. By using the method of characteristics to predict the analytical properties of PDE solutions a priori (even in regions arbitrarily far from the training domain), we show how it is possible to construct rigorous extrapolatory bounds on the worst-case L^inf errors of shallow neural network approximations. Then, by decomposing PDE solutions into compositions of simpler functions, we show how it is possible to compose these shallow neural networks together to form deep architectures, based on ideas from compositional deep learning, in which the large L^inf errors in the approximations have been suppressed. The resulting framework, called BEACONS (Bounded-Error, Algebraically-COmposable Neural Solvers), comprises both an automatic code-generator for the neural solvers themselves, as well as a bespoke automated theorem-proving system for producing machine-checkable certificates of correctness. We apply the framework to a variety of linear and non-linear PDEs, including the linear advection and inviscid Burgers' equations, as well as the full compressible Euler equations, in both 1D and 2D, and illustrate how BEACONS architectures are able to extrapolate solutions far beyond the training data in a reliable and bounded way. Various advantages of the approach over the classical PINN approach are discussed.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于比较具有重叠簇和离群点的聚类结果的实用相似性度量方法，并验证了其优良性质和抗偏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有聚类比较方法无法有效处理包含离群点和/或重叠簇的聚类结果，缺乏适用于一般场景的评估手段。

Method: 定义了一种新的、适用于存在重叠簇和离群点情况下的聚类相似性度量，并分析其数学性质。

Result: 该度量具备若干理想性质，并在实验中表现出对常见聚类评估偏差（如簇数量依赖性）的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提出的相似性度量为复杂真实场景下的聚类外在评估提供了更合理、更稳健的工具。

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are an essential part of the unsupervised data science ecosystem, and extrinsic evaluation of clustering algorithms requires a method for comparing the detected clustering to a ground truth clustering. In a general setting, the detected and ground truth clusterings may have outliers (objects belonging to no cluster), overlapping clusters (objects may belong to more than one cluster), or both, but methods for comparing these clusterings are currently undeveloped. In this note, we define a pragmatic similarity measure for comparing clusterings with overlaps and outliers, show that it has several desirable properties, and experimentally confirm that it is not subject to several common biases afflicting other clustering comparison measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在大语言模型推理能力训练中面临稀疏奖励导致的样本效率低问题；传统课程学习难以确定适合特定模型的难度排序。

Method: 提出Goldilocks教师驱动的数据采样策略：教师模型基于学生模型在已见样本上的表现，动态预测并选择适中难度（既不太易也不太难）的问题，配合GRPO算法训练学生模型。

Result: 在OpenMathReasoning数据集上，Goldilocks在相同计算预算下优于标准GRPO训练方法。

Conclusion: Goldilocks能有效提升大语言模型推理训练的样本效率，体现了动态难度匹配对强化学习训练的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, relying on sparse rewards makes this process highly sample-inefficient, as models must navigate vast search spaces with minimal feedback. While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities. On OpenMathReasoning dataset, Goldilocks data sampling improves the performance of models trained with standard GRPO under the same compute budget.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been a main driver of recent breakthroughs in large reasoning models. Yet it remains a mystery how rewards based solely on final outcomes can help overcome the long-horizon barrier to extended reasoning. To understand this, we develop a theory of the training dynamics of RL for transformers on compositional reasoning tasks. Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains. As a technical contribution, our analysis develops and adapts tools from Fourier analysis on finite groups to our setting. We validate the predicted mechanisms empirically via synthetic experiments.

Abstract: We introduce Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization, a lightweight framework for generating summaries by combining retrieved text and image data from web sources. Given a user-defined topic, the system performs parallel web, news, and image searches. Retrieved images are ranked using a fine-tuned CLIP model to measure semantic alignment with topic and text. Optional BLIP captioning enables image-only summaries for stronger multimodal coherence.The pipeline supports features such as adjustable fetch limits, semantic filtering, summary styling, and downloading structured outputs. We expose the system via a Gradio-based API with controllable parameters and preconfigured presets.Evaluation on 500 image-caption pairs with 20:1 contrastive negatives yields a ROC-AUC of 0.9270, an F1-score of 0.6504, and an accuracy of 96.99%, demonstrating strong multimodal alignment. This work provides a configurable, deployable tool for web-scale summarization that integrates language, retrieval, and vision models in a user-extensible pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为何深度神经网络在训练后易于压缩（如剪枝、量化等），核心动机是探究其参数是否具有更低的算法复杂度（Kolmogorov复杂度）。

Method: 提出Mosaic-of-Motifs (MoMos) 方法：将参数分块，每块从预定义的k个可复用模块（motifs）中选取，形成受约束的参数化形式，以降低算法复杂度；使用Kolmogorov复杂度近似度量模型复杂性。

Result: 实验证明训练过程降低了神经网络参数的算法复杂度；MoMos生成的模型在保持性能的同时具有更低的算法复杂度。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络训练后的参数具有结构化和可重复性，导致其算法复杂度低于随机初始化，压缩方法本质上是利用并强化了这种低复杂度特性。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are well-suited for compression. Methods like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation have been used to achieve massive reductions in the number of model parameters, with marginal performance drops across a variety of architectures and tasks. This raises the central question: \emph{Why are deep neural networks suited for compression?} In this work, we take up the perspective of algorithmic complexity to explain this behavior. We hypothesize that the parameters of trained models have more structure and, hence, exhibit lower algorithmic complexity compared to the weights at (random) initialization. Furthermore, that model compression methods harness this reduced algorithmic complexity to compress models. Although an unconstrained parameterization of model weights, $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, can represent arbitrary weight assignments, the solutions found during training exhibit repeatability and structure, making them algorithmically simpler than a generic program. To this end, we formalize the Kolmogorov complexity of $\mathbf{w}$ by $\mathcal{K}(\mathbf{w})$. We introduce a constrained parameterization $\widehat{\mathbf{w}}$, that partitions parameters into blocks of size $s$, and restricts each block to be selected from a set of $k$ reusable motifs, specified by a reuse pattern (or mosaic). The resulting method, $\textit{Mosaic-of-Motifs}$ (MoMos), yields algorithmically simpler model parameterization compared to unconstrained models. Empirical evidence from multiple experiments shows that the algorithmic complexity of neural networks, measured using approximations to Kolmogorov complexity, can be reduced during training. This results in models that perform comparably with unconstrained models while being algorithmically simpler.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在分布偏移下如何通过伪校准（pseudo-calibration）提升共形预测（CP）的覆盖率保证，并提出了一个源域调优的伪校准算法，在保持预测集大小的同时缓解覆盖率下降。

Result: 理论推导出目标域覆盖率下界；数值实验表明所提界限能定性刻画伪校准行为，且源域调优方案可有效缓解覆盖率下降，同时保持非平凡的预测集大小。

Conclusion: 伪校准是提升共形预测在分布偏移下鲁棒性的有效手段，结合源域信息调优可兼顾覆盖率保障与预测集实用性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) offers distribution-free marginal coverage guarantees under an exchangeability assumption, but these guarantees can fail if the data distribution shifts. We analyze the use of pseudo-calibration as a tool to counter this performance loss under a bounded label-conditional covariate shift model. Using tools from domain adaptation, we derive a lower bound on target coverage in terms of the source-domain loss of the classifier and a Wasserstein measure of the shift. Using this result, we provide a method to design pseudo-calibrated sets that inflate the conformal threshold by a slack parameter to keep target coverage above a prescribed level. Finally, we propose a source-tuned pseudo-calibration algorithm that interpolates between hard pseudo-labels and randomized labels as a function of classifier uncertainty. Numerical experiments show that our bounds qualitatively track pseudo-calibration behavior and that the source-tuned scheme mitigates coverage degradation under distribution shift while maintaining nontrivial prediction set sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图神经网络（如BHyGNN）在异配性超图上表现受限，且依赖标注数据，难以适用于真实场景中标签稀缺的情况。

Method: 提出BHyGNN+，利用超图对偶性进行结构变换（节点与超边角色互换），通过对比原始超图与其对偶超图的增强视图（使用余弦相似度），实现无监督表征学习；该方法无需构造负样本。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上的实验表明，BHyGNN+在异配与同配超图上均持续优于当前最优的有监督和自监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 超图对偶性是有效的自监督学习机制，为无标签复杂超图的表征学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Hypergraph Neural Networks (HyGNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling higher-order relationships among entities. However, their performance often degrades on heterophilic hypergraphs, where nodes connected by the same hyperedge tend to have dissimilar semantic representations or belong to different classes. While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs. Our results validate the effectiveness of leveraging hypergraph duality for self-supervised learning and establish a new paradigm for representation learning on challenging, unlabeled hypergraphs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为方差缩减无学习（VRU）的新算法，首次在保证(ε,δ)-无学习的前提下，将遗忘集梯度直接纳入一阶优化更新中，并在理论和实验上均展现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有(ε,δ)-无学习方法要么仅用遗忘集校准噪声而未利用其梯度信息，要么虽经验性地使用遗忘样本但缺乏理论保证；本文旨在弥合理论严谨性与实际有效性之间的鸿沟。

Method: 提出方差缩减无学习（VRU）算法，将遗忘集梯度显式引入一阶更新规则，并结合方差缩减技术确保(ε,δ)-无学习性质；同时给出收敛性分析及误差界比较。

Result: VRU是首个兼具理论保证（满足(ε,δ)-无学习）与直接利用遗忘集梯度的一阶算法；理论证明其收敛率严格优于不使用遗忘集的现有方法，尤其在低误差区域具有渐近优势；实验验证其在多个基准上一致优于SOTA认证方法和经验基线。

Conclusion: VRU成功统一了无学习中的理论保障与实用效率，表明显式建模遗忘集可带来本质性提升，为未来无学习算法设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: In machine unlearning, $(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning is a popular framework that provides formal guarantees on the effectiveness of the removal of a subset of training data, the forget set, from a trained model. For strongly convex objectives, existing first-order methods achieve $(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning, but they only use the forget set to calibrate injected noise, never as a direct optimization signal. In contrast, efficient empirical heuristics often exploit the forget samples (e.g., via gradient ascent) but come with no formal unlearning guarantees. We bridge this gap by presenting the Variance-Reduced Unlearning (VRU) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, VRU is the first first-order algorithm that directly includes forget set gradients in its update rule, while provably satisfying ($(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning. We establish the convergence of VRU and show that incorporating the forget set yields strictly improved rates, i.e. a better dependence on the achieved error compared to existing first-order $(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning methods. Moreover, we prove that, in a low-error regime, VRU asymptotically outperforms any first-order method that ignores the forget set.Experiments corroborate our theory, showing consistent gains over both state-of-the-art certified unlearning methods and over empirical baselines that explicitly leverage the forget set.

Conclusion: 通过引入自适应机制，多目标在线学习可有效实现局部自适应，兼顾多个公平与准确性目标，为动态环境下的可信机器学习提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We consider the general problem of learning a predictor that satisfies multiple objectives of interest simultaneously, a broad framework that captures a range of specific learning goals including calibration, regret, and multiaccuracy. We work in an online setting where the data distribution can change arbitrarily over time. Existing approaches to this problem aim to minimize the set of objectives over the entire time horizon in a worst-case sense, and in practice they do not necessarily adapt to distribution shifts. Earlier work has aimed to alleviate this problem by incorporating additional objectives that target local guarantees over contiguous subintervals. Empirical evaluation of these proposals is, however, scarce. In this article, we consider an alternative procedure that achieves local adaptivity by replacing one part of the multi-objective learning method with an adaptive online algorithm. Empirical evaluations on datasets from energy forecasting and algorithmic fairness show that our proposed method improves upon existing approaches and achieves unbiased predictions over subgroups, while remaining robust under distribution shift.

Motivation: 现有因果基础模型（CFMs）无法融入领域知识，导致预测次优；需提升其对因果先验信息的利用能力。

Method: 提出多种条件化策略，重点将可学习偏差注入注意力机制，以融合完整或部分因果信息（如因果图、祖先关系）。

Conclusion: 所提方法解决了CFM难以整合领域知识的关键瓶颈，推动了数据驱动与专家知识协同的‘一站式’因果基础模型发展。

Abstract: Estimating causal quantities traditionally relies on bespoke estimators tailored to specific assumptions. Recently proposed Causal Foundation Models (CFMs) promise a more unified approach by amortising causal discovery and inference in a single step. However, in their current state, they do not allow for the incorporation of any domain knowledge, which can lead to suboptimal predictions. We bridge this gap by introducing methods to condition CFMs on causal information, such as the causal graph or more readily available ancestral information. When access to complete causal graph information is too strict a requirement, our approach also effectively leverages partial causal information. We systematically evaluate conditioning strategies and find that injecting learnable biases into the attention mechanism is the most effective method to utilise full and partial causal information. Our experiments show that this conditioning allows a general-purpose CFM to match the performance of specialised models trained on specific causal structures. Overall, our approach addresses a central hurdle on the path towards all-in-one causal foundation models: the capability to answer causal queries in a data-driven manner while effectively leveraging any amount of domain expertise.

TL;DR: 本文提出MacroGuide，一种基于持续同调的拓扑引导机制，用于提升预训练分子生成模型（尤其是扩散模型）生成大环化合物的能力，在无条件和蛋白口袋条件生成任务中均显著提高大环生成率（从1%提升至99%），同时保持高化学有效性、多样性与对接合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大环化合物具有高选择性和强结合能力，但因公共数据稀缺及标准生成模型难以满足其环状拓扑约束，其在生成建模中仍被严重低估。

Method: 提出MacroGuide：在扩散模型去噪每一步中，基于原子坐标构建Vietoris-Rips复形，利用持续同调特征（特别是1维持久圈）引导环结构生成，实现对大环拓扑的显式优化；支持无条件生成与蛋白口袋条件生成。

Result: 将MacroGuide应用于预训练扩散模型后，大环生成率从1%跃升至99%，且在化学有效性、分子多样性、PoseBusters对接验证等关键指标上达到或超越当前最优方法。

Conclusion: Persistent Homology可作为强效、可插拔的拓扑先验，有效弥补生成模型在复杂分子拓扑建模上的不足；MacroGuide为大环药物发现提供了高效、通用的新范式。

Abstract: Macrocycles are ring-shaped molecules that offer a promising alternative to small-molecule drugs due to their enhanced selectivity and binding affinity against difficult targets. Despite their chemical value, they remain underexplored in generative modeling, likely owing to their scarcity in public datasets and the challenges of enforcing topological constraints in standard deep generative models. We introduce MacroGuide: Topological Guidance for Macrocycle Generation, a diffusion guidance mechanism that uses Persistent Homology to steer the sampling of pretrained molecular generative models toward the generation of macrocycles, in both unconditional and conditional (protein pocket) settings. At each denoising step, MacroGuide constructs a Vietoris-Rips complex from atomic positions and promotes ring formation by optimizing persistent homology features. Empirically, applying MacroGuide to pretrained diffusion models increases macrocycle generation rates from 1% to 99%, while matching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance on key quality metrics such as chemical validity, diversity, and PoseBusters checks.

Conclusion: 显式建模多模态信息的全部谱系（冗余、独特、协同）可获得更稳定、可靠和全面的嵌入表示。

Abstract: Multimodal learning seeks to integrate information from heterogeneous sources, where signals may be shared across modalities, specific to individual modalities, or emerge only through their interaction. While self-supervised multimodal contrastive learning has achieved remarkable progress, most existing methods predominantly capture redundant cross-modal signals, often neglecting modality-specific (unique) and interaction-driven (synergistic) information. Recent extensions broaden this perspective, yet they either fail to explicitly model synergistic interactions or learn different information components in an entangled manner, leading to incomplete representations and potential information leakage. We introduce \textbf{COrAL}, a principled framework that explicitly and simultaneously preserves redundant, unique, and synergistic information within multimodal representations. COrAL employs a dual-path architecture with orthogonality constraints to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, ensuring a clean separation of information components. To promote synergy modeling, we introduce asymmetric masking with complementary view-specific patterns, compelling the model to infer cross-modal dependencies rather than rely solely on redundant cues. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and diverse MultiBench datasets demonstrate that COrAL consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting low performance variance across runs. These results indicate that explicitly modeling the full spectrum of multimodal information yields more stable, reliable, and comprehensive embeddings.

Due to the demand that arises from application-related data, there is a need to identify further topological and geometric structures with which these use cases can be made accessible to machine learning. There are various techniques, such as spectral convolution, that form the basic building blocks for some convolutional neural network-like architectures on non-Euclidean data. In this paper, the concept of spectral convolution on orbifolds is introduced. This provides a building block for making learning on orbifold structured data accessible using GDL. The theory discussed is illustrated using an example from music theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Boundary Point Jailbreaking（BPJ）的新型全自动黑盒 jailbreak 攻击方法，仅依赖单比特反馈（是否被检测），通过构建中间攻击目标序列和主动选择边界点来优化攻击，成功绕过当前最强的宪法分类器（Constitutional Classifiers）及GPT-5输入分类器，且无需人工种子；其防御难点在于单次交互难以察觉，但优化过程会产生大量告警，提示需结合批处理级监控进行防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分类器的LLM防护机制经受了大量红队测试，但缺乏对真正黑盒、全自动、无需先验知识（如梯度或已有攻击模板）的攻击方法的有效评估；需探索更本质的攻击优化机制以揭示真实防御脆弱性。

Method: BPJ采用全黑盒设定，仅利用每次查询的二元输出（是否被分类器标记）；它将目标有害字符串转化为渐进式中间攻击目标序列，并主动选取对攻击强度变化最敏感的‘边界点’作为评估点，从而在无梯度、无分数反馈下高效优化攻击提示。

Result: BPJ首次实现了全自动、通用型jailbreak，成功攻破行业部署的宪法分类器与GPT-5输入分类器，且不依赖人工构造的攻击种子；实验表明其在单次交互中隐蔽性强，但优化阶段触发大量分类器告警。

Conclusion: BPJ揭示了当前单次交互式分类器防御范式的根本局限，表明有效防御需从单轮响应转向跨批次行为监控；该工作为评估与提升LLM安全护栏的鲁棒性提供了新基准与思路。

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are safeguarded against attempts to extract harmful information via adversarial prompts known as "jailbreaks". Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength ("boundary points"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于偏微分方程（PDE）预训练的基础模型Poseidon，将其扩展至三维并用于构建火星大气天气模拟器，在数据稀疏和算力受限条件下展现出显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对火星大气建模中训练数据不足、计算资源有限以及物理过程复杂等问题，探索利用PDE基础模型迁移学习能力构建高效天气模拟器。

Method: 基于二维Poseidon PDE基础模型，提出一种保持预训练知识的三维扩展方法，并在稀疏初始条件下进行微调；使用约34 GB、覆盖四个火星年的数值模拟数据进行训练。

Result: 在预留一年数据上的预测性能较基线提升34.4%；仅需中位13 GPU小时计算量，验证了PDE基础模型在真实复杂系统建模中的有效性。

Conclusion: PDE基础模型不仅能逼近其他PDE解，还可作为现实世界复杂系统的锚定模型，尤其适用于数据与算力受限场景。

Abstract: We show that AI foundation models that are pretrained on numerical solutions to a diverse corpus of partial differential equations can be adapted and fine-tuned to obtain skillful predictive weather emulators for the Martian atmosphere. We base our work on the Poseidon PDE foundation model for two-dimensional systems. We develop a method to extend Poseidon from two to three dimensions while keeping the pretraining information. Moreover, we investigate the performance of the model in the presence of sparse initial conditions. Our results make use of four Martian years (approx.~34 GB) of training data and a median compute budget of 13 GPU hours. We find that the combination of pretraining and model extension yields a performance increase of 34.4\% on a held-out year. This shows that PDEs-FMs can not only approximate solutions to (other) PDEs but also anchor models for real-world problems with complex interactions that lack a sufficient amount of training data or a suitable compute budget.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于连续时间马尔可夫链（CTMC）的离散空间扩散模型的采样效率，重点分析τ-leaping采样器在均匀和掩码噪声过程下的KL散度收敛性，提出了与维度相关但摆脱词表大小依赖的收敛界，并引入‘有效总相关性’刻画结构化数据下的自适应收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散空间扩散模型虽经验成功，但理论基础尚不完善，尤其缺乏对采样效率的严格分析；现有方法常依赖词表大小S，难以适用于大词汇场景。

Method: 采用连续时间马尔可夫链（CTMC）建模离散扩散过程，理论分析τ-leaping采样器在均匀与掩码噪声下的KL收敛性；引入‘有效总相关性’作为掩码扩散的内在信息度量，并建立无光滑性/有界性假设的收敛保证（仅需控制分数估计的熵损失）。

Result: 1）均匀扩散下，τ-leaping迭代复杂度为Õ(d/ε)，消除对词表大小S的线性依赖，且证明d的线性依赖不可改进；2）掩码扩散下，新τ-leaping变体的收敛率由‘有效总相关性’主导，该量可远小于d log S（如HMM、图像、随机图中呈次线性或常数级），实现无需先验知识的结构自适应；3）所有结论均无需分数估计的有界性或光滑性假设。

Conclusion: 本文为离散扩散模型提供了首个摆脱词表规模限制、适配低维结构的理论框架，揭示了τ-leaping采样器在离散空间中的本质效率边界与自适应机制，推动其在大规模、结构化离散数据上的可靠应用。

Abstract: Diffusion models over discrete spaces have recently shown striking empirical success, yet their theoretical foundations remain incomplete. In this paper, we study the sampling efficiency of score-based discrete diffusion models under a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) formulation, with a focus on $τ$-leaping-based samplers. We establish sharp convergence guarantees for attaining $\varepsilon$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for both uniform and masking noising processes. For uniform discrete diffusion, we show that the $τ$-leaping algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of order $\tilde O(d/\varepsilon)$, with $d$ the ambient dimension of the target distribution, eliminating linear dependence on the vocabulary size $S$ and improving existing bounds by a factor of $d$; moreover, we establish a matching algorithmic lower bound showing that linear dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable in general. For masking discrete diffusion, we introduce a modified $τ$-leaping sampler whose convergence rate is governed by an intrinsic information-theoretic quantity, termed the effective total correlation, which is bounded by $d \log S$ but can be sublinear or even constant for structured data. As a consequence, the sampler provably adapts to low-dimensional structure without prior knowledge or algorithmic modification, yielding sublinear convergence rates for various practical examples (such as hidden Markov models, image data, and random graphs). Our analysis requires no boundedness or smoothness assumptions on the score estimator beyond control of the score entropy loss.

TL;DR: 本文提出canonicalization方法，通过将样本映射到对称群轨道代表元，在规范切片上训练非等变扩散或流模型，再通过随机对称变换恢复不变分布，理论证明其正确性、普适性和更强表达力，并在3D分子生成任务中显著优于等变基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过架构约束（如等变去噪器和不变先验）强制实现对称不变性，本文挑战该范式，提出基于规范化的替代视角以提升生成模型性能。

Method: 采用规范化的思路：先将每个样本映射到对称群轨道的代表元（规范姿态或顺序），在规范子集上训练无约束（非等变）扩散或流模型，生成时采样随机对称变换以恢复不变分布；结合商空间理论，引入几何谱规范化与轻量位置编码，并融合对齐先验与最优传输提升训练效率。

Result: 在Sn×SE(3)对称下的分子图生成任务中，canonical diffusion显著优于等变基线，计算开销相当甚至更低；新架构CanonFlow在GEOM-DRUG数据集上达到SOTA，且在少步生成中优势明显。

Conclusion: canonicalization不仅理论上具有正确性、普适性与更高表达能力，还能加速训练、降低条件方差，是生成具有对称不变性科学数据的有效新范式。

Abstract: Many generative tasks in chemistry and science involve distributions invariant to group symmetries (e.g., permutation and rotation). A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出PAPerBench基准，系统评估上下文长度对大语言模型个性化效果与隐私泄露的影响，发现上下文越长，二者性能均下降，并从注意力稀释角度给出理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在隐私敏感与个性化场景中广泛应用，但上下文长度对隐私泄露与个性化效果的影响尚不明确。

Method: 构建大规模基准PAPerBench（含约29,000个样本，上下文长度1K–256K tokens，共377K评测问题），联合评估个性化质量与隐私风险；结合实证评测与软注意力机制下的理论分析（注意力稀释）。

Result: 在多个SOTA LLM上验证：上下文增长导致个性化性能与隐私保护能力同步下降；理论分析表明这是固定容量Transformer中软注意力的固有局限。

Conclusion: 当前模型存在‘长上下文、低聚焦’的通用缩放缺口；PAPerBench开源以支持可复现评估与未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in privacy-critical and personalization-oriented scenarios, yet the role of context length in shaping privacy leakage and personalization effectiveness remains largely unexplored. We introduce a large-scale benchmark, PAPerBench, to systematically study how increasing context length influences both personalization quality and privacy protection in LLMs. The benchmark comprises approximately 29,000 instances with context lengths ranging from 1K to 256K tokens, yielding a total of 377K evaluation questions. It jointly evaluates personalization performance and privacy risks across diverse scenarios, enabling controlled analysis of long-context model behavior. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal consistent performance degradation in both personalization and privacy as context length increases. We further provide a theoretical analysis of attention dilution under context scaling, explaining this behavior as an inherent limitation of soft attention in fixed-capacity Transformers. The empirical and theoretical findings together suggest a general scaling gap in current models -- long context, less focus. We release the benchmark to support reproducible evaluation and future research on scalable privacy and personalization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/PAPerBench
