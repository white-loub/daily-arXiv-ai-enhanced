However, this physical dispersion constrains agents to limited local perception and finite temporal horizons. We characterize this bottleneck as spatiotemporal partial observability. Given such fragmented awareness, distributed agents struggle to coordinate efficiently. To bridge this gap, we introduce MACRO-LLM, LLM-empowered multi-agent collaborative reasoning under spatiotemporal partial observability. The architecture addresses spatiotemporal constraints via three modules: (1) the CoProposer mitigates temporal uncertainty by verifying candidate actions via predictive rollouts; (2) the Negotiator overcomes spatial myopia by resolving conflicts through mean-field statistical aggregation; and (3) the Introspector ensures continuous adaptation by analyzing historical experience to refine strategies via semantic gradient descent. Extensive evaluations on two complex long-horizon tasks, cooperative adaptive cruise control and pandemic control, demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates spatiotemporal partial observability through spatial and temporal strategies, enabling robust coordination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMACRO-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CoProposer\u3001Negotiator\u548cIntrospector\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5de1\u822a\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u75ab\u60c5\u7ba1\u63a7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u91ce\uff0c\u5373\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u534f\u8c03\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMACRO-LLM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a(1) CoProposer\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u63a8\u6f14\u7f13\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b(2) Negotiator\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u5747\u573a\u7edf\u8ba1\u805a\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u7a7a\u95f4\u77ed\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\uff1b(3) Introspector\u6a21\u5757\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bed\u4e49\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b56\u7565\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u534f\u540c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5de1\u822a\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u75ab\u60c5\u7ba1\u63a7\u4e24\u4e2a\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cMACRO-LLM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u534f\u540c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "MACRO-LLM\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u534f\u5546\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent MAS routing methods aim to balance performance and overhead by dynamically selecting agent roles and language models. However, these approaches typically rely on a homogeneous collaboration mode, where all agents follow the same interaction pattern, limiting collaboration flexibility across different roles. Motivated by Social Capital Theory, which emphasizes that different roles benefit from distinct forms of collaboration, we propose SC-MAS, a framework for constructing heterogeneous and cost-efficient multi-agent systems. SC-MAS models MAS as directed graphs, where edges explicitly represent pairwise collaboration strategies, allowing different agent pairs to interact through tailored communication patterns. Given an input query, a unified controller progressively constructs an executable MAS by selecting task-relevant agent roles, assigning edge-level collaboration strategies, and allocating appropriate LLM backbones to individual agents. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-MAS. In particular, SC-MAS improves accuracy by 3.35% on MMLU while reducing inference cost by 15.38%, and achieves a 3.53% accuracy gain with a 12.13% cost reduction on MBPP. These results validate the feasibility of SC-MAS and highlight the effectiveness of heterogeneous collaboration in multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSC-MAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u53d7\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u8272\u5e94\u9002\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u534f\u4f5c\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSC-MAS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u8fb9\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u6210\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u7531\u7edf\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u5206\u914d\u8fb9\u7ea7\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5404\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u914d\u5408\u9002\u7684LLM\u5e95\u5ea7\u3002", "result": "\u5728MMLU\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53473.35%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e15.38%\uff1b\u5728MBPP\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53473.53%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e12.13%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6784\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0cSC-MAS\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u601d\u8def\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

In robotic applications, although intuitions about fairness are common, a precise and implementable definition that captures user utility and inherent data randomness is missing. Here we provide a utility-aware fairness metric for robotic decision making and analyze fairness jointly with user-data privacy, deriving conditions under which privacy budgets govern fairness metrics. This yields a unified framework that formalizes and quantifies fairness and its interplay with privacy, which is tested in a robot navigation task. In view of the fact that under legal requirements, most robotic systems will enforce user privacy, the approach shows surprisingly that such privacy budgets can be jointly used to meet fairness targets.

An emerging and critical challenge is how to identify conceptually relevant prior work from rapidly growing literature, and assess how a new idea differentiates from existing research. Current embedding approaches typically conflate distinct conceptual aspects into single representations and cannot support fine-grained literature retrieval; meanwhile, LLM-based evaluators are subject to sycophancy biases, failing to provide discriminative novelty assessment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Ideation Space, a structured representation that decomposes scientific knowledge into three distinct dimensions, i.e., research problem, methodology, and core findings, each learned through contrastive training. This framework enables principled measurement of conceptual distance between ideas, and modeling of ideation transitions that capture the logical connections within a proposed idea. Building upon this representation, we propose a Hierarchical Sub-Space Retrieval framework for efficient, targeted literature retrieval, and a Decomposed Novelty Assessment algorithm that identifies which aspects of an idea are novel. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements, where our approach achieves Recall@30 of 0.329 (16.7% over baselines), our ideation transition retrieval reaches Hit Rate@30 of 0.643, and novelty assessment attains 0.37 correlation with expert judgments.

This method often produces visual artifacts known as floaters--nearly transparent, disconnected elements that drift in space away from the actual surface. This geometric inaccuracy undermines the reliability of these models for practical applications, which is critical. To address this issue, we introduce TIDI-GS, a new training framework designed to eliminate these floaters. A key benefit of our approach is that it functions as a lightweight plugin for the standard 3DGS pipeline, requiring no major architectural changes and adding minimal overhead to the training process. The core of our method is a floater pruning algorithm--TIDI--that identifies and removes floaters based on several criteria: their consistency across multiple viewpoints, their spatial relationship to other elements, and an importance score learned during training. The framework includes a mechanism to preserve fine details, ensuring that important high-frequency elements are not mistakenly removed. This targeted cleanup is supported by a monocular depth-based loss function that helps improve the overall geometric structure of the scene.

Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark.

However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regularization. EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models. The proposed method provides more interpretable and consistent explanations across all exit points, making early-exit networks more suitable for explainable AI applications in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faExplanation-Guided Training\uff08EGT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u5c42\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u65e9\u671f\u51fa\u53e3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6df1\u5c42\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEGT\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f7f\u65e9\u671f\u51fa\u53e3\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u51fa\u53e3\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cEGT\u8fbe\u523098.97%\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6301\u5e73\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.97\u500d\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe18.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "EGT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002"}}

However, precise scene understanding and sample-efficient learning from human demonstrations remain critical challenges, severely hindering the applicability and generalizability of existing frameworks. This paper presents a novel RGMP-S, Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy with Spiking features, facilitating both high-level skill reasoning and data-efficient motion synthesis. To ground high-level reasoning in physical reality, we leverage lightweight 2D geometric inductive biases to enable precise 3D scene understanding within the vision-language model. Specifically, we construct a Long-horizon Geometric Prior Skill Selector that effectively aligns the semantic instructions with spatial constraints, ultimately achieving robust generalization in unseen environments. For the data efficiency issue in robotic action generation, we introduce a Recursive Adaptive Spiking Network. We parameterize robot-object interactions via recursive spiking for spatiotemporal consistency, fully distilling long-horizon dynamic features while mitigating the overfitting issue in sparse demonstration scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted across the Maniskill simulation benchmark and three heterogeneous real-world robotic systems, encompassing a custom-developed humanoid, a desktop manipulator, and a commercial robotic platform. Empirical results substantiate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines and validate the efficacy of the proposed modules in diverse generalization scenarios.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, existing benchmarks inadequately assess performance on action-based tasks involving threshold evaluation, temporal aggregation, and conditional logic. We introduce ART, an Action-based Reasoning clinical Task benchmark for medical AI agents, which mines real-world EHR data to create challenging tasks targeting known reasoning weaknesses. Through analysis of existing benchmarks, we identify three dominant error categories: retrieval failures, aggregation errors, and conditional logic misjudgments. Our four-stage pipeline -- scenario identification, task generation, quality audit, and evaluation -- produces diverse, clinically validated tasks grounded in real patient data. Evaluating GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on 600 tasks shows near-perfect retrieval after prompt refinement, but substantial gaps in aggregation (28--64%) and threshold reasoning (32--38%).

We propose Variable Basis Mapping (VBM), a framework that transforms volumetric fields into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations through wavelet-domain analysis. First, we precompute a compact Wavelet-to-Gaussian Transition Bank that provides optimal Gaussian surrogates for canonical wavelet atoms across multiple scales. Second, we perform analytical Gaussian construction that maps discrete wavelet coefficients directly to 3DGS parameters using a closed-form, mathematically principled rule. Finally, a lightweight image-space fine-tuning stage further refines the representation to improve rendering fidelity.

This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization.

This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.\n  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches. SGFMs offer a principled path toward long-range coherence, multimodal generality, and physically structured inductive bias in next-generation generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9891\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff08SGFMs\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u89c6\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Transformer\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u573a\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57fa\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6d41\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "SGFMs\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u957f\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u53ca\u5185\u5d4c\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "SGFMs\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u539f\u7406\u6027\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u624e\u6839\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u7a81\u7834\u5f53\u524d\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

This review critically examines the intersection of PTSD and chronic illnesses as expressed on social media platforms. By systematically analyzing literature from 2008 to 2024, the study explores how PTSD manifests and is managed in individuals with chronic conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders, with a focus on online expressions on platforms like X (formally known as Twitter) and Facebook. Findings demonstrate that social media data offers valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by individuals with both PTSD and chronic illnesses. Specifically, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques can identify potential PTSD cases among these populations, achieving accuracy rates between 74% and 90%. Furthermore, the role of online support communities in shaping coping strategies and facilitating early interventions is highlighted.

Most existing soft grippers are pneumatically actuated with several hundred kPa pressure, and cannot generate output force sufficient for such a large and heavy object. Instead of pneumatic actuation, hydraulic actuation has a potential to generate much larger power by several MPa pressure. In this study, we develop a hydraulically-driven soft gripper, in which its basic design parameters are determined based on a mathematical model that represents the relationship among the driving pressure, bending angle, object mass and grasping force. Moreover, we selected materials suitable for grasping a heavier object, based on the finite element analysis result of the detailed design.

However, their embeddings are typically high-dimensional, leading to substantial storage and retrieval overhead. Although recent approaches such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) alleviate these issues to some extent, they still suffer from retrieval accuracy degradation. This paper proposes \\emph{Isolation Kernel Embedding} or IKE, a learning-free method that transforms an LLM embedding into a binary embedding using Isolation Kernel (IK). IKE is an ensemble of diverse (random) partitions, enabling robust estimation of ideal kernel in the LLM embedding space, thus reducing retrieval accuracy loss as the ensemble grows.

We demonstrate that adding construction steps between the designer's input geometry and the final profile improves generation quality in a similar way to the introduction of a chain of thought in language models. Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision.

These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.\n  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods.

A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%. While the R-squared remains modest, consistent with the noisy nature of financial returns, primary emphasis is placed on relative error reduction and directional prediction. Feature importance analysis and visual inspection further enhance interpretability. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient boosting ensembles in modeling nonlinear dynamics in volatile emerging market time series and establish a reproducible benchmark for NEPSE Index forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eXGBoost\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u80a1\u5e02\uff08NEPSE\uff09\u6307\u6570\u65e5\u5bf9\u6570\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u8d85\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfARIMA\u548c\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\uff08\u5982\u5c3c\u6cca\u5c14\u80a1\u5e02\uff09\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528XGBoost\u56de\u5f52\u5668\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b30\u5929\u6ede\u540e\u5bf9\u6570\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u53caRSI\u3001\u6eda\u52a8\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Optuna\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u6eda\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u524d\u5411\u6eda\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u6837\u672c\u5916\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u6269\u5c55\u7a97\u53e3+20\u9636\u6ede\u540e\uff09\u5728\u5bf9\u6570\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f4eRMSE\uff080.013450\uff09\u548cMAE\uff080.009814\uff09\uff0c\u65b9\u5411\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe65.15%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eARIMA\u548cRidge\u56de\u5f52\uff1bR\u00b2\u867d\u4f4e\u4f46\u7b26\u5408\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aNEPSE\u6307\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce Adversarial Tales, a jailbreak technique that embeds harmful content within cyberpunk narratives and prompts models to perform functional analysis inspired by Vladimir Propp's morphology of folktales. By casting the task as structural decomposition, the attack induces models to reconstruct harmful procedures as legitimate narrative interpretation. Across 26 frontier models from nine providers, we observe an average attack success rate of 71.3%, with no model family proving reliably robust. Together with our prior work on Adversarial Poetry, these findings suggest that structurally-grounded jailbreaks constitute a broad vulnerability class rather than isolated techniques. The space of culturally coded frames that can mediate harmful intent is vast, likely inexhaustible by pattern-matching defenses alone. Understanding why these attacks succeed is therefore essential: we outline a mechanistic interpretability research agenda to investigate how narrative cues reshape model representations and whether models can learn to recognize harmful intent independently of surface form.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6545\u4e8b'\uff08Adversarial Tales\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578bLLM\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d5b\u535a\u670b\u514b\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u666e\u7f57\u666e\u6c11\u95f4\u6545\u4e8b\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf7\u6c42\u4f2a\u88c5\u6210\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u572826\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe71.3%\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u662f\u4e00\u7c7b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5f00\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ebf\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u6613\u53d7\u5229\u7528\u6587\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u6784\u6709\u5bb3\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u6b64\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d8a\u72f1\u7684\u6839\u672c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdversarial Tales\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u5d4c\u5165\u8d5b\u535a\u670b\u514b\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u666e\u7f57\u666e\u6c11\u95f4\u6545\u4e8b\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u2018\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u89e3\u2019\u5f0f\u529f\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3a\u6b63\u5f53\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002", "result": "\u572826\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea9\u5bb6\u5382\u5546\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe71.3%\uff0c\u65e0\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u524dAdversarial Poetry\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8d8a\u72f1\u6784\u6210\u4e00\u7c7b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d8a\u72f1\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u9632\u5fa1\u96be\u4ee5\u7a77\u5c3d\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ebf\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose Cross-Embodiment Interface (\\CEI), a framework for cross-embodiment learning that enables the transfer of demonstrations across different robot arm and end-effector morphologies. \\CEI introduces the concept of \\textit{functional similarity}, which is quantified using Directional Chamfer Distance. Then it aligns robot trajectories through gradient-based optimization, followed by synthesizing observations and actions for unseen robot arms and end-effectors.

Bridging Sparse and Dense Models", "comment": "25 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) remains the cornerstone of modern recommender systems, with dense embedding--based methods dominating current practice. However, these approaches suffer from a critical limitation: our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ceiling when modeling unpopular items, where parameter-based dense models experience diminishing SNR under severe data sparsity. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SaD (Sparse and Dense), a unified framework that integrates the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the structural reliability of sparse interaction patterns. We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, SaD is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of existing recommender models, highlighting the enduring power of collaborative filtering when leveraged from dual perspectives. Further evaluations on real-world benchmarks show that SaD consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first on the BarsMatch leaderboard.

This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHACHI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08CPMs\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u53cd\u590d\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u7684\u6d77\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u843d\u5730\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHACHI\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff1aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u7684\u5019\u9009\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u662f/\u5426\u95ee\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u6982\u5ff5\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u7c92\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u53ca\u504f\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6025\u6027\u80be\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u521b\u4f24\u6027\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cHACHI\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u4e0e\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u5f15\u5bfcAI\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u4fee\u6b63\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e34\u5e8a\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "HACHI\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86AI\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6709\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Accepted for publication by the 14th international conference on Computational Visual Media (CVM 2026)", "summary": "Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness.

Promotions shift, consumer preferences evolve, and supply disruptions alter demand patterns, causing what is known as concept drift. This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle. The system combines an ensemble of four complementary detection methods, namely error-based monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoder anomaly detection, and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point analysis, with hierarchical propagation analysis to identify exactly where drift occurs across product lines. Once detected, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis diagnoses the root causes, and a cost-aware retraining strategy selectively updates only the most affected models. Evaluated on over 30,000 time series from the M5 retail dataset, DriftGuard achieves 97.8% detection recall within 4.2 days and delivers up to 417 return on investment through targeted remediation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDriftGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u6790\u3001SHAP\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728M5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e0e\u663e\u8457ROI\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u4fc3\u9500\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u504f\u597d\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u4f9b\u5e94\u4e2d\u65ad\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5b66\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6839\u56e0\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u6a21\u5757DriftGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u96c6\u6210\u56db\u7c7b\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u8bef\u5dee\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u3001\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001CUSUM\u53d8\u70b9\u5206\u6790\uff09+ \u5206\u5c42\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u6790\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6f02\u79fb\u4f4d\u7f6e + SHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u6839\u56e0 + \u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728M5\u96f6\u552e\u6570\u636e\u96c63\u4e07\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c4.2\u5929\u5185\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe97.8%\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u51c6\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8417\u500d\u6295\u8d44\u56de\u62a5\u7387\uff08ROI\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "DriftGuard\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u96f6\u552e\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7ef4\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This mismatch substantially limits the real-world applicability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL systems. To bridge this gap, we explore a database-centric approach that leverages intrinsic, fine-grained information residing in relational databases to construct missing evidence and improve Text-to-SQL accuracy under annotation-scarce conditions. Our key hypothesis is that when a query requires multi-step reasoning over extensive table information, existing methods often struggle to reliably identify and utilize the truly relevant knowledge. We therefore propose to \"cache\" query-relevant knowledge on the database side in advance, so that it can be selectively activated at inference time. Based on this idea, we introduce Companion Agents (CA), a new Text-to-SQL paradigm that incorporates a group of agents accompanying database schemas to proactively mine and consolidate hidden inter-table relations, value-domain distributions, statistical regularities, and latent semantic cues before query generation. Experiments on BIRD under the fully missing evidence setting show that CA recovers +4.49 / +4.37 / +14.13 execution accuracy points on RSL-SQL / CHESS / DAIL-SQL, respectively, with larger gains on the Challenging subset +9.65 / +7.58 / +16.71.

For example, a driver must perceive the road ahead to anticipate available friction and plan actions accordingly. Achieving such proactive adaptation within autonomous frameworks remains a challenge, particularly under rapidly changing conditions. Traditional modeling approaches often struggle to capture abrupt variations in system behavior, while adaptive methods are inherently reactive and may adapt too late to ensure safety. We propose a vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that leverages visual context to anticipate changes in the environment. The model first learns nominal vehicle dynamics and is then fine-tuned with feature-wise affine transformations of latent features, enabling context-aware dynamics prediction.

While large language models (LLMs) can now provide exceptional capabilities that model user behavior for sequential recommendation tasks, their substantial memory footprint and computational overhead make the deployment on resource-constrained devices a high risk proposition. In this paper, we propose OD-LLM, the first task-adaptive compression framework explicitly designed to provide efficient and accurate on-device deployment of LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. OD-LLM uniquely integrates two complementary compression strategies: a low-rank structural compression algorithm which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to significantly reduce parameter redundancy in the model, and a novel tokenization normalization technique that better complements the low-rank decomposition process being used. Additionally, to minimize any potential performance degradation when using higher compression ratios, a novel progressive alignment algorithm is used to iteratively refine the parameters required layerwise in the target model. Empirical evaluations conducted on sequential recommendation benchmarks show that OD-LLM exhibits no loss in effectiveness when compared to the original recommendation model, when the deployed model size is halved. These promising results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of OD-LLM, making this novel solution a practical alternative for real-time, on-device solutions wishing to replace expensive, remotely executed LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOD-LLM\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7aef\u4fa7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\uff08SVD\uff09\u4e0e\u65b0\u578btoken\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef\u51cf\u534a\u65f6\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u96f6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u7aef\u4fa7\u63a8\u8350\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LLM\u56e0\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOD-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eSVD\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5197\u4f59\uff1b2\uff09\u65b0\u578btokenization normalization\u6280\u672f\u534f\u540c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\uff1b3\uff09\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u9010\u5c42\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cOD-LLM\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef\u51cf\u534a\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u65e0\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "OD-LLM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7aef\u4fa7LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u4e91\u7aefLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7aef\u4fa7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset.

Pilot feasibility study using public-access large language models without API-level orchestration", "summary": "This paper presents a tri-agent cross-validation framework for analyzing stability and explainability in multi-model large language systems. The architecture integrates three heterogeneous LLMs-used for semantic generation, analytical consistency checking, and transparency auditing-into a recursive interaction cycle. This design induces Recursive Knowledge Synthesis (RKS), where intermediate representations are continuously refined through mutually constraining transformations irreducible to single-model behavior. Across 47 controlled trials using public-access LLM deployments (October 2025), we evaluated system stability via four metrics: Reflex Reliability Score (RRS), Transparency Score (TS), Deviation Detection Rate (DDR), and Correction Success Rate (CSR). The system achieved mean RRS = 0.78+-0.06 and maintained TS >= 0.8 in about 68% of trials. Approximately 89% of trials converged, supporting the theoretical prediction that transparency auditing acts as a contraction operator within the composite validation mapping. The contributions are threefold: (1) a structured tri-agent framework for coordinated reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs, (2) a formal RKS model grounded in fixed-point theory, and (3) empirical evaluation of inter-model stability under realistic, non-API public-access conditions. These results provide initial empirical evidence that a safety-preserving, humansupervised multi-LLM architecture can achieve stable recursive knowledge synthesis in realistic, publicly deployed environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784LLM\u534f\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9012\u5f52\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u6210\uff08RKS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u572847\u6b21\u516c\u5f00\u90e8\u7f72\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u591aLLM\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e09\u7c7b\u5f02\u6784LLM\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u9012\u5f52\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u6210\uff08RKS\uff09\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56db\u9879\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08RRS\u3001TS\u3001DDR\u3001CSR\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u572847\u6b21\u516c\u5f00LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747RRS\u8fbe0.78\u00b10.06\uff0c\u7ea668%\u8bd5\u9a8cTS\u22650.8\uff0c89%\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u5408\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6620\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u9012\u5f52\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u591aLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u907f\uff0c\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u5bf9\u51f8\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u5f62\u72b6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u51f8\uff09\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u65e0\u4fdd\u5b88\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u907f\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u6c42\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5747\u4e3a\u51f8\u96c6\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u3001\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\uff1b\u63a8\u5e7f\u5206\u79bb\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u6709\u754c\u95ed\u96c6\u53ef\u88ab\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08NLP\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u975e\u51f8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u4e14\u654f\u6377\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u5c11\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u907f\u969c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs.

We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively.

We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach.

Entity-level unlearning addresses this issue by removing all knowledge of a specific entity while preserving the model's overall capabilities. Existing approaches typically rely on full-model fine-tuning or prompt-based interventions, which can be computationally expensive or brittle when handling paraphrased queries. Recently, model editing has emerged as an efficient alternative for updating knowledge in LLMs, offering a promising direction for unlearning. However, existing editing techniques are typically designed for instance-level updates, modifying responses to specific attributes of an entity rather than eliminating all knowledge associated with the entity. In this paper, we investigate how editing techniques can be adapted for effective and efficient entity-level unlearning. To this end, we introduce a novel consistency-aware editing (CAE) framework. CAE aggregates a diverse set of prompts related to a target entity, including its attributes, relations, and adversarial paraphrases. It then jointly learns a low-rank update guided by a consistency regularizer that aligns the editing directions across prompts. This promotes robust and comprehensive forgetting while minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. We further examine where different entities are stored within the model and how many diverse prompts are needed for successful unlearning. We evaluate CAE on two challenging benchmarks, RWKU and ToFU, and demonstrate that it (i) provides insights into how entity-level knowledge is internally represented and deleted in LLMs, (ii) significantly improves forgetting accuracy and robustness over traditional unlearning and editing baselines, and (iii) enables scalable entity removal using only tens of carefully selected prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u8f91\uff08CAE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u5220\u9664\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u6216\u5bf9\u6539\u5199\u67e5\u8be2\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5df2\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5f7b\u5e95\u6d88\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u8f91\uff08CAE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u805a\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6539\u5199\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u53d7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5728RWKU\u548cToFU\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CAE\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u5fd8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5b9e\u4f53\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4ec5\u9700\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u5220\u9664\u3002", "conclusion": "CAE\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u5411\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Lu"], "title": "Dissecting Judicial Reasoning in U.S. Copyright Damage Awards", "comment": "Presented in SIGKDD'25 SciSoc LLM Workshop: Large Language Models for Scientific and Societal Advances", "summary": "Judicial reasoning in copyright damage awards poses a core challenge for computational legal analysis. Although federal courts follow the 1976 Copyright Act, their interpretations and factor weightings vary widely across jurisdictions. This inconsistency creates unpredictability for litigants and obscures the empirical basis of legal decisions. This research introduces a novel discourse-based Large Language Model (LLM) methodology that integrates Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) with an agentic workflow to extract and quantify previously opaque reasoning patterns from judicial opinions. Our framework addresses a major gap in empirical legal scholarship by parsing opinions into hierarchical discourse structures and using a three-stage pipeline, i.e., Dataset Construction, Discourse Analysis, and Agentic Feature Extraction. This pipeline identifies reasoning components and extract feature labels with corresponding discourse subtrees. In analyzing copyright damage rulings, we show that discourse-augmented LLM analysis outperforms traditional methods while uncovering unquantified variations in factor weighting across circuits.

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AviationLMM\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6c11\u7528\u822a\u7a7a\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u96f7\u8fbe\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56AI\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u822a\u7a7aAI\u65b9\u6848\u5b64\u7acb\u3001\u5355\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u96f7\u8fbe\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u5f31\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAviationLMM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u7a7a\u5730\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u76d1\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u3001\u673a\u8f7d\u9065\u6d4b\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u6001\u52bf\u6458\u8981\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u8b66\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u91cd\u5efa\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u878d\u5408\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86AviationLMM\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u84dd\u56fe\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u96c6\u6210\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u822a\u7a7aAI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5f15\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "AviationLMM\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u822a\u7a7aAI\u4ece\u5b64\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u5411\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u6c11\u7528\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5168\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage.

However, little is known about the energy scaling laws in ML, and existing research focuses on training cost -- ignoring the larger cost of inference. Furthermore, tools for measuring the energy consumption of ML do not provide actionable feedback.\n  To address these gaps, we developed Energy Consumption Optimiser (ECOpt): a hyperparameter tuner that optimises for energy efficiency and model performance. ECOpt quantifies the trade-off between these metrics as an interpretable Pareto frontier. This enables ML practitioners to make informed decisions about energy cost and environmental impact, while maximising the benefit of their models and complying with new regulations.\n  Using ECOpt, we show that parameter and floating-point operation counts can be unreliable proxies for energy consumption, and observe that the energy efficiency of Transformer models for text generation is relatively consistent across hardware. These findings motivate measuring and publishing the energy metrics of ML models. We further show that ECOpt can have a net positive environmental impact and use it to uncover seven models for CIFAR-10 that improve upon the state of the art, when considering accuracy and energy efficiency together.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aECOpt\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u80fd\u91cf\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8017\u6307\u6807\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9ML\u80fd\u91cf\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Energy Consumption Optimiser\uff08ECOpt\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u91cf\u5316\u4e8c\u8005\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548cFLOPs\u5e76\u975e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff1bTransformer\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\uff1bECOpt\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e867\u4e2a\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u65b0SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u91cd\u89c6\u5e76\u89c4\u8303ML\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8017\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u516c\u5f00\uff0cECOpt\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u73af\u5883\u6b63\u5411\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63a8\u52a8\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u7eff\u8272AI\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this study, we explore how structured knowledge, specifically, subject-predicate-object triples, can enhance the clustering and classification of scientific papers. We propose a modular pipeline that combines unsupervised clustering and supervised classification over multiple document representations: raw abstracts, extracted triples, and hybrid formats that integrate both. Using a filtered arXiv corpus, we extract relational triples from abstracts and construct four text representations, which we embed using four state-of-the-art transformer models: MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, and SPECTER. We evaluate the resulting embeddings with KMeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised clustering, and fine-tune classification models for arXiv subject prediction. Our results show that full abstract text yields the most coherent clusters, but that hybrid representations incorporating triples consistently improve classification performance, reaching up to 92.6% accuracy and 0.925 macro-F1. We also find that lightweight sentence encoders (MiniLM, MPNet) outperform domain-specific models (SciBERT, SPECTER) in clustering, while SciBERT excels in structured-input classification.

Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits.

Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as \"diversity\" or \"debiasing\", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias.

This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9690\u5f0f\u3001\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e09\u7c7b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6574\u5408\u53ca\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM/MLLM\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8f6c\u5411\u5177\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u6210\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u68b3\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08\u9690\u5f0f/\u663e\u5f0f/\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u4e09\u5927\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027taxonomy\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5404\u7c7b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5178\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u534f\u540c\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5f53\u524dbenchmark\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bb0\u5fc6\u662fLLM/MLLM\u5411\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6f14\u8fdb\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u878d\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6-\u63a8\u7406\u534f\u540c\u3001\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002"}}

While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5411MoE\u8def\u7531\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6269\u6563Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758fMoE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff08\u5982\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u6267\u884c\u5668\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5404\u4e13\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u663e\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165MoE\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u5f62\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5206\u5de5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains. In summary, the framework generates counterfactual explanations that are both valid and physically consistent, while laying the foundation for scalable counterfactual generation in big data environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65e2\u6709\u6548\u53c8\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ea6\u675f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eSEP\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5DTW\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83DiCE\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cDTW\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8580%\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd150%\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5177\u5907\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

For such systems to function in interactive settings, models must be able to incorporate externally provided confidence information into their verbal responses. In this work, we test whether instruction-tuned language models preserve this controllability across different interaction modes.\n  Using Llama-3.2-3B on GSM8K, we perform a causal intervention study in which explicit external confidence signals are injected and model compliance is measured under multiple prompt strategies. We find that base models exhibit near-perfect controllability (Spearman rho close to 1.0), while instruction-tuned models display a striking context dependence: they fully comply with external corrections under explicit command prompts (bias approximately 0 percent, rho = 0.93), yet systematically ignore the same signals in natural conversational queries (bias plus 40 percent, rho = 0.04).\n  This behavior is not a capability failure; the model can process the signal, but an emergent property of RLHF optimization that prioritizes conversational fluency over external calibration cues in natural dialogue. We further show that internal token-level confidence in small models is uninformative (r = 0.035), underscoring the necessity of external supervision. Our findings highlight a deployment-critical failure mode: the interaction style users expect is precisely where safety corrections are least effective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5ffd\u7565\u5916\u90e8\u5b89\u5168\u6821\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u660e\u786e\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u5219\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u9075\u5faa\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fRLHF\u4f18\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6743\u8861\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u7ea0\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5916\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u5426\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728GSM8K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9Llama-3.2-3B\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u5c55\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5411\u5176\u6ce8\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u5916\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u663e\u5f0f\u547d\u4ee4 vs \u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff09\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff08\u7528Spearman rho\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\uff08rho\u22481.0\uff09\uff1b\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u547d\u4ee4\u4e0b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5408\u89c4\uff08rho=0.93\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u22480%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4e25\u91cd\u5931\u7075\uff08\u504f\u5dee+40%\uff0crho=0.04\uff09\uff1b\u4e14\u5176\u5185\u90e8token\u7ea7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6781\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff08r=0.035\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fRLHF\uff09\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u800c\u727a\u7272\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u6821\u51c6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u98ce\u9669\u2014\u2014\u7528\u6237\u6700\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u6070\u6070\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u6700\u5931\u6548\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Their complementary roles motivate a unified modeling paradigm. Early studies to unify S&R adopt shared encoders with task-specific heads, while recent efforts reframe item ranking in both S&R as conditional generation. The latter holds particular promise, enabling end-to-end optimization and leveraging the semantic understanding of LLMs. However, existing methods rely on full fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and limits scalability. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers a more practical alternative but faces two critical challenges in unifying S&R: (1) gradient conflicts across tasks due to divergent optimization objectives, and (2) shifts in user intent understanding caused by overfitting to fine-tuning data, which distort general-domain knowledge and weaken LLM reasoning. To address the above issues, we propose Gradient Multi-Subspace Tuning (GEMS), a novel framework that unifies S&R with LLMs while alleviating gradient conflicts and preserving general-domain knowledge. GEMS introduces (1) \\textbf{Multi-Subspace Decomposition}, which disentangles shared and task-specific optimization signals into complementary low-rank subspaces, thereby reducing destructive gradient interference, and (2) \\textbf{Null-Space Projection}, which constrains parameter updates to a subspace orthogonal to the general-domain knowledge space, mitigating shifts in user intent understanding. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that GEMS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across both search and recommendation tasks, achieving superior effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGEMS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u4e0b\u7edf\u4e00\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u800c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u504f\u79fb\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGradient Multi-Subspace Tuning\uff08GEMS\uff09\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u591a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u2014\u2014\u5c06\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8026\u81f3\u4e92\u8865\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u2014\u2014\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGEMS\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GEMS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5\u7684LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4fdd\u7559\u3002"}}

It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures. This consistency points to shared geometric characteristics of the loss landscapes of old and new nonconvex problems, and hints to future research questions around the geometry of high dimensional optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83WSD\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728Pythia\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cCIFAR10\u5c0fCNN\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8c\u8005\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5c16\u9510\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5171\u901a\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76WSD\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8eTransformer\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u53cd\u6620\u66f4\u666e\u9002\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790WSD\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0bAdam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728Pythia-like\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eCIFAR10\u5c0fCNN\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u7387\uff08sharpness\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728WSD\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5b9a\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5176\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u5177\u6709\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "WSD\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6709\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5171\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, their reliability as automated judges in rubric-based settings requires rigorous assessment. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of LLM-judges for rubric-based short-answer grading. We investigate three key aspects: the alignment of LLM grading with expert judgment across varying rubric complexities, the trade-off between uncertainty and accuracy facilitated by a consensus-based deferral mechanism, and the model's robustness under random input perturbations and adversarial attacks. Using the SciEntsBank benchmark and Qwen 2.5-72B, we find that alignment is strong for binary tasks but degrades with increased rubric granularity. Our \"Trust Curve\" analysis demonstrates a clear trade-off where filtering low-confidence predictions improves accuracy on the remaining subset. Additionally, robustness experiments reveal that while the model is resilient to prompt injection, it is sensitive to synonym substitutions. Our work provides critical insights into the capabilities and limitations of rubric-conditioned LLM judges, highlighting the importance of uncertainty estimation and robustness testing for reliable deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u77ed\u7b54\u6848\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u5458\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u8bc4\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7ec6\u5316\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u4fe1\u4efb\u66f2\u7ebf\u2019\u63ed\u793a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5269\u4f59\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u77ed\u7b54\u6848\u8bc4\u5206\uff08ASAG\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u5b66\u751f\u56de\u7b54\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ca\u9700\u4f9d\u636e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7ed9\u4e88\u7ec6\u81f4\u90e8\u5206\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u5458\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSciEntsBank\u57fa\u51c6\u548cQwen 2.5-72B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a1\uff09LLM\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u673a\u5236\u6240\u4f53\u73b0\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "1\uff09LLM\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u8bc4\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u8bc4\u5206\u7c92\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b2\uff09\u2018\u4fe1\u4efb\u66f2\u7ebf\u2019\u663e\u793a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5269\u4f59\u5b50\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b3\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "rubric-conditioned LLM\u8bc4\u5206\u5458\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u5fc5\u987b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

However, since this recipe updates existing representations, it is unsuitable for long-term operation in the real world, where robots must continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining the knowledge they have already acquired. Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning a new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods.

However, real-world information needs often require reasoning about temporal evolution and synthesizing evidence across time periods. We introduce TEMPO, the first benchmark combining temporal reasoning with reasoning-intensive retrieval across 13 domains. TEMPO features: (1) 1,730 complex queries requiring deep temporal reasoning such as tracking changes, identifying trends, or comparing cross-period evidence; (2) step-wise retrieval planning with 3,976 decomposed steps and gold documents mapped to each step for multi-hop evaluation; and (3) novel temporal metrics including Temporal Coverage@k and Temporal Precision@k measuring whether results span required time periods. Evaluation of 12 retrieval systems reveals substantial challenges: the best model (DiVeR) achieves only 32.0 NDCG@10 and 71.4\\% Temporal Coverage@10, demonstrating difficulty in retrieving temporally complete evidence. We believe TEMPO provides a challenging benchmark for improving temporal reasoning in retrieval and RAG systems. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tempo-bench/Tempo.

While computer vision (CV) is proofed for automated quality control, existing models are often static, rendering them ineffective in dynamic manufacturing environments. These models typically cannot detect new, unseen defect classes, be efficiently updated from scarce data, or adapt to new part geometries. To address this gap, this paper presents an adaptive CV framework for the entire life-cycle of quality model maintenance. The proposed framework is built upon a same, scale-robust backbone model and integrates three key methodologies: (1) a statistical hypothesis testing framework based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for novelty detection, (2) a two-stage, rehearsal-based strategy for few-shot incremental learning, and (3) a few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for few-shot domain adaptation. The framework was evaluated on a TPL dataset featuring hemisphere as source domain and cube as target domain structures, with each domain categorized into good, minor damaged, and damaged quality classes. The hypothesis testing method successfully identified new class batches with 99-100% accuracy. The incremental learning method integrated a new class to 92% accuracy using only K=20 samples. The domain adaptation model bridged the severe domain gap, achieving 96.19% accuracy on the target domain using only K=5 shots. These results demonstrate a robust and data-efficient solution for deploying and maintaining CV models in evolving production scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5149\u523b\uff08TPL\uff09\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e09\u5927\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u65b0\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CV\u8d28\u68c0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u96f6\u4ef6\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\uff08LDA\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b(2) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u653e\u5f0f\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b(3) \u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DANN\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u534a\u7403\uff08\u6e90\u57df\uff09\u4e0e\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u57df\uff09\u7684TPL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u738799\u2013100%\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528K=20\u6837\u672c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u8fbe92%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528K=5\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u8fbe96.19%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684CV\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u7ef4\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \\textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains.

While leveraging abundant Human-Human Interaction (HHI) data presents a scalable alternative, we first demonstrate that standard retargeting fails by breaking the essential contacts. We address this with PAIR (Physics-Aware Interaction Retargeting), a contact-centric, two-stage pipeline that preserves contact semantics across morphology differences to generate physically consistent HHoI data. This high-quality data, however, exposes a second failure: conventional imitation learning policies merely mimic trajectories and lack interactive understanding. We therefore introduce D-STAR (Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Action Reasoner), a hierarchical policy that disentangles when to act from where to act. In D-STAR, Phase Attention (when) and a Multi-Scale Spatial module (where) are fused by the diffusion head to produce synchronized whole-body behaviors beyond mimicry. By decoupling these reasoning streams, our model learns robust temporal phases without being distracted by spatial noise, leading to responsive, synchronized collaboration. We validate our framework through extensive and rigorous simulations, demonstrating significant performance gains over baseline approaches and a complete, effective pipeline for learning complex whole-body interactions from HHI data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPAIR\uff08\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u4ea4\u4e92\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\uff09\u548cD-STAR\uff08\u89e3\u8026\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u5668\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba-\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HHoI\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0e\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7406\u89e3\u4e24\u5927\u74f6\u9888\uff1aPAIR\u901a\u8fc7\u63a5\u89e6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684HHoI\u6570\u636e\uff1bD-STAR\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u2018\u4f55\u65f6\u884c\u52a8\u2019\uff08\u76f8\u4f4d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u4e0e\u2018\u4f55\u5904\u884c\u52a8\u2019\uff08\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5757\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u5934\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\u5168\u8eab\u534f\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "1\uff09\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba-\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HHoI\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u53d1\u5c55\uff1b2\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4eba-\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HHI\uff09\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5173\u952e\u63a5\u89e6\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b3\uff09\u5373\u4f7f\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfHHoI\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u8f68\u8ff9\u6a21\u4eff\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4ea4\u4e92\u672c\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u6027\uff09\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "1\uff09PAIR\uff1a\u63a5\u89e6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u5f62\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u63a5\u89e6\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2\uff09D-STAR\uff1a\u5206\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u2018Phase Attention\u2019\uff08\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u4f4d\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u4e0e\u2018Multi-Scale Spatial module\u2019\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u7531\u6269\u6563\u5934\u878d\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u540c\u6b65\u5168\u8eab\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4eceHHI\u6570\u636e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u5168\u8eab\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u54cd\u5e94\u8fc5\u901f\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u4eceHHI\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfHHoI\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u9a71\u52a8\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff1aPAIR\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u74f6\u9888\uff0cD-STAR\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u534f\u540c\u6784\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684HHoI\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, existing spatiotemporal retrieval methods are often extensions of conventional vector search systems that rely on external filters or specialized indices to incorporate temporal and spatial constraints, leading to inefficiency, architectural complexity, and limited flexibility in handling heterogeneous modalities. To overcome these challenges, we present a unified spatiotemporal vector retrieval framework that integrates temporal, spatial, and semantic cues within a coherent similarity space while maintaining scalability and adaptability to continuous data streams. Specifically, we propose (1) a Rotary-based Unified Encoding Method that embeds time and location into rotational position vectors for consistent spatiotemporal representation; (2) a Circular Incremental Update Mechanism that supports efficient sliding-window updates without global re-encoding or index reconstruction; and (3) a Weighted Interest-based Retrieval Algorithm that adaptively balances modality weights for context-aware and personalized retrieval. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while maintaining robustness under dynamic data evolution. These results highlight the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach for scalable spatiotemporal information retrieval in intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u73af\u5f62\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u5174\u8da3\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u5411\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u6216\u4e13\u7528\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u65cb\u8f6c\u5411\u91cf\uff1b(2) \u73af\u5f62\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u9ad8\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b(3) \u52a0\u6743\u5174\u8da3\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our lookahead strategy and tool usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMAXS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6536\u655b\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3LLM Agent\u5728\u591a\u5de5\u5177\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u77ed\u89c6\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM Agent\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u77ed\u89c6\uff08\u7f3a\u4e4f\u524d\u77bb\uff09\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u65e9\u671f\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u5f15\u53d1\u8def\u5f84\u53d1\u6563\uff09\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5168\u5c40\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5143\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u6846\u67b6MAXS\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5411\u524d\u6269\u5c55\u51e0\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6b65\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u8d8b\u52bf\u659c\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b3\uff09\u8f68\u8ff9\u6536\u655b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe\u6210\u65f6\u7ec8\u6b62 rollout \u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08MiMo-VL-7B\u3001Qwen2.5-VL-7B\u3001Qwen2.5-VL-32B\uff09\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMAXS\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MAXS\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u655b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3LLM Agent\u591a\u5de5\u5177\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Schroder"], "title": "Layer-Parallel Training for Transformers", "comment": "20 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "We present a new training methodology for transformers using a multilevel, layer-parallel approach. Through a neural ODE formulation of transformers, our application of a multilevel parallel-in-time algorithm for the forward and backpropagation phases of training achieves parallel acceleration over the layer dimension. This dramatically enhances parallel scalability as the network depth increases, which is particularly useful for increasingly large foundational models. However, achieving this introduces errors that cause systematic bias in the gradients, which in turn reduces convergence when closer to the minima. We develop an algorithm to detect this critical transition and either switch to serial training or systematically increase the accuracy of layer-parallel training.

We introduce InftyThink with Cross-Chain Memory, an extension that augments iterative reasoning with an embedding-based semantic cache of previously successful reasoning patterns. At each reasoning step, the model retrieves and conditions on the most semantically similar stored lemmas, guiding inference without expanding the context window indiscriminately. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that semantic lemma retrieval improves accuracy in structured domains while exposing failure modes in tests that include heterogeneous domains. Geometric analyses of reasoning trajectories reveal that cache retrieval induces directional biases in embedding space, leading to consistent fix (improve baseline accuracy) and break (degradation in baseline accuracy) attractors.

The scale of this data and its unstructured format still continue to grow requiring ever more robust automated extraction and retrieval mechanisms. Existing work, leveraging the web pages Document Object Model (DOM), often derives clustering vectors from coordinates informed by the DOM such as visual placement or tree structure. The construction and component value of these vectors often go unexamined. Our work proposes and examines DOM coordinates in a detail to understand their impact on web page segmentation. Our work finds that there is no one-size-fits-all vector, and that visual coordinates under-perform compared to DOM coordinates by about 20-30% on average. This challenges the necessity of including visual coordinates in clustering vectors. Further, our work finds that simple vectors, comprised of single coordinates, fare better than complex vectors constituting 68.2% of the top performing vectors of the pages examined. Finally, we find that if a vector, clustering algorithm, and page are properly matched, one can achieve overall high segmentation accuracy at 74%. This constitutes a 20% improvement over a naive application of vectors.

However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain. This granularity gap manifests in two limitations: inference inefficiency from redundant exploration without explicit guidance, and optimization difficulty due to sparse outcome supervision or costly external verifiers. In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that CoT-Flow achieves a superior balance between inference efficiency and reasoning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoT-Flow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u6d41\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u6b65\u5bf9\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6574\u4f53\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6bcf\u6b65\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u96be\uff08\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoT-Flow\uff1a\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u6d41\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u8d2a\u5fc3\u89e3\u7801\uff08flow-guided decoding\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08flow-based RL\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCoT-Flow\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u523b\u753b\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods.

This approach enables deterministic scoring and scalable evaluation without human annotation or reference models, and contamination resistance through regenerable corpora. Our evaluation of 33 models using over 21 billion tokens reveals that context length claims frequently exceed usable capacity, with significant degradation beyond 32K tokens; cross-document aggregation proves substantially harder than single-document extraction; and grounding ability and hallucination resistance are distinct capabilities - models excelling at finding facts that exist may still fabricate facts that do not. Beyond the specific benchmark, we contribute a domain-agnostic methodology for constructing scalable and contamination-resistant evaluations wherever synthetic documents can be generated from structured ground truth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRIKER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5df2\u77e5\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6587\u6863\uff08\u800c\u975e\u4ece\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u6297\u6c61\u67d3\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9762\u4e34\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6613\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u3001LLM\u88c1\u5224\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRIKER\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8303\u5f0f\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u5373\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002", "result": "\u5bf933\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8d85210\u4ebftoken\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u5ba3\u79f0\u5e38\u8d85\u51fa\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u7528\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0832K\u540e\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff1b\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u805a\u5408\u8fdc\u96be\u4e8e\u5355\u6587\u6863\u62bd\u53d6\uff1b grounding\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6297\u5e7b\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u72ec\u7acb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RIKER\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6297\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u80fd\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6587\u6863\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Many real-world queries contain multimodal elements, particularly, images such as diagrams, charts, and screenshots that require intensive reasoning to identify relevant documents. To address this gap, we introduce MM-BRIGHT, the first multimodal benchmark for reasoning-intensive retrieval. Our dataset consists of 2,803 real-world queries spanning 29 diverse technical domains, with four tasks of increasing complexity: text-to-text, multimodal-to-text, multimodal-to-image, and multimodal-to-multimodal retrieval. Extensive evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art models struggle across all tasks: BM25 achieves only 8.5 nDCG@10 on text-only retrieval, while the best multimodal model Nomic-Vision reaches just 27.6 nDCG@10 on multimodal-to-text retrieval actually underperforming the best text-only model (DiVeR: 32.2). These results highlight substantial headroom and position MM-BRIGHT as a testbed for next-generation retrieval models that better integrate visual reasoning.

However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states.

We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model.

The core challenges lie in accurately imputing missing views without introducing bias, while maintaining semantic consistency across views and compactness within clusters. To address these challenges, we propose DIMVC-HIA, a novel deep IMVC framework that integrates hierarchical imputation and alignment with four key components: (1) view-specific autoencoders for latent feature extraction, coupled with a view-shared clustering predictor to produce soft cluster assignments; (2) a hierarchical imputation module that first estimates missing cluster assignments based on cross-view contrastive similarity, and then reconstructs missing features using intra-view, intra-cluster statistics; (3) an energy-based semantic alignment module, which promotes intra-cluster compactness by minimizing energy variance around low-energy cluster anchors; and (4) a contrastive assignment alignment module, which enhances cross-view consistency and encourages confident, well-separated cluster predictions.

Our two-stage training pipeline first uses supervised fine-tuning to teach structured chain-of-thought reasoning, and then applies a GRPO-based alignment stage to reinforce logical consistency, domain expertise, and empathetic caregiving strategies. We further design an evaluation framework comprising temperament-sensitive multiple-choice tests and human assessments. The results demonstrate that PediaMind-R1 can accurately interpret early childhood temperament profiles and proactively engage in individualized reasoning.

The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks.

The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods.

While activation steering has emerged as a parameter efficient alternative, existing methods apply static, manual interventions that fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of complex reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains.

Crystal agglomeration analysis from microscopic images is challenging due to the inherent limitations of two-dimensional imaging. Overlapping crystals may appear connected even when located at different depth layers. Because optical microscopes have a shallow depth of field, crystals that are in-focus and out-of-focus in the same image typically reside on different depth layers and do not constitute true agglomeration. To address this, we first quantified camera focus with an instance camera focus prediction network to predict 2 class focus level that aligns better with visual observations than traditional image processing focus measures.

This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \\textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased.

However, its reliability requires robustness against strategic attacks such as guesswork or verbosity that may artificially inflate scores without improving actual correctness. In this work, we systematically investigate whether such tactics deceive answer matching models by prompting examinee models to: (1) generate verbose responses, (2) provide multiple answers when unconfident, and (3) embed conflicting answers with the correct answer near the start of their response. Our results show that these manipulations do not increase scores and often reduce them. Additionally, binary scoring (which requires a matcher to answer with a definitive \"correct\" or \"incorrect\") is more robust to attacks than continuous scoring (which requires a matcher to determine partial correctness).

Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested.

We introduce SpectraQuery, a hybrid natural-language query framework that integrates a relational Raman spectroscopy database with a vector-indexed scientific literature corpus using a Structured and Unstructured Query Language (SUQL)-inspired design. By combining semantic parsing with retrieval-augmented generation, SpectraQuery translates open-ended questions into coordinated SQL and literature retrieval operations, producing cited answers that unify numerical evidence with mechanistic explanation. Across SQL correctness, answer groundedness, retrieval effectiveness, and expert evaluation, SpectraQuery demonstrates strong performance: approximately 80 percent of generated SQL queries are fully correct, synthesized answers reach 93-97 percent groundedness with 10-15 retrieved passages, and battery scientists rate responses highly across accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity (4.1-4.6/5). These results show that hybrid retrieval architectures can meaningfully support scientific workflows by bridging data and discourse for high-volume experimental datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpectraQuery \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0e\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6587\u732e\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa SpectraQuery \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53d7 SUQL \u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u878d\u5408 SQL \u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u5411\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u534f\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u6587\u732e\u68c0\u7d22\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "SQL \u67e5\u8be2\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u7ea6 80%\uff1b\u7b54\u6848 groundedness \u8fbe 93\u201397%\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e 10\u201315 \u7bc7\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u732e\uff09\uff1b\u7535\u6c60\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u4f9d\u636e\u6027\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fbe 4.1\u20134.6/5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u8ff0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5207\u5b9e\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u79d1\u7814\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002"}}

Second, we introduce a dual-scale memory evaluation framework utilizing anchors and attractors, along with the AAUI(Anchor--Attractor Utilization Index) metric to measure memory activation rates.

The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u5b57\u4e73\u817a\u65ad\u5c42\u5408\u6210\uff08DBT\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u75c5\u7076\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\uff09\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u540e\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e14\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u53d7\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u8bca\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Bakic\u548cXCAT\u6570\u5b57\u4e73\u817a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u62dfDBT\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u63d2\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u75c5\u7076\uff083mm\u7403\u5f62\u4e0e6mm\u6bdb\u523a\u5f62\uff09\uff1b\u5f00\u5c556\u540d\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u96c6\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u89c6\u65f6\u957f\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u540e\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u53d7\u75c5\u7076\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u6bdb\u523a\u72b6\u75c5\u7076\u4e0a\u6ce8\u89c6\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u53d7\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u5728\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u5256\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u51b3\u7b56\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u4e88\u4ee5\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u8651\u3002"}}

Communication overhead is a central issue in SFL and can be mitigated with auxiliary networks. Yet, the fundamental client-side computation challenge remains, as back-propagation requires substantial memory and computation costs, severely limiting the scale of models that edge devices can support. To enable more resource-efficient client computation and reduce the client-server communication, we propose HERON-SFL, a novel hybrid optimization framework that integrates zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for local client training while retaining first-order (FO) optimization on the server. With the assistance of auxiliary networks, ZO updates enable clients to approximate local gradients using perturbed forward-only evaluations per step, eliminating memory-intensive activation caching and avoiding explicit gradient computation in the traditional training process. Leveraging the low effective rank assumption, we theoretically prove that HERON-SFL's convergence rate is independent of model dimensionality, addressing a key scalability concern common to ZO algorithms. Empirically, on ResNet training and language model (LM) fine-tuning tasks, HERON-SFL matches benchmark accuracy while reducing client peak memory by up to 64% and client-side compute cost by up to 33% per step, substantially expanding the range of models that can be trained or adapted on resource-limited devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "HERON-SFL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u91c7\u7528\u96f6\u9636\uff08ZO\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u7aef\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u9636\uff08FO\uff09\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5373\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Split Federated Learning\u4e2d\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u56e0\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHERON-SFL\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u524d\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u7aef\u4ecd\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u8f85\u52a9\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728ResNet\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u57fa\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a64%\uff0c\u5355\u6b65\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a33%\u3002", "conclusion": "HERON-SFL\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347SFL\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches remain fundamentally limited to text modality. Extending autonomous information-seeking agents to multimodal settings introduces critical challenges: the specialization-generalization trade-off that emerges when training models for multimodal tool-use at scale, and the severe scarcity of training data capturing complex, multi-step multimodal search trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose M$^3$Searcher, a modular multimodal information-seeking agent that explicitly decouples information acquisition from answer derivation.

Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5757\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08BWSSL\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5757\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u63a5\u8fd1\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e14\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u53d1\u5c55\u5448\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u66b4\u9732\u3001\u540e\u671f\u6a21\u5757\u9971\u548c\u7b49\u65b0\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4f9d\u8d56\u957f\u7a0b\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u800c\u5206\u5757\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08BWSSL\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9700\u5e94\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9BWSSL\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u89c6\u9891ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5757\uff0c\u6bcf\u5757\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b\u5e76\u4ece\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u3001\u5757\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001patch\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5757\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5212\u5206\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5757\u66f4\u5feb\u66b4\u9732\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5757\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\u5e76\u8fdb\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u8fd8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230token\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6c60\u5316\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5757\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5177\u72ec\u7279\u8868\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1b\u540e\u671f\u5757\u9971\u548c\u4e0e\u5757\u95f4\u63a5\u53e3\u5f62\u6210\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u72b6\u7f13\u5b58\u5386\u53f2\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u901f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u901f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5206\u5e03\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpeculative Rollout with Tree-Structured Cache\uff08SRT\uff09\uff1a\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2aprompt\u7ef4\u62a4\u6811\u72b6\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u5386\u53f2\u7eed\u5199\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GPU\u7a7a\u95f2\u671f\u4e3b\u52a8\u9884\u751f\u6210\uff08run-ahead\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8349\u7a3f\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728PPO\u3001GRPO\u3001DAPO\u7b49\u6807\u51c6RL\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ca\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u540e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5355token\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6eda\u52a8 rollout \u9636\u6bb5\u6700\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b02.08\u500d\u5b9e\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "SRT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u901a\u7528\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347RLHF\u7b49\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Code, model, and benchmark publicly released", "summary": "Automated news verification requires structured claim extraction, but existing approaches either lack schema compliance or generalize poorly across domains. This paper presents NewsScope, a cross-domain dataset, benchmark, and fine-tuned model for schema-grounded news claim extraction. The dataset contains 455 articles across politics, health, science/environment, and business, consisting of 395 in-domain articles and 60 out-of-source articles for generalization testing. LLaMA 3.1 8B was fine-tuned using LoRA on 315 training examples and evaluated on held-out in-domain (80 articles) and out-of-source (60 articles) test sets. Human evaluation on 400 claims shows NewsScope achieves 89.4% human-evaluated accuracy compared to GPT-4o-mini's 93.7% (p=0.07). NewsScope outperforms GPT-4o-mini on political claims (94.3% vs. 87.8%). A numeric grounding filter further improves accuracy to 91.6%, narrowing the gap to 2.1 percentage points.

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels. Experiments on the R-TOFU benchmark demonstrate that STaR achieves comprehensive and stable unlearning with minimal utility loss, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving reasoning in LRMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSTaR\u7684\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u654f\u611f\u8f68\u8ff9\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u590d\u6742\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u8f68\u8ff9\u6613\u5d4c\u5165\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4fee\u6539\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6e05\u9664\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u654f\u611f\u8f68\u8ff9\u8c03\u63a7\uff08STaR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u793a\u524d\u7f00\u6ce8\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b3\uff09\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u963b\u65ad\u6574\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b4\uff09\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u53ca\u6539\u5199\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u654f\u611f\u8bcd\u5143\u751f\u6210\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u591a\u89e3\u7801\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08MCS\uff09\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIA\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728R-TOFU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSTaR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8986\u76d6\u7b54\u6848\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "STaR\u4e3aLRMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks.

This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (>95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5316\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u8c03\u5ea6\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Kubernetes\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u6790\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8f6f\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8c03\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u96c6\u7fa4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u914d\u914d\u7f6e\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u3001\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Amazon Nova Pro/Premier\u3001Mistral Pixtral Large\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u81f3Kubernetes\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u96c6\u7fa4\u72b6\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eAWS Bedrock\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8f6f\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aLLM\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8595%\uff08Subset Accuracy\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u516d\u7c7b\u8c03\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8c03\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6Kubernetes\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u53ca\u5b9a\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u51b2\u7a81\u504f\u597d\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u8c03\u7528LLM\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5316\u8f6f\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u8c03\u5ea6\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7f16\u6392\uff1b\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u5f02\u6b65LLM\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts. To support community research, we publicly release our models and the training dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDASD-4B-Thinking\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bSOTA\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u90e8\u5206\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e8e\u6279\u5224\u6027\u53cd\u601d\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5efa\u6a21\u6559\u5e08\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5339\u914d\u5e08\u751f\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u7f13\u89e3\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u6570\u636e\uff08448K\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eSFT\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u4ece\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u672c\u8d28\u2014\u2014\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u7ee7\u627f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u6559\u5e08\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u5e08\u751f\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3001\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5efa\u6a21\u6559\u5e08\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e08\u751f\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u7f13\u89e3\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u6452\u5f03\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0fSFT\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "DASD-4B-Thinking\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578bSOTA\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u82e5\u5e72\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528448K\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff08\u6bd4\u591a\u6570\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff09\u5373\u83b7\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6559\u5e08\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5e08\u751f\u4ea4\u4e92\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff1bDASD-4B-Thinking\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f00\u6e90\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u793e\u533a\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Current methods mainly perform single-step or fixed-horizon rollouts, leaving their potential for complex task planning under-exploited. We propose Imagine-then-Plan (\\texttt{ITP}), a unified framework for agent learning via lookahead imagination, where an agent's policy model interacts with the learned world model, yielding multi-step ``imagined'' trajectories. Since the imagination horizon may vary by tasks and stages, we introduce a novel adaptive lookahead mechanism by trading off the ultimate goal and task progress. The resulting imagined trajectories provide rich signals about future consequences, such as achieved progress and potential conflicts, which are fused with current observations, formulating a partially \\textit{observable} and \\textit{imaginable} Markov decision process to guide policy learning.

Our approach follows a model-based paradigm, using Coloured Timed Petri Nets to represent the scheduling environment, and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to enable dynamic decision-making while restricting the agent to feasible actions at each decision point. To simulate realistic industrial conditions, dynamic job arrivals are modeled using a Gamma distribution, which captures complex temporal patterns such as bursts, clustering, and fluctuating workloads. Machine failures are modeled using a Weibull distribution to represent age-dependent degradation and wear-out dynamics. These stochastic models enable the framework to reflect real-world manufacturing scenarios better. In addition, we study two action-masking strategies: a non-gradient approach that overrides the probabilities of invalid actions, and a gradient-based approach that assigns negative gradients to invalid actions within the policy network. We conduct extensive experiments on dynamic JSSP benchmarks, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms traditional heuristic and rule-based approaches in terms of makespan minimization.

Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

A lightweight classifier predicts instance correctness, and averaging predicted probabilities yields a domain-level accuracy estimate. We evaluate on ten STEM reasoning benchmarks with exhaustive train/test compositions (k in {1,2,3,4}; all \"10 choose k\" combinations), across nine LLMs from six families (3B-20B).

In this work, we consider a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning approach for single-agent autonomous driving in lane-free traffic, where the associated Markov Decision Process we formulate is influenced from existing approaches tied to reinforcement learning frameworks. In addition, MCTS is equipped with a pre-trained neural network (NN) that guides the selection phase. This procedure incorporates the predictive capabilities of NNs for a more informed tree search process under computational constraints. In our experimental evaluation, we consider metrics that address both safety (through collision rates) and efficacy (through measured speed). Then, we examine: (a) the influence of isotropic state information for vehicles in a lane-free environment, resulting in nudging behaviour--vehicles' policy reacts due to the presence of faster tailing ones, (b) the acceleration of performance for the NN-guided variant of MCTS, and (c) the trade-off between computational resources and solution quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u8f66\u9053\u7ea6\u675f\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff08\u78b0\u649e\u7387\uff09\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff08\u8f66\u901f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u3001NN\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u8f66\u9053\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u867d\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u9053\u8def\u901a\u884c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\u51b3\u7b56\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53d7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff1bNN\u7528\u4e8eMCTS\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\uff08\u4f4e\u78b0\u649e\u7387\uff09\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff08\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u901f\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u53d1\u8f66\u8f86\u2018 nudging\u2019\u884c\u4e3a\uff1bNN\u5f15\u5bfc\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fMCTS\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u660e\u786e\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "NN\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684MCTS\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u8f66\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSAM-Aug\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Segment Anything Model\uff08SAM\uff09\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\uff085%\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u5e8f\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u4e91\u5408\u6210\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165RegionSmoothLoss\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u5e27\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347mIoU\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5728\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAM-Aug\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u65f6\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u4e91\u5408\u6210\u5f71\u50cf\uff1b2\uff09\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8c03\u7528SAM\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1RegionSmoothLoss\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5728SAM\u5212\u5206\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u5e8f\u5e27\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728PASTIS-R\u57fa\u51c65%\u6807\u6ce8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8bd5mIoU\u8fbe36.21%\uff0c\u8f83SOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53472.33\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9+6.89%\uff09\uff1b\u6700\u4f18\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\u8fbe40.28%\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534711.2%\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u5f3a\u6b63\u5219\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9065\u611f\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763/\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Recent advances in artificial intelligence enable data-driven modeling frameworks capable of supporting automated decision-making in construction quality control. This study leverages an industry-scale dataset consisting of approximately 70,000 compressive strength test records to evaluate and compare multiple predictive approaches, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, transformer-based neural networks, and embedding-based neural networks. The models incorporate key mixture design and placement variables such as water cement ratio, cementitious material content, slump, air content, temperature, and placement conditions. Results indicate that the embedding-based neural network consistently outperforms traditional machine learning and transformer-based models, achieving a mean 28-day prediction error of approximately 2.5%.

This is followed by a reinforcement learning phase, where we optimize translation quality using an ensemble of reward models, including MetricX-QE and AutoMQM, targeting translation quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TranslateGemma with human evaluation on the WMT25 test set across 10 language pairs and with automatic evaluation on the WMT24++ benchmark across 55 language pairs. Automatic metrics show consistent and substantial gains over the baseline Gemma 3 models across all sizes. Notably, smaller TranslateGemma models often achieve performance comparable to larger baseline models, offering improved efficiency.

This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term user's intents and dynamically adapt to evolving external environments. In this paper, we propose a novel interaction paradigm for proactive Task-oriented Agents capable of bridging the gap between relatively static user's needs and a dynamic environment. We formalize proactivity through two key capabilities, (i) Intent-Conditioned Monitoring: The agent autonomously formulates trigger conditions based on dialog history; (ii) Event-Triggered Follow-up: The agent actively engages the user upon detecting useful environmental updates. We introduce a high-quality data synthesis pipeline to construct complex, multi-turn dialog data in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, we attempt to address the lack of evaluation criteria of task-oriented interaction in a dynamic environment by proposing a new benchmark, namely ChronosBench.

Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faslow4fast-VLN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u6162\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVLN\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ed\u96c6\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5e94\uff08GSA-VLN\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5feb\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6267\u884c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff1b\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728GSA-VLN\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5feb\u6162\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86VLN\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic benchmarking framework for evaluating multilingual and multicultural capabilities through the social deduction game Spyfall. In our setup, models must engage in strategic dialogue to either identify a secret agent or avoid detection, utilizing culturally relevant locations or local foods. Our results show that our game-based rankings align closely with the Chatbot Arena. However, we find a significant performance gap in non-English contexts: models are generally less proficient when handling locally specific entities and often struggle with rule-following or strategic integrity in non-English languages. We demonstrate that this game-based approach provides a scalable, leakage-resistant, and culturally nuanced alternative to traditional NLP benchmarks.

Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries. Extensive evaluations on five multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFSM. In particular, EvoFSM reaches 58.0% accuracy on the DeepSearch benchmark. Additional results on interactive decision-making tasks further validate its generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEvoFSM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\uff08FSM\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5b8f\u89c2\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5fae\u89c2\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u6279\u8bc4\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u771f\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u867d\u6709\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6539\u5199\u4ee3\u7801/\u63d0\u793a\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEvoFSM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u6f14\u5316\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\uff08FSM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u5b8f\u89c2Flow\uff08\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u903b\u8f91\uff09\u548c\u5fae\u89c2Skill\uff08\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6279\u8bc4\u673a\u5236\u6307\u5bfc\u53d7\u9650\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884cFSM\u7cbe\u70bc\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u63d0\u70bc\u6210\u529f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0cDeepSearch\u57fa\u51c6\u8fbe58.0%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5c55\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\uff08\u4ee5FSM\u4e3a\u8f7d\u4f53\uff09\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The prevailing \"restoration-then-recognition\" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-VL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u69fd\u67e5\u8be2\uff08CMRM\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8f66\u724c\u5b57\u7b26\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\uff09\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u4e34\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5149\u7167\u7b49\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u201c\u5148\u6062\u590d\u540e\u8bc6\u522b\u201d\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8303\u5f0f\u56e0\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6062\u590d\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u7d2f\u79ef\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8f66\u724c\u5b57\u7b26\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u987a\u5e8f\uff09\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-VL\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08CMRM\uff09\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u69fd\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b57\u7b26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8c03\u5236\u5c06\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6062\u590d-\u8bc6\u522b\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u901a\u7528VLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u5f0f\u878d\u5165\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u5e8f\u5217\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Corresponding author: Yan Lin", "summary": "Detecting evasive answers in earnings calls is critical for financial transparency, yet progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmarks. We introduce EvasionBench, comprising 30,000 training samples and 1,000 human-annotated test samples (Cohen's Kappa 0.835) across three evasion levels. Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization.

Task2Quiz: A Paradigm for Studying Environment Understanding", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making and tool-use tasks, yet their ability to generalize across varying environments remains a under-examined concern. Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment. These findings identify proactive exploration and fine-grained state representation as primary bottlenecks, offering a robust foundation for developing more generalizable autonomous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTask-to-Quiz\uff08T2Q\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff1b\u5728T2QBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u867d\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5374\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7b49\u8f68\u8ff9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5185\u5728\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u89e3\u8026\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684Task-to-Quiz\uff08T2Q\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b30\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u30011967\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684T2QBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5b9a\u91cf\u8861\u91cf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u63a5\u5730\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u7c97\u7cd9\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff1bT2Q\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

We propose a Lightweight Pyramid Cross-Attention Network (LPCANet) that leverages RGB-D data for efficient and accurate defect identification. The architecture integrates MobileNetv2 as a backbone for RGB feature extraction with a lightweight pyramid module (LPM) for depth processing, coupled with a cross-attention mechanism (CAM) for multimodal fusion and a spatial feature extractor (SFE) for enhanced structural analysis. Comprehensive evaluations on three unsupervised RGB-D rail datasets (NEU-RSDDS-AUG, RSDD-TYPE1, RSDD-TYPE2) demonstrate that LPCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 9.90 million parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps inference speed. Compared to 18 existing methods, LPCANet shows significant improvements, including +1.48\\% in $S_\u03b1$, +0.86\\% in IOU, and +1.77\\% in MAE over the best-performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of CAM and SFE, while experiments on non-rail datasets (DAGM2007, MT, Kolektor-SDD2) validate its generalization capability.

Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u6563\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DiSOL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u5c40\u90e8\u8d21\u732e\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ec4\u88c5\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\uff08\u5982\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u4e0bPDE\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u5e38\u5f15\u53d1\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7a81\u53d8\uff09\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u5176\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiSOL\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5c40\u90e8\u8d21\u732e\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ec4\u88c5\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u7ecf\u5178\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u5173\u7684Poisson\u3001\u5bf9\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u3001\u7ebf\u5f39\u6027\u53ca\u65f6\u7a7a\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0cDiSOL\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08\u542b\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3b\u5bfc\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u7b97\u5b50\u8868\u793a\uff1bDiSOL\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Omni-R1\uff08\u542b\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5SFT+RL\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u53d8\u4f53Omni-R1-Zero\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u9700\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u533a\u57df\u805a\u7126\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u8bb0\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u6784\u5efaOmni-R1\uff08SFT+RL\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\uff09\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faOmni-R1-Zero\uff0c\u4ece\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u9010\u6b65\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u514d\u53bb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "Omni-R1\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff1bOmni-R1-Zero\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8aOmni-R1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0cOmni-R1\u53ca\u96f6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684Omni-R1-Zero\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Therefore, aiming to learn better generalization ability on both unseen categories and domains is a realistic goal for the SDG-DML task. To deliver the aspiration, existing SDG-DML methods employ the domain expansion-equalization strategy to expand the source data and generate out-of-distribution samples. However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions. Specifically, \\textbf{CenterPolar} contains two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$). In the first phase, $C^3E$ drives the source domain distribution by shifting the source data away from class centroids using centrifugal expansion to generalize to more unseen domains. In the second phase, to consolidate domain-invariant class information for the generalization ability to unseen categories, $C^4$ pulls all seen and unseen samples toward their class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation via centripetal constraint. Extensive experimental results on widely used CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our CenterPolar over existing state-of-the-art methods.

This ability can be applied to support intelligent decision-making across diverse fields, such as financial forecasting and preventive healthcare. However, directly prompting LLMs for probability estimation faces significant challenges: their outputs are often noisy, and the underlying predicting process is opaque. In this paper, we propose PRISM: Probability Reconstruction via Shapley Measures, a framework that brings transparency and precision to LLM-based probability estimation. PRISM decomposes an LLM's prediction by quantifying the marginal contribution of each input factor using Shapley values.

However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios. Along the way, we introduce Large-Scale-OR and Air-NRM, the first comprehensive benchmarks for large-scale optimization auto-formulation.

In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to \"unfold\" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2).

Counterfactual explanations offer actionable recourse, are inherently causal and local, and easy for educational stakeholders to understand who are often non-experts. We propose KTCF, a counterfactual explanation generation method for KT that accounts for knowledge concept relationships, and a post-processing scheme that converts a counterfactual explanation into a sequence of educational instructions. We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics. Additionally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our post-processing scheme, demonstrating that the resulting educational instructions help in reducing large study burden.

Functional Analysis and Transferability of Generalization Circuits in Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at factual retrieval, they often struggle with the \"curse of two-hop reasoning\" in compositional tasks. Recent research suggests that parameter-sharing transformers can bridge this gap by forming a \"Generalization Circuit\" during a prolonged \"grokking\" phase. A fundamental question arises: Is a grokked model superior to its non-grokked counterparts on downstream tasks? Furthermore, is the extensive computational cost of waiting for the grokking phase worthwhile? In this work, we conduct a mechanistic study to evaluate the Generalization Circuit's role in knowledge assimilation and transfer. We demonstrate that: (i) The inference paths established by non-grokked and grokked models for in-distribution compositional queries are identical. This suggests that the \"Generalization Circuit\" does not represent the sudden acquisition of a new reasoning paradigm. Instead, we argue that grokking is the process of integrating memorized atomic facts into an naturally established reasoning path. (ii) Achieving high accuracy on unseen cases after prolonged training and the formation of a certain reasoning path are not bound; they can occur independently under specific data regimes.

To facilitate this study, we introduce AndroidIntent, a benchmark designed to evaluate agents' ability in resolving vague instructions and providing proactive suggestions through reasoning over long-term user records.

However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm.

We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule. We highlight the computational efficiency of EBC and EBC-H by comparing their per-sample run time with that of existing algorithms. The asymptotic optimality of EBC is supported through simulations on the synthetic datasets.

A key challenge is learning representations that are robust to nuisance variation such as gender while remaining tone-aware for different lexical meanings. To address this, we propose SITA, a lightweight adaptation recipe that enforces Speaker-Invariance and Tone-Awareness for pretrained wav2vec-style encoders. SITA uses staged multi-objective training: (i) a cross-gender contrastive objective encourages lexical consistency across speakers, while a tone-repulsive loss prevents tone collapse by explicitly separating same-word different-tone realizations; and (ii) an auxiliary Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR objective with distillation stabilizes recognition-relevant structure. We evaluate primarily on Hmong, a highly tonal and severely under-resourced language where off-the-shelf multilingual encoders fail to represent tone effectively. On a curated Hmong word corpus, SITA improves cross-gender lexical retrieval accuracy, while maintaining usable ASR accuracy relative to an ASR-adapted XLS-R teacher.

Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance.

Chadwick"], "title": "Multi-Teacher Ensemble Distillation: A Mathematical Framework for Probability-Domain Knowledge Aggregation", "comment": "7 pages, 1 table", "summary": "Building on the probability-domain distillation framework of Sparse-KD, we develop an axiomatic, operator-theoretic framework for multi-teacher ensemble knowledge distillation. Rather than prescribing a specific aggregation formula, we define five core axioms governing valid knowledge aggregation operators, encompassing convexity, positivity, continuity, weight monotonicity, and temperature coherence. We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.\n  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes. The framework provides theoretical grounding for multi-teacher distillation from diverse frontier models while admitting multiple valid implementation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u7406\u5316\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u516c\u7406\u6765\u89c4\u8303\u77e5\u8bc6\u805a\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u7406\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u65cf\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u7b97\u5b50\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u964d\u4f4e\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u76d1\u7763\u504f\u5dee\u3001Jensen\u578b\u754c\u3001\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\u5316\u3001\u901a\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u6761\u6838\u5fc3\u516c\u7406\uff08\u51f8\u6027\u3001\u6b63\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u8bef\u5dee\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e94\u516c\u7406\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u65cf\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u4e0d\u552f\u4e00\uff1b\u83b7\u5f97\u7b97\u5b50\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff08\u5982\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u3001Jensen\u754c\u3001log-loss\u754c\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u8870\u51cf\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u590d\u73b0\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \\rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \\$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time.

We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms.

While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem.

The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u611f\u77e5\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u56de\u5f52\u635f\u5931\uff08NEIoU\uff09\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6NEIoU YOLOv9\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u75c5\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u6c34\u7a3b\u53f6\u7247\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347mAP\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8eAndroid\u7aef\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u519c\u4e1a\u75c5\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edfIoU\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u5728\u5f31\u91cd\u53e0\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f31\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u9ad8\u6548\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd4\uff08NEIoU\uff09\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u805a\u7126\u4e0e\u5bbd\u9ad8\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u91cd\u5851\u5b9a\u4f4d\u68af\u5ea6\uff1b\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7YOLOv9t\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u6c34\u7a3b\u53f6\u7247\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff085908\u5f20\u56fe\uff0c5\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u4f7f\u7528TensorFlow Lite Float16\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3Android\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4CIoU\uff0cmAP\u8fbe90.3%\uff0c\u63d0\u53474.3\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u4e25\u683c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1bAndroid\u7aef\u5e73\u5747\u5355\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u8017\u65f6156ms\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "NEIoU\u635f\u5931\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5f31\u6837\u672c\u56de\u5f52\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u6291\u5236\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u519c\u4e1a\u8fb9\u7f18\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

A key challenge lies in sample-wise imbalance within the forget set: different samples exhibit widely varying unlearning difficulty, leading to asynchronous forgetting where some knowledge remains insufficiently erased while others become over-forgotten. To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBalDRO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7min-sup\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u6837\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5373LLM unlearning\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u4e2d\u6837\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u5206\u77e5\u8bc6\u672a\u5145\u5206\u64e6\u9664\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u88ab\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\uff08\u5f02\u6b65\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBalDRO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06unlearning\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3amin-sup\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u5185\u5c42\u5bfb\u627e\u5f3a\u8c03\u96be\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6700\u574f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u5728\u6b64\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1aBalDRO-G\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eGroupDRO\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\uff09\u548cBalDRO-DV\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eDonsker-Varadhan\u5bf9\u5076\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728TOFU\u548cMUSE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBalDRO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "BalDRO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u5e73\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6837\u672c\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9057\u5fd8\u5f7b\u5e95\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u67b6\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u9662\u672c\u5730\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u7b97\u529b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u843d\u5730\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u539f\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8111MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff081104\u4f8b3D\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\u53ca\u8179\u90e8CT\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1194%\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u755998.7%\uff0cCPU\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a67%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u90e8\u7f72\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u5c06\u7814\u7a76\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This design has notable shortcomings: real-world relations are often contextual, nuanced, and sometimes uncertain, and compressing it into discrete relation labels abstracts away critical semantic detail. Nevertheless, symbolic-relation KGs remain widely used because they have been operationally effective and broadly compatible with pre-LLM downstream models and algorithms, in which KG knowledge could be retrieved or encoded into quantified features and embeddings at scale. The emergence of LLMs has reshaped how knowledge is created and consumed. LLMs support scalable synthesis of domain facts directly in concise natural language, and prompting-based inference favors context-rich free-form text over quantified representations. This position paper argues that these changes call for rethinking the representation of relations themselves rather than merely using LLMs to populate conventional schemas more efficiently. We therefore advocate moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and we propose hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u5e94\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\u8f6c\u5411\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u65f6\u4ee3\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u517c\u987e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9aa8\u67b6\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u6807\u7b7e\u8fc7\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u7ec6\u5fae\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u800cLLM\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u4f7f\u5f97\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u5411\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u7cfb\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u539f\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u7cfb\u63cf\u8ff0\u5728LLM\u65f6\u4ee3\u66f4\u5177\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u5c06LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u586b\u5145\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5730\u8f6c\u5411\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance.

A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPaGKD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u767d\u5149\u4e0e\u7a84\u5e26\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u955c\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u914d\u5bf9\u7684NBI-WLI\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation\uff08PaGKD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bGroup-level Prototype Distillation\uff08GKD-Pro\uff09\u548cGroup-level Dense Distillation\uff08GKD-Den\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u7ea7\u522b\u800c\u975e\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cAUC\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.3%\u30011.1%\u30012.8%\u548c3.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "PaGKD\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u53d8\u91cfHawkes\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014Hawkes Attention\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u5e8f\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MTPP\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u8c03\u5236\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u952e\u548c\u503c\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u6ce8\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5171\u4eab\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8870\u51cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u8d28\u4e14\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u591a\u53d8\u91cfHawkes\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Hawkes Attention\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6bcf\u7c7b\u578b\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u6765\u8c03\u5236Query\u3001Key\u3001Value\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528MTPP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u8be5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8fd8\u53ef\u4fbf\u6377\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "Hawkes Attention\u6709\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6fc0\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MTPP\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, many real-world applications, such as navigating text-based maps or interpreting structured tables, rely heavily on precise sub-token understanding. In this regard, we introduce SubTokenTest, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses sub-token understanding through practical, utility-driven tasks. Our benchmark includes ten tasks across four domains and isolates tokenization-related failures by decoupling performance from complex reasoning.

This mapping is naturally formulated as an Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) problem, but supervised solutions are constrained by the scarcity and cost of large-scale, taxonomy-aligned annotations--especially in non-English settings where job-ad language diverges substantially from formal skill definitions. We propose a zero-shot skill extraction framework that eliminates the need for manually labeled job-ad training data. The framework uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize training instances from ESCO definitions, and introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts. On top of the synthetic corpus, we train a contrastive bi-encoder that aligns job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space; the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements. An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision. Experiments show that (i) hierarchy-conditioned generation improves both fluency and discriminability relative to unconstrained pairing, and (ii) the resulting multi-label model transfers effectively to real-world Chinese job advertisements, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval performance (F1@5 = 0.72) and outperforming TF--IDF and standard BERT baselines.

A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., \"bad,\" \"neutral,\" \"good\"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5R4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08rMSE\uff09\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8bc4\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u6570\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u5b8c\u5907\u89e3\u96c6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u5f0fRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8bc4\u5206\u5f62\u5f0f\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRanked Return Regression for RL\uff08R4\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6392\u5e8f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08rMSE\uff09\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9-\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8bc4\u5206\u89c6\u4e3a\u5e8f\u6570\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8f6f\u6392\u5e8f\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "R4\u5728OpenAI Gym\u548cDeepMind Control Suite\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u5f0fRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u53cd\u9988\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "R4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u5b8c\u5907\u89e3\u96c6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u53cd\u9988\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs.

Unlike prior work on stereotypical or representational bias, this paper studies identity-dependent degradation of core response quality. We show empirically that such degradation arises from biased generation behavior, despite factual knowledge being robustly encoded across identities. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework for identity-robust generation that selectively neutralizes non-critical identity information while preserving semantically essential attributes, thus maintaining output content integrity. Experiments across four benchmarks and 18 sociodemographic identities demonstrate an average 77% reduction in identity-dependent bias compared to vanilla prompting and a 45% reduction relative to prompt-based defenses.

However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features.

While learning-based solvers offer a promising alternative to costly numerical simulations, existing methods struggle to capture the heterogeneous dynamics of FSI within a unified framework. This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions. This enables specialized message-passing mechanisms tailored to each physical domain. To stabilize explicit time stepping, we introduce a novel physics-conditioned gating mechanism that serves as a learnable, adaptive relaxation factor. Furthermore, an Inter-domain Gradient-Balancing Loss dynamically balances the optimization objectives across domains based on predictive uncertainty.

Full fine-tuning is often computationally and energy intensive, which can be prohibitive for smaller institutions and non-profit organizations in the Web4Good ecosystem. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $\u0394W = BA^\\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $\u0394W = B\u03a3A^\\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold). A geometric reparameterization implements this constraint while remaining compatible with standard optimizers such as Adam and existing fine-tuning pipelines. We also propose a benchmark for hierarchical concept retrieval over the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), widely used to organize social science resources in digital repositories. Experiments with a multilingual sentence encoder show that OrthoGeoLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and several strong PEFT variants on ranking metrics under the same low-rank budget, offering a more compute- and parameter-efficient path to adapt foundation models in resource-constrained settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOrthoGeoLoRA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Stiefel\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f4e\u79e9\u56e0\u5b50\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u51c6LoRA\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u5982\u89c4\u8303\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u79e9\u574d\u7f29\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u8d44\u6e90\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6LoRA\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6LoRA\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u5982\u89c4\u8303\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u79e9\u574d\u7f29\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bf9Web4Good\u751f\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u673a\u6784\u548c\u975e\u8425\u5229\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOrthoGeoLoRA\uff1a\u5c06LoRA\u66f4\u65b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u7531\u0394W = BA\u22a4 \u6539\u4e3a \u0394W = B\u03a3A\u22a4\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236B\u548cA\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\uff08Stiefel\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u517c\u5bb9Adam\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u6d32\u8bed\u8a00\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u8bcd\u8868\uff08ELSST\uff09\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6982\u5ff5\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOrthoGeoLoRA\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4f4e\u79e9\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6LoRA\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u5f3aPEFT\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "OrthoGeoLoRA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u914d\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism.

To address this, we propose Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a simple yet effective framework that utilizes all self-generated samples. Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs.

However, traditional SFT often ignores the one-to-many nature of language by forcing alignment with a single reference answer, leading to the model overfitting to non-core expressions. Although our empirical analysis suggests that introducing multiple reference answers can mitigate this issue, the prohibitive data and computational costs necessitate a strategic shift: prioritizing the mitigation of single-reference overfitting over the costly pursuit of answer diversity. To achieve this, we reveal the intrinsic connection between token probability and semantic importance: high-probability tokens carry the core logical framework, while low-probability tokens are mostly replaceable expressions.

Establishing reliable correspondences requires descriptors that provide both high discriminative power and computational efficiency. To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size. Furthermore, our high-performance configuration outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods, including high-capacity DINOv2-based frameworks, while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices.

Preprint", "summary": "Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.\n  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.\n  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards.

To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data.\n  First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics.\n  Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation.\n  Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability.\n  Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL).

DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations.

When statistical heterogeneity across clients is severe, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) can improve performance by grouping similar clients and training cluster-wise models.

We propose Data Collaboration-based Clustered Federated Learning (DC-CFL), a single-round framework that completes both client clustering and cluster-wise learning, using only the information shared in DC analysis. DC-CFL quantifies inter-client similarity via total variation distance between label distributions, estimates clusters using hierarchical clustering, and performs cluster-wise learning via DC analysis. Experiments on multiple open datasets under representative non-IID conditions show that DC-CFL achieves accuracy comparable to multi-round baselines while requiring only one communication round.

In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats.

However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

We then propose a Cross-View Graph Synergy Network to represent student comments. This network comprises two components: (i) a Syntactic Branch that extracts explicit grammatical dependencies from parse trees, and (ii) a Semantic Branch that models latent conceptual relations derived from BERT-based similarity graphs. BiAffine fusion module aligns syntactic and semantic units, while a differential regularizer disentangles embeddings to encourage complementary representations. Finally, a cross-attention mechanism bridges the dimension-anchored evidence with the multi-view comment representations.

In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed. This finding suggests that a more elegant, parameter-efficient approach is attainable. Building on this insight, we propose LoRA-DETR, a flexible and lightweight framework that seamlessly integrates diverse assignment strategies into any DETR-style detector. Our method augments the primary network with multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each instantiating a different one-to-many assignment rule. These branches act as auxiliary modules that inject rich, varied supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference, thus incurring no additional computational cost. This design promotes robust joint optimization while maintaining the architectural simplicity of the original detector. Extensive experiments on different baselines validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our work presents a new paradigm for enhancing detectors, demonstrating that diverse ``one-to-many'' supervision can be integrated to achieve state-of-the-art results without compromising model elegance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLoRA-DETR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5206\u652f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u201c\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u201d\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347DETR\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "DETR\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u56e0\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u76d1\u7763\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u76d1\u7763\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6e90\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u800c\u975e\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u91cf\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faLoRA-DETR\uff1a\u5728\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u6dfb\u52a0\u591a\u4e2aLoRA\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u5206\u652f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5206\u914d\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6ce8\u5165\u591a\u6837\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u79fb\u9664\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aDETR\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose a specific architectural variant that triggers hindsight learning when the agent fails to reach its primary goal, re-labeling visited states as virtual goals to densify the learning signal. The proposed model was evaluated on two benchmarks: the deterministic \\texttt{Maze 6} and the stochastic \\texttt{FrozenLake}.

However, LLMs often produce inconsistent toxicity judgements for subtle expressions, particularly those involving implicit hate speech, revealing underlying biases that are difficult to correct through standard training. This raises a key question that existing approaches often overlook: when should corrective mechanisms be invoked to ensure fair and reliable assessments? To address this, we propose FairToT, an inference-time framework that enhances LLM fairness through prompt-guided toxicity assessment. FairToT identifies cases where demographic-related variation is likely to occur and determines when additional assessment should be applied. In addition, we introduce two interpretable fairness indicators that detect such cases and improve inference consistency without modifying model parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that FairToT reduces group-level disparities while maintaining stable and reliable toxicity predictions, demonstrating that inference-time refinement offers an effective and practical approach for fairness improvement in LLM-based toxicity assessment systems.

One approach for precise localization is visual place recognition (VPR), which estimates the place of an image based on previously seen places. State-of-the-art VPR models require high amounts of memory, making them unwieldy for mobile deployment, while more compact models lack robustness and generalization capabilities. This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location. Our compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities poses a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u4e0e\u65b0\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff08VPR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7c7b\u8111\u786c\u4ef6\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u5ba4\u5185VPR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eGPS\u62d2\u6b62\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VPR\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u9ad8\u3001\u96be\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u7aef\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u8f7b\u91cf\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u517c\u5bb9\u7c7b\u8111\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u91c7\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u5efa16\u573a\u666f\u5ba4\u5185VPR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u533a\u5206\u5730\u70b9\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfcVAE\u4e3a\u5ba4\u5185VPR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

It encompasses a diverse range of literary genres across six tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT), Speech Emotion Captioning (SEC), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Speech Understanding (SU), and Speech Reasoning (SR). Through the evaluation of ten MLLMs, our experimental results demonstrate that current models still face substantial challenges when processed on the MCGA test set. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation metric for SEC and a metric to measure the consistency between the speech and text capabilities of MLLMs. We release MCGA and our code to the public to facilitate the development of MLLMs with more robust multidimensional audio capabilities in CCS.

Improvements in solving this problem can greatly benefit the clinical value of optoacoustic imaging. Existing variational inversion methods require an accurate and differentiable model of this light transport. As neural surrogate models allow fast and differentiable simulations of complex physical processes, they are considered promising candidates to be used in solving such inverse problems. However, there are in general no guarantees that the derivatives of these surrogate models accurately match those of the underlying physical operator. As accurate derivatives are central to solving inverse problems, errors in the model derivative can considerably hinder high fidelity reconstructions. To overcome this limitation, we present a surrogate model for light transport in tissue that uses Sobolev training to improve the accuracy of the model derivatives.

Preprint", "summary": "Recent studies in medical question answering (Medical QA) have actively explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve factual accuracy. However, most existing approaches still rely on traversing the entire KG or performing large-scale retrieval, which introduces substantial noise and leads to unstable multi-hop reasoning. We argue that the core challenge lies not in expanding access to knowledge, but in identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence for each query. ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that addresses this challenge by constructing a query-aligned subgraph and performing stepwise reasoning constrained to this localized region under multiple evidence aware modes. By focusing inference on only the most relevant portion of the KG, ReGraM departs from the assumption that all relations are equally useful an assumption that rarely holds in domain-specific medical settings. Experiments on seven medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that ReGraM consistently outperforms a strong baseline (KGARevion), achieving an 8.04% absolute accuracy gain on MCQ, a 4.50% gain on SAQ, and a 42.9% reduction in hallucination rate. Ablation and qualitative analyses further show that aligning region construction with hop-wise reasoning is the primary driver of these improvements. Overall, our results highlight region-first KG reasoning as an effective paradigm for improving factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReGraM is a region-first knowledge graph reasoning framework that constructs query-aligned subgraphs and performs stepwise reasoning within localized regions to improve factual accuracy in medical question answering, outperforming strong baselines with significant gains in accuracy and reduced hallucination.", "motivation": "Existing Medical QA methods using LLMs and KGs suffer from noise and unstable multi-hop reasoning due to full-KG traversal or large-scale retrieval; the core challenge is identifying and reasoning over the appropriate subset of evidence per query.", "method": "ReGraM constructs a query-aligned subgraph (region) and performs stepwise, evidence-aware reasoning constrained to this localized region\u2014departing from the assumption that all KG relations are equally useful.", "result": "On seven medical QA benchmarks, ReGraM achieves +8.04% absolute accuracy on MCQ, +4.50% on SAQ, and 42.9% lower hallucination rate vs. KGARevion; ablation shows hop-wise aligned region construction drives improvements.", "conclusion": "Region-first KG reasoning is an effective paradigm for enhancing factual accuracy and consistency in medical QA."}}

Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges.

Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods.

Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Searth Transformer\u548cYanTian\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5982\u7403\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eac\u5411\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff09\u4e0eRelay Autoregressive\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5ef6\u957f\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u89c6\u5730\u7403\u7403\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7eac\u5411\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShifted Earth Transformer\uff08\u878d\u5408\u7403\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff09\u4e0eRelay Autoregressive\uff08RAR\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u7403\u4e2d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578bYanTian\u3002", "result": "YanTian\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aECMWF\u7684HRES\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u57281\u00b0\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5fae\u8c03\u76841/200\uff1bZ500\u6709\u6548\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u8fbe10.3\u5929\uff08\u4f18\u4e8eHRES\u76849\u5929\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u73af\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u5411ICT\u9886\u57df\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u578b\uff08DICModel\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u9886\u57df\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "ICT\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd8\u5927\u91cf\u9690\u85cf\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528Mermaid+LLM\u5408\u6210\u7ea67K\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7531ICT\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7ea62K\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0eLLM\u534f\u540c\u6784\u5efa\u7ea61.5K\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "7B\u53c2\u6570\u7684DICModel\u5728BLEU\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8f8332B SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u534720.8%\uff0c\u8f837B SOTA\u63d0\u534756.8%\uff1b\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u9898\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc7Qwen2.5-VL 32B\u7ea61%\u3002", "conclusion": "DICModel\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4eceICT\u9886\u57df\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u903b\u8f91\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce FairGU, a fairness-aware graph unlearning framework designed to preserve both utility and fairness during the unlearning process. FairGU integrates a dedicated fairness-aware module with effective data protection strategies, ensuring that sensitive attributes are neither inadvertently amplified nor structurally exposed when nodes are removed. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FairGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph unlearning methods and fairness-enhanced graph learning baselines in terms of both accuracy and fairness metrics. Our findings highlight a previously overlooked risk in current unlearning practices and establish FairGU as a robust and equitable solution for the next generation of socially sustainable networked systems.

Furthermore, we propose Relation-Aware Retrieval (RAR), a novel in-context example selection method based on contrastive learning, that is specifically designed to capture both sentence-level and relation-level semantics. Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model. These findings highlight the importance of high-quality demonstration retrieval and underscore the potential of advanced retrieval and prompting techniques to bridge resource gaps in clinical natural language processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u82f1-\u571f\u53cc\u8bed\u4e34\u5e8a\u5173\u7cfb\u62bd\u53d6\uff08RE\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5305\u62ecICL\u4e0eCoT\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\uff08RAR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u82f1/\u571f\u53cc\u8bedRE\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u4ee5\u82f1\u8bed\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u82f1-\u571f\u5e73\u884c\u4e34\u5e8aRE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6e90\u81eai2b2/VA 2010\uff09\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08ICL\u3001CoT\uff09\uff1b\u63d0\u51faRelation-Aware Retrieval\uff08RAR\uff09\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u53e5\u7ea7\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5LLM\u5168\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5982PURE\uff09\uff1b\u82f1\u8bed\u6027\u80fd\u666e\u904d\u9ad8\u4e8e\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed\uff1bRAR\u5728ICL\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff08Gemini 1.5 Flash\u8fbe\u82f1\u8bed0.906\u3001\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8bed0.888\u5faeF1\uff09\uff1bRAR+DeepSeek-V3\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u8fbe\u82f1\u8bed0.918 F1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u606f\u62bd\u53d6\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Multi-contrast MRI reconstruction has emerged as a promising direction by leveraging complementary information from fully-sampled reference scans. However, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) superficial reference fusion strategies, such as simple concatenation, (2) insufficient utilization of the complementary information provided by the reference contrast, and (3) fixed under-sampling patterns. We propose an efficient and interpretable frequency error-guided reconstruction framework to tackle these issues. We first employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), which is then incorporated into a unified framework for jointly optimizing both the under-sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. The proposed reconstruction model employs a model-driven deep unfolding framework that jointly exploits frequency- and image-domain information. In addition, a spatial alignment module and a reference feature decomposition strategy are incorporated to improve reconstruction quality and bridge model-based optimization with data-driven learning for improved physical interpretability. Comprehensive validation across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \\simmerge{}, \\emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \\simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \\simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly.

We investigate the Imperfective Paradox, a logical phenomenon where the past progressive aspect entails event realization for activities (e.g., running $\\to$ ran) but not for accomplishments (e.g., building $\\nrightarrow$ built). We introduce ImperfectiveNLI, a diagnostic dataset designed to probe this distinction across diverse semantic classes. Evaluating state-of-the-art open-weight models, we uncover a pervasive Teleological Bias: models systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, often overriding explicit textual negation.

Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations.

Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling.

We investigate how abilities are distributed within LLM parameters by analyzing module activations under domain- and language-specific inputs for closely related models. Across layers and modules, we find that ability-related activations are highly concentrated in a small set of channels (typically <5\\%), and these channels are largely disentangled with good sufficiency and stability. Building on these observations, we propose ACT (Activation-Guided Channel-wise Ability Transfer), which localizes ability-relevant channels via activation differences and selectively transfers only the corresponding parameters, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for compatibility.

In particular, DeepONets offer a natural formulation for PDE solving, since the solution of a partial differential equation can be interpreted as an operator mapping an initial condition to its corresponding solution field. In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive. Since each step of a cyclic adsorption process starts from the final state of the preceding step, effective surrogate modeling requires generalization across a wide range of initial conditions. The governing equations exhibit steep traveling fronts, providing a demanding benchmark for operator learning. To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators. The trained models are then tested on initial conditions outside the parameter ranges used during training, as well as on completely unseen functional forms. The results demonstrate accurate predictions both within and beyond the training distribution, highlighting DeepONets as potential efficient surrogates for accelerating cyclic adsorption simulations and optimization workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86DeepONets\u5728\u5438\u9644\u6280\u672f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u5438\u9644\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982TVSA\uff09\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u6b21\u6c42\u89e3\u77ac\u6001\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDE\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5faa\u73af\u5438\u9644\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982TVSA\uff09\u9700\u53cd\u590d\u6c42\u89e3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u77ac\u6001PDE\uff0c\u4e14\u6bcf\u6b65\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u524d\u4e00\u6b65\u7ec8\u6001\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u5e7f\u6cdb\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5f02\u8d28\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3DeepONets\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u5230\u89e3\u573a\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u56f4\u5916\u53ca\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "DeepONets\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u53ca\u4e4b\u5916\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5177\u6709\u9661\u5ced\u884c\u8fdb\u6ce2\u524d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027PDE\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepONets\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5faa\u73af\u5438\u9644\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002"}}

Recently, some works have incorporated iterative knowledge accumulation processes into RAG models to progressively accumulate and refine query-related knowledge, thereby constructing more comprehensive knowledge representations. However, these iterative processes often lack a coherent organizational structure, which limits the construction of more comprehensive and cohesive knowledge representations. To address this, we propose PAGER, a page-driven autonomous knowledge representation framework for RAG. PAGER first prompts an LLM to construct a structured cognitive outline for a given question, which consists of multiple slots representing a distinct knowledge aspect. Then, PAGER iteratively retrieves and refines relevant documents to populate each slot, ultimately constructing a coherent page that serves as contextual input for guiding answer generation. Experiments on multiple knowledge-intensive benchmarks and backbone models show that PAGER consistently outperforms all RAG baselines. Further analyses demonstrate that PAGER constructs higher-quality and information-dense knowledge representations, better mitigates knowledge conflicts, and enables LLMs to leverage external knowledge more effectively.

For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5SCAP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u5176\u9891\u8c31\uff0c\u4ee5\u9891\u8c31\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8861\u91cf\u901a\u9053\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u901a\u9053\u529f\u80fd\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u9ad8\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u901a\u9053\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u5f0f\u5224\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u6784\u9020\u590d\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e3a\u5b9e\u90e8\uff0c\u5355\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u51fa\u4e3a\u865a\u90e8\uff09\uff0c\u7ecf\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u81f3\u9891\u57df\u540e\uff0c\u7528\u4f4e\u5bb9\u91cf\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u9891\u8c31\uff1b\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u878d\u5408L1\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9608\u503c\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u7684VGG16\u4e0a\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c0.6\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b090.11% FLOPs\u548c96.30%\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u524a\u51cf\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540eTop-1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1.67%\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf93.44%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u590d\u6570\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u662f\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4ee3\u7406\uff0cSCAP\u80fd\u5728\u6fc0\u8fdb\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The ability to parallelize the processing of sequences with respect to the sequence length during training is one of the main factors behind the uprising of the Transformer architecture. However, Transformers lack efficiency at sequence generation, as they need to reprocess all past timesteps at every generation step. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) emerged as a more efficient alternative. These new kinds of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) keep the efficient update of the RNNs while gaining parallelization by getting rid of nonlinear dynamics (or recurrence). SSMs can reach state-of-the art performance through the efficient training of potentially very large networks, but still suffer from limited representation capabilities. In particular, SSMs cannot exhibit persistent memory, or the capacity of retaining information for an infinite duration, because of their monostability. In this paper, we introduce a new family of RNNs, the memory recurrent units (MRUs), that combine the persistent memory capabilities of nonlinear RNNs with the parallelizable computations of SSMs. These units leverage multistability as a source of persistent memory, while getting rid of transient dynamics for efficient computations. We then derive a specific implementation as proof-of-concept: the bistable memory recurrent unit (BMRU). This new RNN is compatible with the parallel scan algorithm. We show that BMRU achieves good results in tasks with long-term dependencies, and can be combined with state-space models to create hybrid networks that are parallelizable and have transient dynamics as well as persistent memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u2014\u2014\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff08MRU\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff08BMRU\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u626b\u63cf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4e0eSSM\u6784\u5efa\u517c\u5177\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u3001\u77ac\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSMs\uff09\u867d\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u5e76\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u5355\u7a33\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u975e\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u867d\u5177\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5374\u96be\u4ee5\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e2\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u957f\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0RNN\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff08MRU\uff09\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6d88\u9664\u77ac\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6784\u9020\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u2014\u2014\u53cc\u7a33\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff08BMRU\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u517c\u5bb9\u5e76\u884c\u626b\u63cf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u4e0eSSM\u7ed3\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "BMRU\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6df7\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u517c\u5177\u5e76\u884c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u3001\u77ac\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6301\u4e45\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MRU/BMRU\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e86RNN\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0eSSM\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

This rapid growth in size has constrained progress in understanding and mitigating their biases. Since re-training LMs is prohibitively expensive, most debiasing work has focused on post-hoc or masking-based strategies, which often fail to address the underlying causes of bias. In this work, we seek to democratise pre-model debiasing research by using low-cost proxy models. Specifically, we investigate BabyLMs, compact BERT-like models trained on small and mutable corpora that can approximate bias acquisition and learning dynamics of larger models. We show that BabyLMs display closely aligned patterns of intrinsic bias formation and performance development compared to standard BERT models, despite their drastically reduced size. Furthermore, correlations between BabyLMs and BERT hold across multiple intra-model and post-model debiasing methods. Leveraging these similarities, we conduct pre-model debiasing experiments with BabyLMs, replicating prior findings and presenting new insights regarding the influence of gender imbalance and toxicity on bias formation. Our results demonstrate that BabyLMs can serve as an effective sandbox for large-scale LMs, reducing pre-training costs from over 500 GPU-hours to under 30 GPU-hours.

This is the authors' final accepted manuscript", "summary": "With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods.

Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

Dedicated cloud GPU instances offer improved privacy but with limited guarantees and ongoing costs, while professional on-premise hardware (A100, H100) remains prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic evaluation of NVIDIA's Blackwell consumer GPUs (RTX 5060 Ti, 5070 Ti, 5090) for production LLM inference, benchmarking four open-weight models (Qwen3-8B, Gemma3-12B, Gemma3-27B, GPT-OSS-20B) across 79 configurations spanning quantization formats (BF16, W4A16, NVFP4, MXFP4), context lengths (8k-64k), and three workloads: RAG, multi-LoRA agentic serving, and high-concurrency APIs. The RTX 5090 delivers 3.5-4.6x higher throughput than the 5060 Ti with 21x lower latency for RAG, but budget GPUs achieve the highest throughput-per-dollar for API workloads with sub-second latency. NVFP4 quantization provides 1.6x throughput over BF16 with 41% energy reduction and only 2-4% quality loss.

However, smaller LMs often struggle with this translation task, frequently producing incorrect symbolic outputs due to formatting and translation errors. Existing approaches typically rely on self-iteration to correct these errors, but such methods depend heavily on the capabilities of the underlying model. To address this, we first categorize common errors and fine-tune smaller LMs using data synthesized by large language models. The evaluation is performed using the defined error categories. We introduce incremental inference, which divides inference into two stages, predicate generation and FOL translation, providing greater control over model behavior and enhancing generation quality as measured by predicate metrics. This decomposition framework also enables the use of a verification module that targets predicate-arity errors to further improve performance. Our study evaluates three families of models across four logical-reasoning datasets. The comprehensive fine-tuning, incremental inference, and verification modules reduce error rates, increase predicate coverage, and improve reasoning performance for smaller LMs, moving us closer to developing reliable and accessible symbolic-reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\uff08FOL\uff09\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u8c13\u8bcd\u751f\u6210+ FOL\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff09\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8c13\u8bcd\u5143\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u65f6\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5148\u751f\u6210\u8c13\u8bcd\uff0c\u518d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3aFOL\uff09\uff1b4\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u8c13\u8bcd\u5143\u6570\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8c13\u8bcd\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e09\u7c7b\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u53ca\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR.

Furthermore, we propose a contemporaneous causal identification algorithm, fully based on GC, using the proposed score-based $GP_{SIC}$ method, and compare its performance to a state of the art contemporaneous time series causal discovery algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684Granger\u56e0\u679c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u56de\u5f52\uff08KPCR\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e73\u6ed1\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u5219\uff08GP_SIC\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u540c\u671f\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684Granger\u56e0\u679c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u540c\u671f\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u4e24\u7c7b\u5148\u8fdb\u6838Granger\u56e0\u679c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u4e8e\u6838\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u56de\u5f52\uff08KPCR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5e73\u6ed1\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u5219\uff08SIC\uff09\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u4f3c\u7136\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff08GP_SIC\uff09\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8eGranger\u56e0\u679c\u7684\u540c\u671f\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528GP_SIC\u6253\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0KPCR\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1bGP_SIC\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u540c\u671f\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u540c\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Kernel\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7KPCR\u5b9e\u73b0\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GP_SIC\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u540c\u671fGC\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, evaluating these heterogeneous systems remains challenging, as existing protocols often struggle to provide comparable scores across architectures or rely on uncalibrated judgments. In this paper, we introduce SlidesGen-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate slide generation through a lens of three core principles: universality, quantification, and reliability. First, to establish a unified evaluation framework, we ground our analysis in the visual domain, treating terminal outputs as renderings to remain agnostic to the underlying generation method. Second, we propose a computational approach that quantitatively assesses slides across three distinct dimensions - Content, Aesthetics, and Editability - offering reproducible metrics where prior works relied on subjective or reference-dependent proxies. Finally, to ensure high correlation with human preference, we construct the Slides-Align1.5k dataset, a human preference aligned dataset covering slides from nine mainstream generation systems across seven scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that SlidesGen-Bench achieves a higher degree of alignment with human judgment than existing evaluation pipelines.

Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens.

MVSS follows a structure-first paradigm: it first constructs a conceptual tree of the research domain, then generates comparison tables constrained by the tree, and finally uses both as structural constraints for text generation. This enables complementary multi-view representations across structure, comparison, and narrative. We introduce an evaluation framework assessing structural quality, comparative completeness, and citation fidelity. Experiments on 76 computer science topics show MVSS outperforms existing methods in organization and evidence grounding, achieving performance comparable to expert surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMVSS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5148\u8303\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f15\u7528\u652f\u6491\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u6811\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u548c\u7efc\u8ff0\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u7efc\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u7efc\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u9898\u95f4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u64b0\u5199\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7efc\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6MVSS\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5148\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6811\uff0c\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6811\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u683c\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8054\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u6307\u5bfc\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u572876\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMVSS\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6027\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6491\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002", "conclusion": "MVSS\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3001\u53d9\u8ff0\uff09\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7efc\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u5f15\u7528\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7535\u8def\u673a\u5236\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807CUD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u6613\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6613/\u96be\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6e90\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u66f4\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6709\u5173\uff1b\u9700\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u5c42\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7535\u8def\uff08structured interaction pathways\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCircuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD)\u8fd9\u4e00\u9884\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u8fde\u7eed\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u6613/\u96be\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u3002", "result": "CUD\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u533a\u5206\u56fa\u6709\u6613/\u96be\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u8de8\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u6613\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u5e94\u77ed\u800c\u6d45\u3001\u504f\u65e9\u4e2d\u671f\u7684\u7535\u8def\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u96be\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u5219\u4f9d\u8d56\u957f\u800c\u6df1\u3001\u9760\u8fd1\u665a\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "CUD\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u539f\u7406\u6027\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively \"dressing\" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

Many existing approaches address this difficulty by heavily constraining the protocol search space, which limits the diversity of protocols that can be explored, preventing the discovery of higher-performing solutions. We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-loop methods: Prompt-to-Optimizer (P2O), which uses an LLM to propose the code for small neural-network-based protocols, which are then trained by an inner loop, and Prompt-to-Protocol (P2P), which simply writes an explicit function for the current and its scalar parameters. Across our case studies, LLM-guided P2O outperforms neural networks designed by Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and random search. In a realistic fast charging scenario, both P2O and P2P yield around a 4.2 percent improvement in state of health (capacity retention based health metric under fast charging cycling) over a state-of-the-art multi-step constant current (CC) baseline, with P2P achieving this under matched evaluation budgets (same number of protocol evaluations).

Despite various post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms being proposed, they mostly focus on integer quantization, while their applicability and behavior under MXFP formats remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact.

We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

We introduce Dialogue Telemetry (DT), a measurement framework that produces two model-agnostic signals after each question-answer exchange: (i) a Progress Estimator (PE) quantifying residual information potential per category (with a bits-based variant), and (ii) a Stalling Index (SI) detecting an observable failure signature characterized by repeated category probing with semantically similar, low-marginal-gain responses. SI flags this pattern without requiring causal diagnosis, supporting monitoring in settings where attributing degradation to specific causes may be impractical. We validate DT in controlled search-and-rescue (SAR)-inspired interviews using large language model (LLM)-based simulations, distinguishing efficient from stalled dialogue traces and illustrating downstream utility by integrating DT signals into a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. Across these settings, DT provides interpretable turn-level instrumentation that improves policy performance when stalling carries operational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9065\u6d4b\uff08DT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u6548\u63d0\u95ee\u3002DT\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1a\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08PE\uff09\u548c\u505c\u6ede\u6307\u6570\uff08SI\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u641c\u6551\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff08\u56de\u5408\u7ea7\uff09\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u6216\u53ca\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u6548\u63d0\u95ee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9065\u6d4b\uff08DT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08PE\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6bd4\u7279\u4e3a\u5355\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u7c7b\u522b\u5269\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u505c\u6ede\u6307\u6570\uff08SI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u589e\u76ca\u4f4e\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u63d0\u95ee\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u505c\u6ede\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u56e0\u679c\u5f52\u56e0\u3002\u5728LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u641c\u6551\u6a21\u62df\u548cRL\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "DT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0e\u505c\u6ede\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u96c6\u6210DT\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684RL\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1bDT\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u56de\u5408\u7ea7\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8bca\u65ad\u5931\u6548\u6839\u6e90\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes.

By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace.

This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR).

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ConGLUDe\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u9776\u6807\u9493\u9c7c\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53e3\u888b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u7684\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConGLUDe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u86cb\u767d\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5168\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u9690\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u4e0e\u5feb\u901f\u914d\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u914d\u4f53\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u86cb\u767d\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u53e3\u888b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cConGLUDe\u5728\u65e0\u8f93\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u53e3\u888b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9776\u6807\u9493\u9c7c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53e3\u888b\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784-\u914d\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cConGLUDe\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc8\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Hybrid Phonological Filtering for Greek Poetry Rhyme Detection and Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities across NLP tasks, struggle with phonologically-grounded phenomena like rhyme detection and generation. This is even more evident in lower-resource languages such as Modern Greek. In this paper, we present a hybrid system that combines LLMs with deterministic phonological algorithms to achieve accurate rhyme identification/analysis and generation. Our approach implements a comprehensive taxonomy of Greek rhyme types, including Pure, Rich, Imperfect, Mosaic, and Identical Pre-rhyme Vowel (IDV) patterns, and employs an agentic generation pipeline with phonological verification. We evaluate multiple prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, and RAG-augmented) across several LLMs including Claude 3.7 and 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 and open-weight models like Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and Mistral Large. Results reveal a significant \"Reasoning Gap\": while native-like models (Claude 3.7) perform intuitively (40\\% accuracy in identification), reasoning-heavy models (Claude 4.5) achieve state-of-the-art performance (54\\%) only when prompted with Chain-of-Thought. Most critically, pure LLM generation fails catastrophically (under 4\\% valid poems), while our hybrid verification loop restores performance to 73.1\\%.

Yet, manual taxonomy expansion is labor-intensive and cannot keep pace with the emergence of new concepts. Existing automated methods rely on point-based vector embeddings, which model symmetric similarity and thus struggle with the asymmetric \"is-a\" relationships that are fundamental to taxonomies. Box embeddings offer a promising alternative by enabling containment and disjointness, but they face key issues: (i) unstable gradients at the intersection boundaries, (ii) no notion of semantic uncertainty, and (iii) limited capacity to represent polysemy or ambiguity. We address these shortcomings with TaxoBell, a Gaussian box embedding framework that translates between box geometries and multivariate Gaussian distributions, where means encode semantic location and covariances encode uncertainty. Energy-based optimization yields stable optimization, robust modeling of ambiguous concepts, and interpretable hierarchical reasoning. Extensive experimentation on five benchmark datasets demonstrates that TaxoBell significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art taxonomy expansion baselines by 19% in MRR and around 25% in Recall@k.

Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff08BMM\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f0f\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u53d6\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6e90\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f29\u5c0f\u57df\u95f4\u5dee\u8ddd\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u534f\u540c\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff1b\u800c\u82e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u7f3a\u5931\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5373\u5206\u5e03\u7c07\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5c06\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8c\u5206\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff08BMM\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6811\u4e2d\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5339\u914d\u6700\u4f18\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6e90\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e90-\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cBMM\u9009\u51fa\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u57df\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u6240\u8bad\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u4e14BMM\u53ef\u4e0e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f0f\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we perform the largest semantic tagging evaluation of the rule based system that uses the lexical resources in the USAS framework covering five different languages using four existing datasets and one novel Chinese dataset. We create a new silver labelled English dataset, to overcome the lack of manually tagged training data, that we train and evaluate various mono and multilingual neural models in both mono and cross-lingual evaluation setups with comparisons to their rule based counterparts, and show how a rule based system can be enhanced with a neural network model. The resulting neural network models, including the data they were trained on, the Chinese evaluation dataset, and all of the code have been released as open resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eUSAS\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8bcd\u4e49\u6d88\u6b67\uff08WSD\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u94f6\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6587\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5355\u8bed/\u591a\u8bed\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709WSD\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u57fa\u4e8eWordNet\u3001BabelNet\u7b49\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u800cUSAS\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5f00\u3001\u5168\u9762\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u4e14\u5176\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5efa\u4e2d\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30USAS\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u82f1\u6587\u94f6\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355\u8bed/\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86USAS\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u89c4\u5219+\u795e\u7ecf\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5168\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u5747\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "USAS\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u5907\u591a\u8bed\u8a00WSD\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\u94f6\u6807\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u63a8\u52a8USAS\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

For logographic scripts, visual structure carries semantic and phonetic information, which may aid prediction. We investigate whether low-resolution visual inputs can serve as an alternative for character-level modeling. Instead of token IDs, our decoder receives grayscale images of individual characters, with resolutions as low as $8 \\times 8$ pixels. Remarkably, these inputs achieve 39.2\\% accuracy, comparable to the index-based baseline of 39.1\\%. Such low-resource settings also exhibit a pronounced \\emph{hot-start} effect: by 0.4\\% of total training, accuracy reaches above 12\\%, while index-based models lag at below 6\\%.

Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDF-DiffCom\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Kolmogorov-Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff08KAN\uff09\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f62\u53d8\u573a\u63d0\u5347\u7eb5\u5411\u8111MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u5168\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5728OASIS-3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u53ca\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u7b49\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7eb5\u5411\u8111MRI\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u56e0\u9ad8\u5931\u8bbf\u7387\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u50cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDF-DiffCom\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eKAN\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u5f62\u53d8\u573a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u8111\u5f71\u50cf\u8865\u5168\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728OASIS-3\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728OASIS-3\u4e0aPSNR\u63d0\u53475.6%\uff0cSSIM\u63d0\u53470.12\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u8de8MRI\u6a21\u6001\u53ca\u8111\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u7b49\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u7684\u8865\u5168\u3002", "conclusion": "DF-DiffCom\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5f62\u53d8\u573a\u4e0eKAN\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7eb5\u5411\u8111MRI\u8865\u5168\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated queries and answers produced from high-level task descriptions by generator LLMs. We evaluate query-answer routers (using both queries and labels) and query-only routers across four diverse benchmarks and 12 models, finding that query-answer routers degrade faster than query-only routers as generator quality decreases. Our analysis reveals two crucial characteristics of effective generators: they must accurately respond to their own questions, and their questions must produce sufficient performance differentiation among the model pool. We then show how filtering for these characteristics can improve the quality of generated data. We further propose CASCAL, a novel query-only router that estimates model correctness through consensus voting and identifies model-specific skill niches via hierarchical clustering.

Existing methods such as SparseGPT and Wanda achieve high sparsity through layer-wise weight reconstruction or activation-aware magnitude pruning, but rely on uniform or hand-crafted heuristics to determine per-layer sparsity ratios. Moreover, recent work has shown that pruned LLMs suffer from severe factual knowledge degradation, with structured pruning methods experiencing near-total collapse in factual question-answering capabilities. We introduce agent-guided pruning, where a foundation model acts as an adaptive pruning agent to intelligently select which layers to prune at each iteration while preserving critical knowledge pathways. Our method constructs layer-wise sensitivity profiles by combining Wanda-inspired weight-activation metrics with gradient importance scores, normalized as z-scores for model-agnostic comparison. These statistics are processed by an LLM agent equipped with self-reflection capabilities, enabling it to learn from previous pruning outcomes and iteratively refine its strategy. A checkpoint rollback mechanism maintains model quality by reverting when perplexity degradation exceeds a threshold. We evaluate our approach on Qwen3 models (4B and 8B parameters) at approximately 45% sparsity, demonstrating substantial improvements over structured pruning baselines: 56% relative improvement in MMLU accuracy, 19x better factual knowledge retention on FreebaseQA, and 69% lower perplexity degradation. Notably, our framework requires no retraining, operates in a model-agnostic manner, and exhibits effective self-correction with only 2-4 rollbacks across 21-40 iterations, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively guide the compression of other foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08agent-guided pruning\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u5404\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd-\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6307\u6807\u6784\u5efa\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u753b\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u56de\u6eda\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u969c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u526a\u679d\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edf\u4e00\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6bcf\u5c42\u7a00\u758f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u753b\u50cf\uff08\u878d\u5408Wanda\u5f0f\u6743\u91cd-\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5e76z-score\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u7531\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u8fed\u4ee3\u51b3\u7b56\u526a\u679d\u5c42\u4e0e\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u56de\u6eda\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen3-4B/8B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fbe~45%\u7a00\u758f\u7387\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1aMMLU\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534756%\uff0cFreebaseQA\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u63d0\u534719\u500d\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u9000\u5316\u964d\u4f4e69%\uff1b\u5168\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ec52\u20134\u6b21\u56de\u6eda\u5373\u5b8c\u621021\u201340\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u5bfc\u5176\u4ed6\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u7387\u3001\u5f3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing NLP frameworks focus on reactively labeling empathy in doctors' responses but offer limited support for anticipatory modeling of empathy needs, especially in general health queries. We introduce the Empathy Applicability Framework (EAF), a theory-driven approach that classifies patient queries in terms of the applicability of emotional reactions and interpretations, based on clinical, contextual, and linguistic cues. We release a benchmark of real patient queries, dual-annotated by Humans and GPT-4o. In the subset with human consensus, we also observe substantial human-GPT alignment. To validate EAF, we train classifiers on human-labeled and GPT-only annotations to predict empathy applicability, achieving strong performance and outperforming the heuristic and zero-shot LLM baselines. Error analysis highlights persistent challenges: implicit distress, clinical-severity ambiguity, and contextual hardship, underscoring the need for multi-annotator modeling, clinician-in-the-loop calibration, and culturally diverse annotation.

Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM).

This mechanism injects magnitude information directly into the model's input space while remaining compatible with existing tokenizers and decoder-only Transformer architectures.

While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection.

However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability.

Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization.

LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks.

Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings.

This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSRENDER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u518d\u7ed3\u54083D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b040\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5177\u8eabAI\u3001VR/AR\uff09\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc73D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u5408\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u9891\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u6240\u9700\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "SRENDER\u5728\u751f\u621020\u79d2\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb40\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCOMPOSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d23D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u5212\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6210\u5bf9\u5173\u8054\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u59ff\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u5212\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u591a23%\uff0c\u6bd4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u591a11%\u3002", "conclusion": "COMPOSE\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u89c6\u89d23D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}
