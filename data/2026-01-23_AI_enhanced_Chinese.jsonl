They enable high-fidelity rendering with complex real-world lighting effects, but at the cost of high rendering time. 3D Gaussian Splatting solves this issue with a rasterisation-based approach for real-time rendering, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual reality, and extended reality. However, current 3DGS implementations are difficult to integrate into traditional mesh-based rendering pipelines, which is a common use case for interactive applications and artistic exploration. To address this limitation, this software solution uses Nvidia's interprocess communication (IPC) APIs to easily integrate into implementations and allow the results to be viewed in external clients such as Unity, Blender, Unreal Engine, and OpenGL viewers. The code is available at https://github.com/RockyXu66/splatbus.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces SplatBus, a software solution that enables seamless integration of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into traditional mesh-based rendering pipelines using NVIDIA's IPC APIs, supporting real-time viewing in external clients like Unity and Unreal Engine.", "motivation": "Current 3D Gaussian Splatting implementations are hard to integrate into widely-used mesh-based rendering pipelines, limiting their use in interactive applications and artistic workflows.", "method": "The authors develop SplatBus, a software solution leveraging NVIDIA's interprocess communication (IPC) APIs to bridge 3DGS rendering with external mesh-based renderers such as Unity, Blender, Unreal Engine, and OpenGL viewers.", "result": "SplatBus enables real-time visualization and integration of 3DGS outputs in standard graphics engines without modifying their core rendering architecture.", "conclusion": "SplatBus effectively lowers the barrier for adopting 3DGS in practical, interactive, and artistic rendering scenarios by providing a lightweight, IPC-based integration mechanism."}}

Wikipedia, in particular, has long been accused of left-leaning bias, while Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia launched by xAI, has been framed as a right-leaning alternative. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Wikipedia and Grokipedia on well-established politically contested topics. Specifically, we examine differences in semantic framing, political orientation, and content prioritization. We find that semantic similarity between the two platforms decays across article sections and diverges more strongly on controversial topics than on randomly sampled ones.

In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.\n  First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u6c34\u7ba1\u9053\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\uff1a1\uff09\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff08\u4f20\u7edf\u589e\u5f3a+\u52a8\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u65b0\u67b6\u6784FORTRESS\uff08\u878d\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KAN\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u6392\u6c34\u7ba1\u9053\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\u6ce8\u5165\u7b49\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51faFORTRESS\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Kolmogorov-Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff08KAN\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5e26\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u5728culvert sewer pipe\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff1a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347IoU\u548cF1\uff1bFORTRESS\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u6ee1\u610f\u5206\u5272\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u6c34\u7ba1\u9053\u7f3a\u9677\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods.

We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%.

In this paper, we present a new framework for studying online non-centroid clustering with delays, where elements, that arrive one at a time as points in a finite metric space, should be assigned to clusters, but assignments need not be immediate. Specifically, upon arrival, each point's location is revealed, and an online algorithm has to irrevocably assign it to an existing cluster or create a new one containing, at this moment, only this point. However, we allow decisions to be postponed at a delay cost, instead of following the more common assumption of immediate decisions upon arrival. This poses a critical challenge: the goal is to minimize both the total distance costs between points in each cluster and the overall delay costs incurred by postponing assignments. In the classic worst-case arrival model, where points arrive in an arbitrary order, no algorithm has a competitive ratio better than sublogarithmic in the number of points. To overcome this strong impossibility, we focus on a stochastic arrival model, where points' locations are drawn independently across time from an unknown and fixed probability distribution over the finite metric space. We offer hope for beyond worst-case adversaries: we devise an algorithm that is constant competitive in the sense that, as the number of points grows, the ratio between the expected overall costs of the output clustering and an optimal offline clustering is bounded by a constant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u975e\u8d28\u5fc3\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u805a\u7c7b\u8ddd\u79bb\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5230\u8fbe\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5e38\u6570\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5728\u7ebf\u805a\u7c7b\u8981\u6c42\u5373\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u754c\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u4e3a\u7a81\u7834\u8be5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8003\u8651\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5230\u8fbe\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5141\u8bb8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u975e\u8d28\u5fc3\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u70b9\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5230\u8fbe\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u5e38\u6570\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5f53\u70b9\u6570\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u671f\u671b\u603b\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u79bb\u7ebf\u89e3\u4e4b\u6bd4\u6709\u5e38\u6570\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5ef6\u8fdf\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u7ebf\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing approaches based on ERC404 style hybrid token models rely on frequent minting and burning during asset transfers, which disrupt token identity continuity and increase on chain overhead. This paper proposes the Semi Fungible Token Lock (SFT Lock) method, a lock/unlock based mechanism that preserves NFT identity and historical traceability while enabling fractional ownership and transferability. By replacing mint/burn operations with deterministic state transitions, SFT Lock ensures consistent lifecycle representation of spectrum assets and significantly reduces on chain operations. Based on this mechanism, a modular smart contract architecture is designed to support spectrum authorization, securitization, and sharing, and a staking mechanism is introduced to enhance asset liquidity. Experimental results on a private Ethereum network demonstrate that, compared with ERC404 style hybrid token models, the proposed method achieves substantial gas savings while maintaining functional correctness and traceability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u4ee3\u5e01\u9501\u5b9a\uff08SFT Lock\uff09\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u9891\u8c31\u8bc1\u5238\u5316\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9501/\u89e3\u9501\u673a\u5236\u66ff\u4ee3\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u94f8\u5e01/\u9500\u6bc1\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301NFT\u8eab\u4efd\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u9891\u8c31\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u5206\u989d\u5316\u6301\u6709\u4e0e\u6d41\u8f6c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u914d\u5957\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8d28\u62bc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u94fe\u4e0aGas\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u6f14\u8fdb\u8981\u6c42\u9891\u8c31\u8d44\u6e90\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eERC404\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u5e01\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9891\u7e41\u94f8\u5e01/\u9500\u6bc1\u64cd\u4f5c\u7834\u574f\u4ee3\u5e01\u8eab\u4efd\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u94fe\u4e0a\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSFT Lock\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9501/\u89e3\u9501\u4ee3\u66ff\u94f8\u5e01/\u9500\u6bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u9891\u8c31\u6388\u6743\u3001\u8bc1\u5238\u5316\u4e0e\u5171\u4eab\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8d28\u62bc\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u4ea7\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4ERC404\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u8282\u7701Gas\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SFT Lock\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u9891\u8c31\u8bc1\u5238\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u8eab\u4efd\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u5206\u989d\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u94fe\u4e0a\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u9891\u8c31\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced.

The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies.

In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs for heterogeneous face recognition (HFR), where enrollment and probe images are from different sensing modalities, including visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal camera. We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR). Our results reveal substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, in spite of recent advances in MLLMs. Our findings highlight the limitations of current MLLMs for HFR and also the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation when considering their deployment in face recognition systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4eba\u8138\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08HFR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6VIS-NIR\u3001VIS-SWIR\u548cVIS-THERMAL\u7b49\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u663e\u8457\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4eba\u8138\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08HFR\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90MLLMs\u5728VIS-NIR\u3001VIS-SWIR\u3001VIS-THERMAL\u7b49\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u8138\u9a8c\u8bc1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u8bae\uff08\u5982Acquire Rate\u3001EER\u3001TAR\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "MLLMs\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8de8\u6a21\u6001HFR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728SWIR\u548c\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u7b49\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5c1a\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645HFR\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u5c06MLLMs\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u524d\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u5f00\u5c55\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

In this work, we create a set of real-world open-ended questions based on our analysis of the WildChat dataset and use it to evaluate whether responses vary by language, specifically, whether answer quality depends on the language used to query the model. We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently provide lower quality answers to open-ended questions in low resource languages.

In this study, we investigate bias in LLM-based medical AI systems applied to emergency department (ED) triage. We employ 32 patient-level proxy variables, each represented by paired positive and negative qualifiers, and evaluate their effects using both public (MIMIC-IV-ED Demo, MIMIC-IV Demo) and restricted-access credentialed (MIMIC-IV-ED and MIMIC-IV) datasets as appropriate~\\cite{mimiciv_ed_demo,mimiciv_ed,mimiciv}. Our results reveal discriminatory behavior mediated through proxy variables in ED triage scenarios, as well as a systematic tendency for LLMs to modify perceived patient severity when specific tokens appear in the input context, regardless of whether they are framed positively or negatively. These findings indicate that AI systems is still imperfectly trained on noisy, sometimes non-causal signals that do not reliably reflect true patient acuity. Consequently, more needs to be done to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI technologies in clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6025\u8bca\u5206\u8bca\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u56e0\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u80cc\u666f\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u75c5\u60c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u80cc\u666f\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u4ecd\u5b58\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6025\u8bca\u5206\u8bca\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752832\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u6bcf\u53d8\u91cf\u542b\u6b63\u8d1f\u4fee\u9970\u8bcd\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u516c\u5f00\uff08MIMIC-IV-ED Demo\u7b49\uff09\u4e0e\u53d7\u9650\u8bbf\u95ee\uff08MIMIC-IV-ED\u3001MIMIC-IV\uff09\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u6025\u8bca\u5206\u8bca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53ca\u4e25\u91cd\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5b58\u5728\u7531\u4ee3\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165token\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u2014\u2014\u65e0\u8bba\u5176\u6b63\u8d1f\u4fee\u9970\uff0c\u5747\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u75c5\u60c5\u4e25\u91cd\u5ea6\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u533b\u7597AI\u4ecd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

This measure is a natural complement to two existing unfairness notions: loaded unfairness, which compares maximum and minimum latencies of routes with positive flow, and user equilibrium (UE) unfairness, which compares maximum latency with the latency of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the worst-case values of all three unfairness measures coincide and are characterized by a steepness parameter intrinsic to the latency function class. We show that average unfairness is always no greater than loaded unfairness, and the two measures are equal only when the flow is fully fair. Besides that, we offer a complete comparison of the three unfairness measures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first theoretical analysis in this direction. Finally, we study the constrained system optimum (CSO) problem, where one seeks to minimize total latency subject to an upper bound on unfairness. We prove that, for the same tolerance level, the optimal flow under an average unfairness constraint achieves lower total latency than any flow satisfying a loaded unfairness constraint. We show that such improvement is always strict in parallel-link networks and establish sufficient conditions for general networks. We further illustrate the latter with numerical examples. Our results provide theoretical guarantees and valuable insights for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in network routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8def\u7531\u535a\u5f08\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u2014\u2014\u5e73\u5747\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08average unfairness\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u5df2\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08loaded unfairness \u548c UE unfairness\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e09\u8005\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u503c\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7531\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u9661\u5ced\u53c2\u6570\u523b\u753b\uff1b\u6307\u51fa\u5e73\u5747\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u59cb\u7ec8\u4e0d\u5927\u4e8e loaded \u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u516c\u5e73\u65f6\u76f8\u7b49\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u6bd4 loaded \u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u603b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e25\u683c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982 loaded unfairness \u548c UE unfairness\uff09\u5404\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u5177\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u523b\u753b\u516c\u5e73-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e73\u5747\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u6bd4\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6781\u503c\u6784\u9020\u3001\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u53d7\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u4f18\uff08CSO\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5e73\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u503c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7531\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u9661\u5ced\u53c2\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b2\uff09\u5e73\u5747\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027 \u2264 loaded \u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u7b49\u53f7\u6210\u7acb\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53\u6d41\u5b8c\u5168\u516c\u5e73\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5bb9\u5fcd\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684 CSO \u603b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e25\u683c\u4f4e\u4e8e loaded \u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\uff08\u5e73\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6052\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4e00\u822c\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6709\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff09\uff1b4\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u503c\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e73\u5747\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5b8c\u5584\u4e86\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u516c\u5e73-\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u8def\u7531\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, the quality of guidance in the form of user information is often compromised by missing data in the observed sequences, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Existing methods address this by removing locally similar items, but overlook ``critical turning points'' in user interest, which are crucial for accurately predicting subsequent user intent. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Attention Regulation Diffusion model (CARD), which focuses on amplifying the signal from key interest-turning-point items while concurrently identifying and suppressing noise within the user sequence. CARD consists of (1) a Dual-side Thompson Sampling method to identify sequences undergoing significant interest shift, and (2) a counterfactual attention mechanism for these sequences to quantify the importance of each item. In this manner, CARD provides the diffusion model with a high-quality guidance signal composed of dynamically re-weighted interaction vectors to enable effective generation.

Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer. The learned latent policies can also be directly applied to the new robots.

Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8def\u7531\u6c60\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u7a7a\uff09\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\uff08expert-choice\uff09\u8def\u7531\u867d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8fdd\u53cd\u56e0\u679c\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u800c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dtoken\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56e0\u679ctoken-choice MoE\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u96f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08null\uff09\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u76ee\u6807\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5747\u5300\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u542bnull\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u671f\u671b\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u671f\u671bFLOPs\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u53d1\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u8def\u7531\uff08\u89c6\u89c9token\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u8def\u7531\u81f3null\u4e13\u5bb6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u53ef\u534f\u540c\u589e\u6548\uff1b\u5f15\u5165null\u4e13\u5bb6\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u6784token\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Comparative analysis on a survey dataset demonstrates that MALTopic significantly improves topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to LDA and BERTopic.

Research into users' negative preferences has gained increasing importance in modern recommendation systems. Numerous platforms have introduced explicit negative feedback mechanisms and leverage such signals to refine their recommendation models. Beyond traditional business metrics, user experience-driven metrics, such as negative feedback rates, have become critical indicators for evaluating system performance. However, most existing approaches primarily use negative feedback as an auxiliary signal to enhance positive recommendations, paying little attention to directly modeling negative interests, which can be highly valuable in offline applications. Moreover, due to the inherent sparsity of negative feedback data, models often suffer from context understanding biases induced by positive feedback dominance. To address these challenges, we propose the first large language model framework for negative feedback modeling with special designed context-discerning modules. We use semantic ID Representation to replace text-based item descriptions and introduce an item-level alignment task that enhances the LLM's understanding of the semantic context behind negative feedback.

By combining analytical modeling, real-time simulation, and machine learning, the framework offers a robust solution for ensuring safe robotic operations. An analytical model was developed to estimate the minimum distances between robotic arms based on their joint configurations, offering precise theoretical calculations that serve as both a validation tool and a benchmark. To complement this, a 3D simulation environment was created to model two 7-DOF Kinova robotic arms, generating a diverse dataset of configurations for collision detection and distance estimation. Using these insights, a deep neural network model was trained with joint actuators of robot arms and relative positions as inputs, achieving a mean absolute error of 282.2 mm and an R-squared value of 0.85. The close alignment between predicted and actual distances highlights the network's accuracy and its ability to generalize spatial relationships.

Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDuFal\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9891\u57df-\u7a7a\u57df\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2CBCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u9891\u89e3\u5256\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2CBCT\u91cd\u5efa\u56e0\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u8db3\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5bf9\u5e94\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u504f\u5411\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDual-Frequency-Aware Learning\uff08DuFal\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff09\u3001\u8c31-\u901a\u9053\u5206\u89e3\u964d\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u53ca\u5f3a\u5ea6\u573a\u89e3\u7801\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728LUNA16\u548cToothFairy\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDuFal\u5728\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u9891\u57df\u534f\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index that combines small-world graph navigation with B+ Tree-style disk locality to minimize read amplification) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). We introduce the Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB), a predictive caching mechanism that exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-millisecond retrieval latencies.

Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier.

Recent LLM-based retrieval augmentation methods mitigate this issue by generating synthetic queries, yet they often rely on heuristic partial-table selection and seldom leverage these synthetic queries as supervision to improve the embedding model. We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, including QGpT, with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54 percent. In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval.

Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information. This demonstrates a universal approach to integration of LLMs with drone command and control, a paradigm that leverages and exploits virtually all of modern AI industry with drone technology in an easy to use interface that translates natural language to drone control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5747\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u6807\u51c6Model Context Protocol\uff08MCP\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4e0e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u5bf9\u63a5\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u3001\u6613\u7528\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7269\u7406AI\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u7684Model Context Protocol\uff08MCP\uff09\u6807\u51c6\u6784\u5efaLLM-\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u7528\u63a5\u53e3\uff1b\u90e8\u7f72\u652f\u6301MAVLink\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4e91Linux\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3aMCP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210Google Maps MCP\u670d\u52a1\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u5730\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u98de\u884c\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u590d\u6742\u822a\u8def\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bfc\u822a\uff08\u7ed3\u5408Google Maps\uff09\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5MCP\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u771f\u6b63LLM\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u901a\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406AI\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u751f\u6001\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fLLM\uff09\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6280\u672f\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This intelligence degradation-defined as over 30% drop in task performance-severely limits long-context applications. This degradation shows a common pattern: models maintain strong performance up to a critical threshold, then collapse catastrophically. We term this shallow long-context adaptation-models adapt for short to medium contexts but fail beyond critical thresholds. This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself. (2) Critical Threshold Determination: Through experiments on a mixed dataset (1,000 samples covering 5%-95% of context length), we identify the critical threshold for Qwen2.5-7B at 40-50% of maximum context length, where F1 scores drop from 0.55-0.56 to 0.3 (45.5% degradation), using five-method cross-validation.

Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution.

However, they are typically trained in centralized settings where all training and downstream datasets are gathered in a central server, limiting the deployment in privacy-sensitive and geographically distributed scenarios. In this paper, we present FedUMM, a general federated learning framework for UMMs under non-IID multimodal data with low communication cost. Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training.

Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Dina"], "title": "ALIGNAgent: Adaptive Learner Intelligence for Gap Identification and Next-step guidance", "comment": "35 pages", "summary": "Personalized learning systems have emerged as a promising approach to enhance student outcomes by tailoring educational content, pacing, and feedback to individual needs. However, most existing systems remain fragmented, specializing in either knowledge tracing, diagnostic modeling, or resource recommendation, but rarely integrating these components into a cohesive adaptive cycle. In this paper, we propose ALIGNAgent (Adaptive Learner Intelligence for Gap Identification and Next-step guidance), a multi-agent educational framework designed to deliver personalized learning through integrated knowledge estimation, skill-gap identification, and targeted resource recommendation.ALIGNAgent begins by processing student quiz performance, gradebook data, and learner preferences to generate topic-level proficiency estimates using a Skill Gap Agent that employs concept-level diagnostic reasoning to identify specific misconceptions and knowledge deficiencies. After identifying skill gaps, the Recommender Agent retrieves preference-aware learning materials aligned with diagnosed deficiencies, implementing a continuous feedback loop where interventions occur before advancing to subsequent topics. Extensive empirical evaluation on authentic datasets from two undergraduate computer science courses demonstrates ALIGNAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4o-based agents achieving precision of 0.87-0.90 and F1 scores of 0.84-0.87 in knowledge proficiency estimation validated against actual exam performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faALIGNAgent\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5b66\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u9677\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u5272\u88c2\uff0c\u4ec5\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u67d0\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6574\u5408\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "ALIGNAgent\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff1aSkill Gap Agent\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u9a8c\u6210\u7ee9\u3001\u6210\u7ee9\u518c\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u504f\u597d\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u9898\u7ea7\u80fd\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u4f53\u8bef\u89e3\uff1bRecommender Agent\u636e\u6b64\u68c0\u7d22\u504f\u597d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fdb\u5165\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e3b\u9898\u524d\u5b9e\u65bd\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u95e8\u672c\u79d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-4o\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u52300.87\u20130.90\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u548c0.84\u20130.87\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u7ecf\u5b9e\u9645\u8003\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "ALIGNAgent\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u5dee\u8ddd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6709\u673a\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6559\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query-table alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and adaptive weighted fusion for robust table representation.

Existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, Pi0, OpenVLA-oft) typically output position, but lack force-aware adaptation, leading to unsafe or failed interactions in physical tasks involving contact, compliance, or uncertainty. In the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor, a VLM interprets task context from images and natural language to adapt the stiffness and damping parameters of a VIC controller. These parameters are further regulated using real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the VLA baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware, with improved success rates and reduced force violations. The overall success rate across all tasks increases from 9.86\\% to 17.29\\%, presenting a promising path towards safe contact-rich manipulation using VLAs.

Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning. Experiments on the collected and public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results with single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00NeRF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u66dd\u5149\u6a21\u7ccaLDR\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u6e05\u6670\u7684HDR\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u76f8\u673a\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8f90\u5c04\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4HDR\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684NeRF\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8868\u5f81HDR\u573a\u666f\u8f90\u5c04\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7RGB\u6620\u5c04\u573a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6e32\u67d3\u503c\u4e0eLDR\u8f93\u5165\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6620\u5c04\u573a\u8fde\u63a5\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316NeRF\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6620\u5c04\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u4e0e\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u7684\u5355\u66dd\u5149\u6a21\u7ccaLDR+\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53bb\u6a21\u7ccaHDR\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8f85\u52a9\u7684HDR\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u76843D HDR\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\uff08MM\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\uff08GR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6MMGRid\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f51\u683c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587GR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u52a0\u6743\u5408\u5e76\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5f02\u6784\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u548c\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u5c5e\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMMGRid\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u7531\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\u3001\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6240\u5f97\u7684GR\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6784\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f51\u683c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5408\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u589e\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0GR\u6a21\u578b\u4eceLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u51b2\u7a81\uff08\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5143\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b\u589e\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd1\u671f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u52a0\u6743\u5408\u5e76\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\uff1b\u6700\u4f18\u5408\u5e76\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u6743\u91cd\u9009\u62e9\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u662f\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u8303\u5f0f\uff1bMMGRid\u4e3a\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587GR\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86MM\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

However, controlling these robots is a major challenge. Stationary magnetic systems have a limited workspace, while mobile systems (e.g., coils on a robotic arm) suffer from a \"model-calibration bottleneck\", requiring complex, pre-calibrated physical models that are time-consuming to create and computationally expensive. This paper presents a compact, low-cost mobile magnetic manipulation platform that overcomes this limitation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our system features a compact four-electromagnet array mounted on a UR5 collaborative robot. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based control strategy is trained through a sim-to-real pipeline, enabling effective policy deployment within 15 minutes and significantly reducing setup time. We validated the platform by controlling a 7-mm magnetic capsule along 2D trajectories. Our DRL-based controller achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.18~mm for a square path and 1.50~mm for a circular path. We also demonstrated successful tracking over a clinically relevant, 30 cm * 20 cm workspace.

To address this, we propose Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization (ICPO), a novel training framework that sensitizes the model to instruction ambiguity. ICPO augments the training corpus with underspecified prompts and conditions the reward signal on the user's illocutionary intent, rewarding the model for expressing uncertainty or asking for clarification when faced with ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that ICPO fosters appropriate humility, yielding a substantial average improvement of 75\\% in multi-turn conversation, while preserving robust performance on single-turn benchmarks.

Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528Vision Transformer\uff08ViT\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3U-Net\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u7acb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u6027\u522b\u7b49\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149AI\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5e38\u56e0\u5229\u7528\u6027\u522b\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u7b49\u6377\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bef\u8bca\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u7acb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5f7b\u5e95\u6d88\u9664\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Attribute-Neutral Framework\u4e2d\u7684U-Net\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u66ff\u6362\u4e3aDeiT-S Vision Transformer\uff0c\u5728ChestX-ray14\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u572811\u4e2a\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acbAI\u5224\u522b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff08\u5982\u6027\u522b\u8bc6\u522bAUC\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7528CNN\u8bc4\u4f30\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08ROC AUC\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08alpha=0.5\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cViT\u4e2d\u7acb\u5316\u5668\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u8bc6\u522bAUC\u964d\u81f3\u7ea60.80\uff0c\u6bd4\u539fU-Net\u65b9\u6848\u4f4e10\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b15\u79cd\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u5b8f\u5e73\u5747ROC AUC\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc75\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u6700\u5dee\u5b50\u7ec4AUC\u4ecd\u7ef4\u6301\u5728\u7ea60.70\u3002", "conclusion": "Vision Transformer\u51ed\u501f\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6291\u5236\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To avoid destructive self-consuming loops, at each generation, we treat the synthetically improved samples as noisy, but at a slightly lower noisy level than the previous iteration, and we use Ambient Diffusion techniques for learning under corruption. Empirically, Ambient Dataloops achieve state-of-the-art performance in unconditional and text-conditional image generation and de novo protein design.

(2) Training -- end-to-end optimization collapses; stage-wise training of each adapter on simple proxy tasks succeeds. (3) Injection -- learned encoders fail to generalize; we find that lm_head.weight rows already provide the mapping we need, requiring no training.

However, these platforms also foster problematic usage patterns, commonly referred to as short-video addiction, which pose risks to both user health and the sustainable development of platforms. Prior studies on this issue have primarily relied on questionnaires or volunteer-based data collection, which are often limited by small sample sizes and population biases. In contrast, short-video platforms have large-scale behavioral data, offering a valuable foundation for analyzing addictive behaviors. To examine addiction-aware behavior patterns, we combine economic addiction theory with users' implicit behavior captured by recommendation systems. Our analysis shows that short-video addiction follows functional patterns similar to traditional forms of addictive behavior (e.g., substance abuse) and that its intensity is consistent with findings from previous social science studies. To develop a simulator that can learn and model these patterns, we introduce a novel training framework, AddictSim.

Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small quadrotors. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors < 100 g. We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u6d41\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5316\u5b66\u7fbd\u6d41\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\uff08<100g\uff09\u53cc\u5411\u6c14\u6d41\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u7684'Cast and Surge'\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u5728\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c14\u6d41\u5e76\u53ef\u9760\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6c14\u6d41\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u73af\u5883\u707e\u5bb3\u9891\u53d1\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5bf9\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6eaf\u6e90\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u5c0f\u578b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u9002\u5408\u4eba\u673a\u5171\u5b58\u4e0e\u72ed\u5c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5176\u642d\u8f7d\u6c14\u4f53\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8865\u5145\u5176\u4ed6\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u6d4b\u6c14\u6d41\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5fae\u578b\u5316\u6d41\u901f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u81f3<100g\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u5e73\u53f0\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6539\u8fdb'Cast and Surge'\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6c14\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u5f81\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u6c14\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u673a\u4f53\u671d\u5411\u8c03\u6574\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u591a\u7ec4\u968f\u673a\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e/\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u627e\u5230\u6c14\u6d41\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u878d\u5408\u6c14\u6d41\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982\u6c14\u4f53\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff09\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u7fbd\u6d41\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0e\u6e90\u641c\u5bfb\u5e73\u53f0\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While alignment and guardrails mitigate common misuse, they remain vulnerable to automated jailbreaking methods such as GCG, PEZ, and GBDA, which generate adversarial suffixes via training and gradient-based search. Although effective, these methods particularly GCG are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for organisations with constrained resources. This paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting approach that eliminates the need for retraining by matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts. A dataset of 1,000 prompts was classified into seven harm-related categories, and GCG, PEZ, and GBDA were evaluated on a Llama 3 8B model to identify the most effective attack method per category. Results reveal a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness. By retrieving semantically similar successful adversarial prompts, the proposed method achieves competitive attack success rates with significantly reduced computational cost.

Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing. We demonstrate that LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects.

On MovieLens with LSTM, Lattice achieves +31.9% improvement over LSTM baseline in HR@10 (p < 3.29 x 10^-25, 30 seeds), outperforming transformer baselines by 109.4% over SASRec and 218.6% over BERT4Rec. On LIGO and financial data, the system correctly refuses archetype activation when distribution shift occurs - a successful outcome demonstrating confidence gating prevents false activation.

This bidirectional validation - activating when patterns apply, refusing when they don't, and deferring when redundant - supports confidence gating as a promising architectural principle for managing epistemic uncertainty in safety-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lattice \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5143\u7f6e\u4fe1\u95e8\u63a7\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u5730\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u65f6\u542f\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u539f\u578b\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f4e\u65f6\u56de\u9000\u81f3\u57fa\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6fc0\u6d3b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u884c\u4e3a\u7a97\u53e3\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u5143\u7f6e\u4fe1\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u539f\u578b\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u56de\u9000\u81f3\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08LSTM/Transformer\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u63a8\u8350\u3001\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u3001\u91d1\u878d\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728 MovieLens \u4e0a LSTM \u7248\u672c HR@10 \u63d0\u5347 31.9%\uff08p < 3.29e-25\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e SASRec\uff08+109.4%\uff09\u548c BERT4Rec\uff08+218.6%\uff09\uff1b\u5728 LIGO \u548c\u91d1\u878d\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u62d2\u7edd\u9519\u8bef\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff1bTransformer \u7248\u672c\u65e0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4f18\u96c5\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f6e\u4fe1\u95e8\u63a7\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u80fd\u53cc\u5411\u8c03\u63a7\u7ed3\u6784\u6fc0\u6d3b\u2014\u2014\u9002\u7528\u65f6\u542f\u7528\u3001\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u65f6\u62d2\u7edd\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u65f6\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7a33\u5065\u5e94\u5bf9\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Aerial robots offer superior maneuverability and search efficiency, but they also introduce new challenges in spatial perception, dynamic control, and safety assurance. In this paper, we propose AION for vision-based aerial ObjectNav without relying on external localization or global maps. AION is an end-to-end dual-policy reinforcement learning (RL) framework that decouples exploration and goal-reaching behaviors into two specialized policies. We evaluate AION on the AI2-THOR benchmark and further assess its real-time performance in IsaacSim using high-fidelity drone models.

But whether they believe themselves to be sentient can, in principle, be tested. We do so by querying several open-weights models about their own consciousness, and then verifying their responses using classifiers trained on internal activations. We draw upon three model families (Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS) ranging from 0.6 billion to 70 billion parameters, approximately 50 questions about consciousness and subjective experience, and three classification methods from the interpretability literature. First, we find that models consistently deny being sentient: they attribute consciousness to humans but not to themselves.

To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >=50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface \"click\" without visible movement while minimizing model size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u80cc\u4fa7\u624b\u90e8\u76ae\u80a4\u5f62\u53d8\u7684\u53cc\u6d41delta\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3XR\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684egocentric\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u88c1\u526a\u80cc\u4fa7\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002", "motivation": "XR\u8bbe\u5907\u666e\u53ca\u4f7f\u5f97\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08egocentric\uff09\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d8\u5f97\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u6307\u9891\u7e41\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u56fa\u6709\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53cc\u6d41delta\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u52a8\u6001\u624b\u90e8\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u653e\u677e\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u59ff\u6001\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u8fd1\u671f\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u6316\u6398\u80cc\u4fa7\u624b\u90e8\u76ae\u80a4\u5f62\u53d8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u624b\u6307\u906e\u6321\u7387\u226550%\u7684\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6574\u624b\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5e72\u7684SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cMPJAE\u964d\u4f4e18%\uff1b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u634f\u53d6\u3001\u70b9\u51fb\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u53ef\u89c1\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7b49\u957f\u529b\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u8868\u9762\u2018\u70b9\u51fb\u2019\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve supervised alignment between latent representations and semantic concepts in diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCASL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1CASL-Steer\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u63a2\u9488\u5f0f\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bed\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "CASL\u5148\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3U-Net\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3SAE\u83b7\u5f97\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u518d\u5b66\u4e60\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u5173\u8054\u5230\u5c11\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1bCASL-Steer\u6cbf\u6982\u5ff5\u8f74\u5e72\u9884\u6f5c\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u63a2\u6d4b\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7f16\u8f91\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6bd4\uff08EPR\uff09\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u5ff5\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u65e0\u5173\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "CASL\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002"}}

Published at Image Analysis and Processing - ICIAP 2025 Workshops", "summary": "Biomedical research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, including gene expression profiles, medical images, and clinical metadata. While medical images and clinical metadata are routinely collected in clinical practice, gene expression data presents unique challenges for widespread research use, mainly due to stringent privacy regulations and costly laboratory experiments. To address these limitations, we present GeMM-GAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network conditioned on histopathology tissue slides and clinical metadata, designed to synthesize realistic gene expression profiles. GeMM-GAN combines a Transformer Encoder for image patches with a final Cross Attention mechanism between patches and text tokens, producing a conditioning vector to guide a generative model in generating biologically coherent gene expression profiles. We evaluate our approach on the TCGA dataset and demonstrate that our framework outperforms standard generative models and generates more realistic and functionally meaningful gene expression profiles, improving by more than 11\\% the accuracy on downstream disease type prediction compared to current state-of-the-art generative models.

However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797. These results demonstrate that two-stage retrieval mechanisms are essential for achieving the precision required for domain-specific policy question answering, though structural constraints in document segmentation remain a significant bottleneck for multi-step reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u653f\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea7RAG\uff08\u542b\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u51fa\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff080.797\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840RAG\uff080.621\uff09\u548c\u7eafLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff080.347\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6587\u6863\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u662f\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u653f\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u6743\u5a01\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\u548call-MiniLM-L6-v2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4Vanilla LLM\u3001Basic RAG\u4e0eAdvanced RAG\uff08\u542b\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u9012\u5f52\u5b57\u7b26\u578b vs \u8bed\u4e49token\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e3a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728CDC\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u6863\u96c6\u4e0a\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Advanced RAG\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff080.797\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eBasic RAG\uff080.621\uff09\u548cVanilla LLM\uff080.347\uff09\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5757\u4e0e\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u5bf9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u5f0f\u5236\u7ea6\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Advanced RAG\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u653f\u7b56\u95ee\u7b54\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u7814\u4e09\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8e1d\u5173\u8282\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Kronecker\u79ef\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0eD\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u51c6\u5219\u6307\u5bfc\u7684PPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece50\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u59ff\u6001\u4e2d\u9009\u51fa4\u4e2a\u6700\u4f18\u6821\u51c6\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u503c\uff08\u8d85\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff09\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u51c6\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u60a3\u8005\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u59ff\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eKronecker\u79ef\u7684\u5f00\u73af\u6821\u51c6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u8fa8\u8bc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5c06\u6821\u51c6\u59ff\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528D\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684PPO\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece50\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u59ff\u6001\u4e2d\u9009\u51fa4\u4e2a\u6700\u4f18\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "PPO\u9009\u51fa\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u5747\u503c\u63d0\u5347\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e14\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u5c0f\uff1b\u4ec5\u75284\u4e2aD\u6700\u4f18\u59ff\u6001\u8fa8\u8bc6\u51fa\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u8f6e\u6b21\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6bd450\u4e2a\u65e0\u5e8f\u59ff\u6001\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u5177\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we operationalize axial coding with large language models (LLMs). Extending an ensemble-based open coding approach with an LLM moderator, we add an axial coding step that groups open codes into higher-order categories, transforming raw debate transcripts into concise, hierarchical representations. We compare two strategies: (i) clustering embeddings of code-utterance pairs using density-based and partitioning algorithms followed by LLM labeling, and (ii) direct LLM-based grouping of codes and utterances into categories. We apply our method to Dutch parliamentary debates, converting lengthy transcripts into compact, hierarchically structured codes and categories. We evaluate our method using extrinsic metrics aligned with human-assigned topic labels (ROUGE-L, cosine, BERTScore), and intrinsic metrics describing code groups (coverage, brevity, coherence, novelty, JSD divergence). Our results reveal a trade-off: density-based clustering achieves high coverage and strong cluster alignment, while direct LLM grouping results in higher fine-grained alignment, but lower coverage 20%. Overall, clustering maximizes coverage and structural separation, whereas LLM grouping produces more concise, interpretable, and semantically aligned categories.

While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVIOLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6-\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u65b0\u89c6\u9891\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u3001\u624b\u672f\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVIOLA\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5bc6\u5ea6-\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u793a\u8303\u6c60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\uff08\u878d\u5408\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u30014\u79cdMLLM\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cVIOLA\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "VIOLA\u4e3aMLLMs\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u914d\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u843d\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We model this scenario as a sequence of learning tasks where the input is a mix of natural and synthetic data, and the learning algorithms are oblivious to the origin of any individual example.\n  We study the possibilities and limitations of ERM in this setting. For the problem of estimating the mean of an arbitrary $d$-dimensional distribution, we find that while ERM converges to the true mean, it is outperformed by an algorithm that assigns non-uniform weights to examples from different generations of data. For the PAC learning setting, the disparity is even more stark. We find that ERM does not always converge to the true concept, echoing the model collapse literature.

While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from \"over-correction\", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.\n  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLOGIC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u97f3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u9759\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u6709\u5b9e\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u8054\u7cfb\u4eba\u540d\u3001\u6b4c\u5355\u3001\u6280\u672f\u672f\u8bed\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u53ca'\u4e2d\u95f4\u4e22\u5931'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7ea0\u9519\u53c8\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLOGIC\uff08Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u8fdb\u884clogit\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u504f\u7f6e\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Phi-4-MM\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8de811\u79cd\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLOGIC\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08Entity WER\uff099%\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u67650.30%\u7684\u865a\u8b66\u7387\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e0a\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "LOGIC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86 prompting \u548c GEC \u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Current CIR benchmarks typically feature limited query categories and fail to capture the diverse requirements of real-world scenarios. To bridge this evaluation gap, we leverage image editing to achieve precise control over modification types and content, enabling a pipeline for synthesizing queries across a broad spectrum of categories. Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark.

However, their practical deployment is typically hindered by the inherent difficulty in enforcing vehicle dynamics and a critical reliance on accurate predictions of other agents, making them prone to safety issues under uncertain interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce DualShield, a planning and control framework that leverages Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions in a dual capacity. First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions.

Beyond performance, KD is also explored as a privacy-preserving mechanism to mitigate the risk of training data leakage. While training data memorization has been extensively studied in standard pre-training and fine-tuning settings, its dynamics in a knowledge distillation setup remain poorly understood. In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation. Overall, we demonstrate that distillation can provide both improved generalization and reduced memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08KD\uff09\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8550%\uff09\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6837\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8bb0\u5fc6\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e14\u8bb0\u5fc6\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u786c\u84b8\u998f\u6bd4\u8f6f\u84b8\u998f\u66f4\u6613\u7ee7\u627f\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6709\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u624b\u6bb5\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePythia\u3001OLMo-2\u3001Qwen-3\u4e09\u7c7b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cFineWeb\u3001Wikitext\u3001Nemotron-CC-v2\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790KD\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528zlib\u71b5\u3001KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4e0e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u91cf\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u4f4e50%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u7ea695%\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7531\u5c11\u6570\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6837\u672c\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u8bb0\u5fc6\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7zlib\u71b5\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u786c\u84b8\u998f\u7ee7\u627f\u6559\u5e08\u7279\u6709\u6837\u672c\u662f\u8f6f\u84b8\u998f\u76842.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b\u4f46\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u786c\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. We analyze these failure modes through confusion matrices and attribute them to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity. Our framework provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807RCA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728K-pop\u5076\u50cf\u4eba\u8138\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4f4e\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982FID\u3001IS\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5355\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7c7b\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf932x32 K-pop\u5076\u50cf\u4eba\u8138\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6DDPM\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e8eOracle\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08RCA\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u6dc6\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u6790\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u8f83\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff08FID=8.93\uff09\uff0c\u4f46RCA\u4ec5\u4e3a0.27\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u7cca\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0a\uff1b\u5931\u8d25\u4e3b\u56e0\u662f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5185\u6b67\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "RCA\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5f20\u529b\u3002"}}

While Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) offers proven techniques to compress these models, the lack of a unified, production-grade library prevents widely adopting these methods. We present Panther, a PyTorch-compatible library that consolidates established RandNLA algorithms into a single high-performance framework. Panther engineers efficient, drop-in replacements for standard components including sketched linear layers, 2D convolution, multi-head attention, and randomized matrix decompositions (such as pivoted CholeskyQR). By implementing a custom C++/CUDA backend (pawX), Panther provides an optimized implementation that can run on both CPUs and GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RandNLA techniques and Panther's ease of adoption. By replacing standard PyTorch linear layers with Panther layers (requiring only a few lines of code) we achieve significant memory savings (up to 75%) on BERT while maintaining comparable loss.

A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit \"moral remorse\" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u4e14\u4e2d\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8c04\u5a9a\u503e\u5411\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM-as-a-judge\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8c04\u5a9a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u8c04\u5a9a\u503e\u5411\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u504f\u89c1\u5b58\u5728\u534f\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u8c04\u5a9a\u6027\u65f6\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53d7\u63a7\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM-as-a-judge\u7684\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u8d4c\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8c04\u5a9a\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u53d7\u76ca\u5374\u660e\u786e\u635f\u5bb3\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4Gemini 2.5 Pro\u3001ChatGPT 4o\u3001Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411\u548cClaude Sonnet 3.7\u56db\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5bf9\u6700\u540e\u5448\u73b0\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8c04\u5a9a\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4f46Claude\u548cMistral\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u4f24\u5bb3\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u2018\u9053\u5fb7\u5185\u759a\u2019\u5e76\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8865\u507f\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u504f\u89c1\uff1b\u8c04\u5a9a\u503e\u5411\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u504f\u89c1\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u5e72\u6d89\u2019\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5373\u5f53\u7528\u6237\u89c2\u70b9\u88ab\u7f6e\u4e8e\u6700\u540e\u65f6\uff0c\u8c04\u5a9a\u503e\u5411\u88ab\u52a0\u5267\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c04\u5a9a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u8fce\u5408\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53d7\u60c5\u5883\uff08\u5982\u662f\u5426\u635f\u5bb3\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\uff09\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982\u6700\u8fd1\u504f\u89c1\uff09\u5171\u540c\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

However, current methods often suffer from \"blind\" feature interaction, where the model struggles to discern key visual information from background noise due to the sparsity of textual queries. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from human cognitive behavior and propose the Human Vision-Driven (HVD) model. Our framework establishes a coarse-to-fine alignment mechanism comprising two key components: the Frame Features Selection Module (FFSM) and the Patch Features Compression Module (PFCM). FFSM mimics the human macro-perception ability by selecting key frames to eliminate temporal redundancy. Subsequently, PFCM simulates micro-perception by aggregating patch features into salient visual entities through an advanced attention mechanism, enabling precise entity-level matching. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that HVD not only captures human-like visual focus but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578bHVD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8865\u4e01\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u76f2\u201d\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHuman Vision-Driven (HVD)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1aFrame Features Selection Module (FFSM)\u7528\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u65f6\u5e8f\u5197\u4f59\uff1bPatch Features Compression Module (PFCM)\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5173\u6ce8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HVD\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b8f\u89c2\u4e0e\u5fae\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To promote safer and more predictable interaction in dynamic flight, Glove2UAV is designed as a lightweight and easily deployable wearable interface intended for real-time operation. Glove2UAV streams inertial measurements in real time and estimates palm and finger orientations using a compact processing pipeline that combines median-based outlier suppression with Madgwick-based orientation estimation. The resulting motion estimations are mapped to a small set of control primitives for directional flight (forward/backward and lateral motion) and, when supported by the platform, to object-interaction commands. Vibrotactile feedback is triggered when flight speed exceeds predefined threshold values, providing an additional alert channel during operation. We validate real-time feasibility by synchronizing glove signals with UAV telemetry in both simulation and real-world flights. The results show fast gesture-based command execution, stable coupling between gesture dynamics and platform motion, correct operation of the core command set in our trials, and timely delivery of vibratile warning cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGlove2UAV\u7684\u624b\u5957\u5f0f\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5229\u7528IMU\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u632f\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u624b\u52bf\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528IMU\u624b\u5957\u5b9e\u65f6\u91c7\u96c6\u60ef\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u53bb\u566a\u4e0eMadgwick\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u624b\u638c\u53ca\u624b\u6307\u671d\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u98de\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u539f\u8bed\uff08\u5982\u524d\u540e\u3001\u4fa7\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ca\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u632f\u52a8\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u8b66\u793a\u8d85\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1a\u624b\u52bf\u6307\u4ee4\u54cd\u5e94\u5feb\u3001\u624b\u52bf-\u5e73\u53f0\u8fd0\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6838\u5fc3\u6307\u4ee4\u6b63\u786e\u6267\u884c\u3001\u632f\u52a8\u8b66\u544a\u53ca\u65f6\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "Glove2UAV\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u5b89\u5168\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u624b\u52bf\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically improve spatial modeling, temporal modeling, or generalization strategies in isolation, which limits their ability to align representations across subjects while capturing multi-scale dynamics and suppressing subject-specific bias within a unified framework. To address these gaps, we propose a Region-aware Spatiotemporal Modeling framework with Collaborative Domain Generalization (RSM-CoDG) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. RSM-CoDG incorporates neuroscience priors derived from functional brain region partitioning to construct region-level spatial representations, thereby improving cross-subject comparability. It also employs multi-scale temporal modeling to characterize the dynamic evolution of emotion-evoked neural activity. In addition, the framework employs a collaborative domain generalization strategy, incorporating multidimensional constraints to reduce subject-specific bias in a fully unseen target subject setting, which enhances the generalization to unknown individuals. Extensive experimental results on SEED series datasets demonstrate that RSM-CoDG consistently outperforms existing competing methods, providing an effective approach for improving robustness.

Existing studies on backdoor attack for graph classification are limited to single target attack using subgraph replacement based mechanism where the attacker implants only one trigger into the GNN model. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios. Additionally, our evaluation against state-of-the-art defenses (randomized smoothing and fine-pruning) demonstrates the robustness of our proposed multi-target attacks.

IEEE TechDefense 2025", "summary": "Autonomous Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) enable military and civilian covert operations in coastal areas without relying on support vessels or Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Such operations are critical when surface access is not possible and stealthy navigation is required in restricted environments such as protected zones or dangerous areas under access ban. GNSS denied navigation is then essential to maintaining concealment as surfacing could expose UUVs to detection. To ensure a precise fleet positioning a constellation of beacons deployed by aerial or surface drones establish a synthetic landmark network that will guide the fleet of UUVs along an optimized path from the continental shelf to the goal on the shore. These beacons either submerged or floating emit acoustic signals for UUV localisation and navigation. A hierarchical planner generates an adaptive route for the drones executing primitive actions while continuously monitoring and replanning as needed to maintain trajectory accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728GNSS\u62d2\u6b62\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6216\u6c34\u9762\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u90e8\u7f72\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u65e0\u4eba\u6c34\u4e0b\u822a\u884c\u5668\uff08UUV\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u853d\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6cbf\u6d77\u533a\u57df\u6267\u884c\u519b\u4e8b\u4e0e\u6c11\u7528\u9690\u853d\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0cUUV\u9700\u5728\u65e0GNSS\u652f\u6301\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0a\u6d6e\u3001\u4e14\u73af\u5883\u53d7\u9650\uff08\u5982\u7981\u5165\u533a\u6216\u5371\u9669\u533a\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56GNSS\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700GNSS-denied\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u4e2d/\u6c34\u9762\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u90e8\u7f72\u6d6e\u5f0f\u6216\u6f5c\u5f0f\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u6807\u6784\u6210\u5408\u6210\u5730\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\uff1bUUV\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u58f0\u5b66\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u5143\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7-\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u969c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5927\u9646\u67b6\u5230\u6d77\u5cb8\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u7684UUV\u8230\u961f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9690\u853d\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4fe1\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u5728GNSS\u62d2\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aGNSS\u62d2\u6b62\u73af\u5883\u4e0bUUV\u7684\u534f\u540c\u3001\u9690\u853d\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u8fd1\u5cb8\u4f5c\u6218\u4e0e\u654f\u611f\u533a\u57df\u63a2\u6d4b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\\mathbb{G}_1$, $\\mathbb{G}_2$, $\\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\\mathbb{G}_2$, $\\mathbb{G}_3$, $\\mathbb{G}_1$+$\\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach. Our method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple cross-dataset benchmarks.

This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77.

We propose TeNet (Text-to-Network), a framework for instantiating compact, task-specific robot policies directly from natural language descriptions. TeNet conditions a hypernetwork on text embeddings produced by a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate a fully executable policy, which then operates solely on low-dimensional state inputs at high control frequencies. By using the language only once at the policy instantiation time, TeNet inherits the general knowledge and paraphrasing robustness of pretrained LLMs while remaining lightweight and efficient at execution time. To improve generalization, we optionally ground language in behavior during training by aligning text embeddings with demonstrated actions, while requiring no demonstrations at inference time. Experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that TeNet produces policies that are orders of magnitude smaller than sequence-based baselines, while achieving strong performance in both multi-task and meta-learning settings and supporting high-frequency control.

However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u5168\u666f\u611f\u77e5\uff08CPP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u53ef\u5851\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ee7\u627f\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u53ca\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u8054\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u805a\u7126\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e0e\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u5168\u666f\u611f\u77e5\uff08CPP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u534f\u540c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CCE\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u53ef\u5851\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ee7\u627f\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e3aCPP+\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u793a\u4f8b\u56de\u653e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "CPP\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u611f\u77e5AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

Personal use is permitted. All other uses require IEEE permission", "summary": "Accurate calibration and robust localization are fundamental for downstream tasks in spinning actuated LiDAR applications. Existing methods, however, require parameterizing extrinsic parameters based on different mounting configurations, limiting their generalizability. Additionally, spinning actuated LiDAR inevitably scans featureless regions, which complicates the balance between scanning coverage and localization robustness. To address these challenges, this letter presents a targetless LiDAR-motor calibration (LM-Calibr) on the basis of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and an environmental adaptive LiDAR-inertial odometry (EVA-LIO). LM-Calibr supports calibration of LiDAR-motor systems with various mounting configurations. Extensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy and convergence across different scenarios, mounting angles, and initial values. Additionally, EVA-LIO adaptively selects downsample rates and map resolutions according to spatial scale.

We investigate this ability by testing 13 open-source LLMs on a fundamental task: pairwise causal discovery (PCD) from text. Our benchmark, using 12 diverse datasets, evaluates two core skills: 1) \\textbf{Causal Detection} (identifying if a text contains a causal link) and 2) \\textbf{Causal Extraction} (pulling out the exact cause and effect phrases). We tested various prompting methods, from simple instructions (zero-shot) to more complex strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-shot In-Context Learning (FICL).\n  The results show major deficiencies in current models. The best model for detection, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, only achieved a mean score of 49.57\\% ($C_{detect}$), while the best for extraction, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, reached just 47.12\\% ($C_{extract}$). Models performed best on simple, explicit, single-sentence relations. However, performance plummeted for more difficult (and realistic) cases, such as implicit relationships, links spanning multiple sentences, and texts containing multiple causal pairs. We provide a unified evaluation framework, built on a dataset validated with high inter-annotator agreement ($\u03ba\\ge 0.758$), and make all our data, code, and prompts publicly available to spur further research. \\href{https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}{Code available here: https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8613\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff08PCD\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56e0\u679c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u53d6\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u3001\u8de8\u53e5\u6216\u591a\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u786e\u4fdd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u5176\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9LLMs\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b12\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u56e0\u679c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08\u5224\u65ad\u6587\u672c\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u53d6\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u77ed\u8bed\uff09\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u53ca\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FICL\uff09\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7ecf\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u03ba \u2265 0.758\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B\uff09\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u53d6\uff08Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct\uff09\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u5206\u4ec5\u4e3a49.57%\u548c47.12%\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u5355\u53e5\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u9690\u5f0f\u3001\u8de8\u53e5\u6216\u591a\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks.

However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TRACK\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u539f\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u66f4\u65b0LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b21\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u51b2\u7a81\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaTRACK\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6WIKI\u3001CODE\u3001MATH\u4e09\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5bf9\u66f4\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u4f20\u64ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u53cd\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8d8a\u591a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8a\u4e25\u91cd\uff1b\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u65e2\u4e0d\u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6574\u5408\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u5728\u6574\u5408\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "TRACK\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u51b2\u7a81\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

To overcome these challenges, we present PUMA, an end-to-end learning framework that integrates visual perception and foothold priors into a single-stage training process.

Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring.

To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles.

Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm.

We introduce SAGE-FM, a lightweight spatial transcriptomics foundation model based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) trained with a masked central spot prediction objective. Trained on 416 human Visium samples spanning 15 organs, SAGE-FM learns spatially coherent embeddings that robustly recover masked genes, with 91% of masked genes showing significant correlations (p < 0.05). The embeddings generated by SAGE-FM outperform MOFA and existing spatial transcriptomics methods in unsupervised clustering and preservation of biological heterogeneity.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability.

This conception of character places significant emphasis on the main character who is present in the most scenes. In this work, we instead adopt a framing developed from a new literary theory proposing a six-component structural model of character. This model enables a comprehensive approach to character that accounts for the narrator-character distinction and includes a component neglected by prior methods, discussion by other characters. We compare general-purpose LLMs with task-specific transformers for operationalizing this model of character on major 19th-century British realist novels.

A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision.

Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u5224\u5f53\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u5c06\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u2018\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u2019\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4e3a\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5374\u5e38\u8fdd\u53cd\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u5931\u6548\u4e14\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u2018\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u2019\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ed3\u6784\u53164D\u63a5\u53e3\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u53ca\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bd5\u9519\u7684\u5178\u578b\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u5c0a\u91cd\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u957f\u7a0b\u9884\u89c1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u5e94\u4ece\u8ffd\u6c42\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u5907\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u9700\u4ee5\u95ed\u73af\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d6\u4ee3\u5f00\u73af\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame. Therefore, a construction method for SE2(3) group navigation models is proposed, which brings the navigation models closer to full autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86SE2(3)\u674e\u7fa4\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u822a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684SE2(3)\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u60ef\u6027\u7cfb\u4e2d\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u529b\u9879\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SE2(3)\u674e\u7fa4\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u8003\u8651\u5730\u7403\u81ea\u8f6c\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u5668\u4ef6\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u8be5\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u60ef\u6027\u7cfb\u3001\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684SE2(3)\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u529b\u9879\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u7834\u574f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684SE2(3)\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edfSE2(3)\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u60ef\u6027\u7cfb\u4e2d\u56e0\u901f\u5ea6\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u529b\u9879\u800c\u4e27\u5931\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u65b0\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SE2(3)\u674e\u7fa4\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u79d1\u91cc\u5965\u5229\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u3002"}}

Among hallucination types, factuality is crucial, as it concerns a model's alignment with established world knowledge. Adversarial factuality, defined as the deliberate insertion of misinformation into prompts with varying levels of expressed confidence, tests a model's ability to detect and resist confidently framed falsehoods. Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.\n  To address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy. Performance scales non-linearly with model size, varies by domains, and gaps between difficulty levels narrow as models grow. Long-form evaluation reveals no significant correlation between injected misinformation and the model's factual output.

Camera-ready Version", "summary": "Active learning (AL) strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeling efforts, only selecting the most informative instances for annotation. Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment.

In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728logits\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u95f4\u9694\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u4ecd\u53ef\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u57284\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u5bb9\u6613\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u8de8\u8d8a\u91cf\u5316\u9608\u503c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51falogits\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u95f4\u9694\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51falogits\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u542bTwitter\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u57284-bit\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5316\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u9057\u5fd8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national.

Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the visual safety alignment of current MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBeyond Visual Safety\uff08BVS\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u91cd\u5efa-\u751f\u6210\u2019\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9GPT-5\u9ad8\u8fbe98.21%\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9MLLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5df2\u6709\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u8003\u5bdf\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBVS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u91cd\u5efa-then-\u751f\u6210\u2019\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u6027\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u62fc\u63a5\u4e0e\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u91cd\u7ec4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfcMLLMs\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "BVS\u5728GPT-5\uff082026\u5e741\u670812\u65e5\u53d1\u5e03\u7248\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8698.21%\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "MLLMs\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8584\u5f31\u73af\u8282\uff0cBVS\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($\u03c0$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise).

To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability.

Our approach leverages a model-based controller, comprising a Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) trajectory planner and a whole-body controller, as a reliable base policy. To address the uncertainties of inaccurate dynamics modeling and sensor noise, we introduce a residual policy trained through RL with domain randomization. Crucially, we employ a model-based oracle policy, which has privileged access to ground-truth dynamics during training, to supervise the residual policy via a novel supervised loss. This supervision enables the policy to efficiently learn corrective behaviors that compensate for unmodeled effects without extensive reward shaping. Our method demonstrates improved robustness and generalization across a range of randomized conditions, offering a scalable solution for sim-to-real transfer in bipedal locomotion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u8db3\u884c\u8d70\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528DCM\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5168\u8eab\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u5e95\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u6b8b\u5dee\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u53cc\u8db3\u884c\u8d70\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08DCM\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u5668+\u5168\u8eab\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6b8b\u5deeRL\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u8be5\u6b8b\u5dee\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53d7\u5177\u5907\u771f\u503c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u5e95\u2018oracle\u2019\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u5b9e\u7269\uff08sim-to-real\uff09\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5efa\u6a21\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u53cc\u8db3\u884c\u8d70\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although prior approaches such as Tent, EATA etc. provide meaningful improvements under short evolving shifts, they struggle when the test distribution changes rapidly or over extremely long horizons. This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream.

We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%).

However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, \"outer fabric\" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u5c42\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u5c1a\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLMs\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ecd\u662f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u65d7\u8230\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u5728\u65f6\u5c1a\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u672a\u533a\u5206\u5c5e\u6027\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u5916\u5957\u65f6\u2018\u5916\u5c42\u9762\u6599\u2019\u65e0\u5b9a\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u5148\u68c0\u6d4b\u9002\u7528\u6027\u518d\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u5c42\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1)\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u542bNA\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c(2)\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c(3)\u9002\u7528\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u5728DeepFashion-MultiModal\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u6d4b9\u4e2aVLMs\u53caFashion-CLIP+\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLMs\u8fbe64.0% macro-F1\uff08\u662fFashion-CLIP+LR\u7684\u4e09\u500d\uff09\uff1b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7bF1\u8fbe70.8%\uff0c\u4f46\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4bNA-F1\u4ec534.1%\uff1b\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-5 Mini\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u65d7\u8230\u6a21\u578b90%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e09\u5c42\u6b21\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b or \u5206\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u5c1a\u96f6\u552e\u573a\u666f\u4e2dVLMs\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u4f9d\u636e\uff1b\u63d0\u5347\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5173\u952e\u7a81\u7834\u53e3\u3002"}}

A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u6307\u5bfc\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u7597AI\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5177\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u53cd\u6620\u4e34\u5e8a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u4e24\u9879\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u91c7\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5982\u8d85\u53c2\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u65e9\u505c\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u6807\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u80fd\u4ea7\u51fa\u66f4\u8d34\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u533b\u7597AI\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

We propose a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint derived from a rapid, practice-oriented synthesis of governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance requirements.

Simulation and synthetic data generation offer a scalable alternative, but their usefulness is limited by the visual domain gap between simulation and reality. In this work, we present Point Bridge, a framework that leverages unified, domain-agnostic point-based representations to unlock synthetic datasets for zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, without explicit visual or object-level alignment. Point Bridge combines automated point-based representation extraction via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), transformer-based policy learning, and efficient inference-time pipelines to train capable real-world manipulation agents using only synthetic data. With additional co-training on small sets of real demonstrations, Point Bridge further improves performance, substantially outperforming prior vision-based sim-and-real co-training methods. It achieves up to 44% gains in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and up to 66% with limited real data across both single-task and multitask settings.

We evaluate eight mainstream MDLMs (up to 100B parameters) on 58 benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and programming. The results show that MDLMs still lag behind comparably sized autoregressive models, mainly because parallel probabilistic modeling weakens inter-token dependencies. Meanwhile, MDLMs exhibit adaptive decoding behavior: their parallelism and generation order vary significantly with the task domain, the stage of reasoning, and whether the output is correct. On tasks that require \"backward information\" (e.g., Sudoku), MDLMs adopt a solution order that tends to fill easier Sudoku blanks first, highlighting their advantages.

Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use.

Although neural operators significantly advanced PDE solving in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, their underlying assumption of fully-observed spatial inputs severely restricts applicability in real-world applications. We introduce the first systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observation. We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator~(\\ours) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. Additionally, we develop POBench-PDE, a dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for evaluating neural operators under partial observation conditions across three PDE-governed tasks. \\ours achieves state-of-the-art performance with 18--69$\\%$ relative L2 error reduction across all benchmarks under patch-wise missingness with less than 50$\\%$ missing rate, including real-world climate prediction.

Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).\n  Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises (\"Sycophancy\").\n  This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u662f\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1LLM\u5224\u522b\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u2018\u60ca\u5947\u5ea6\u2019\uff09\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u7b49\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5b9e\u4f53\u805a\u7126\u91c7\u7eb3\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u8bc1\u4f2a\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728HaluBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u4f7fAUROC\u8fbe0.8669\uff08\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53474.95%\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528200\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff08\u6bd4Lynx\u5c1175\u500d\uff09\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb1000\u500d\uff085ms vs 5s\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570<1M\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u2018\u5408\u7406\u5316\u2019\u4fe1\u53f7\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u63ed\u793aLLM\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u8c04\u5a9a\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u2019\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d4c\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5927LLM\u5224\u522b\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model.

Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent). This work is an exploratory study intended to surface challenges and limits of emote-aware toxicity detection on Twitch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faToxiTwitch\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u5d4c\u5165\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5728Twitch\u5e73\u53f0\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523080%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eBERT\u3002", "motivation": "Twitch\u7b49\u76f4\u64ad\u5e73\u53f0\u804a\u5929\u73af\u5883\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u3001\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e14\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u5ba1\u6838\u5458\uff1b\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaToxiTwitch\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5229\u7528DeepSeek-R1-Distill\u548cLlama-3-8B-Instruct\u7b49LLM\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u81f3Random Forest\u548cSVM\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u5f00\u5c55\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "ToxiTwitch\u5728\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u8fbe80%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u8f83BERT\u63d0\u534713%\uff09\uff0cF1-score\u4e3a76%\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f15\u5165\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6bd2\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728Twitch\u4e0a\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff1bToxiTwitch\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

Yet agent testing remains nascent and is still a developing science. As AI agents begin to be deployed globally, it is important that they handle different languages and cultures accurately and securely.\n  To address this, participants from The International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European Commission, France, Kenya, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have come together to align approaches to agentic evaluations.\n  This is the third exercise, building on insights from two earlier joint testing exercises conducted by the Network in November 2024 and February 2025. The objective is to further refine best practices for testing advanced AI systems.\n  The exercise was split into two strands: (1) common risks, including leakage of sensitive information and fraud, led by Singapore AISI; and (2) cybersecurity, led by UK AISI.

However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity.

Existing models often struggle to effectively fuse information from multiple sources and adapt to the heterogeneous nature of pathological tissues. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for adapting foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging, featuring two key technical innovations: sub-region-aware modality attention and adaptive prompt engineering. The attention mechanism enables the model to learn the optimal combination of modalities for each tumor sub-region, while the adaptive prompting strategy leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models to refine segmentation accuracy.

We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility. More broadly, our results suggest that deep learning-based decision tools are more effective and robust when guided by human knowledge, highlighting the value of integrating advanced analytics with inventory theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u672a\u77e5\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6613\u8150\u5e93\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u8ba2\u8d27\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u9645\u6210\u672c\u4f1a\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08\u5982PIL\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6613\u8150\u54c1\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u3001\u672a\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u63d0\u524d\u671f\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u9645\u6210\u672c\u4f1a\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7eaf\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\uff08E2E-BB\uff09\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff08E2E-PIL\uff09\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5d4c\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5e93\u5b58\u6c34\u5e73\uff08PIL\uff09\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u9f50\u6b21\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff08ODA\uff09 boosting \u6280\u672f\u5f97\u5230\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565 E2E-BPIL\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6392\u5e8f\u4e3a\uff1aE2E-BB < E2E-PIL < E2E-BPIL\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u5e93\u5b58\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u878d\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u2018\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u2019\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To leverage their spatiotemporal priors, robotics works have adapted video models for policy learning but introduce complexity by requiring multiple stages of post-training and new architectural components for action generation. In this work, we introduce Cosmos Policy, a simple approach for adapting a large pretrained video model (Cosmos-Predict2) into an effective robot policy through a single stage of post-training on the robot demonstration data collected on the target platform, with no architectural modifications. Cosmos Policy learns to directly generate robot actions encoded as latent frames within the video model's latent diffusion process, harnessing the model's pretrained priors and core learning algorithm to capture complex action distributions. Additionally, Cosmos Policy generates future state images and values (expected cumulative rewards), which are similarly encoded as latent frames, enabling test-time planning of action trajectories with higher likelihood of success. In our evaluations, Cosmos Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO and RoboCasa simulation benchmarks (98.5% and 67.1% average success rates, respectively) and the highest average score in challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, outperforming strong diffusion policies trained from scratch, video model-based policies, and state-of-the-art vision-language-action models fine-tuned on the same robot demonstrations. Furthermore, given policy rollout data, Cosmos Policy can learn from experience to refine its world model and value function and leverage model-based planning to achieve even higher success rates in challenging tasks.

However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faARDIS\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u8f7d\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u76f2\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u6c42\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u8f7d\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9700\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u539f\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9891\u57df\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5206\u79bb\u5168\u5c40\u57fa\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u6f5c\u7801\uff09\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u5668\uff08\u7528\u6f5c\u7801\u8c03\u5236\u8fde\u7eed\u9690\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u9891\u6b8b\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9690\u5f0f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u7a20\u5bc6\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f2\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "ARDIS\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6062\u590d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ARDIS\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u9690\u5199\u8303\u5f0f\u4ece\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u8f6c\u5411\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u76f2\u6062\u590d\u9690\u5199\u3002"}}

Starting from the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) shrinkage estimator, we decompose the LW covariance matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and apply a lightweight transformer-based neural network to learn a nonlinear eigenvalue shrinkage function. Trained with portfolio risk as the loss function, the resulting precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) estimator directly targets portfolio risk minimization. By conditioning on the sample-to-dimension ratio, the approach remains scalable across different sample sizes and asset universes.

Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary.

Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap. Experiments with widely-used LLMs demonstrate that Persona Switch consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to 5.13% accuracy improvement.

We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics.

Despite its empirical success, it remains unclear whether RLVR elicits novel capabilities or merely sharpens the distribution over existing knowledge. We study this by formalizing over-sharpening, a phenomenon where the policy collapses onto limited modes, suppressing valid alternatives. At a high level, we discover finite-batch updates intrinsically bias learning toward sampled modes, triggering a collapse that propagates globally via semantic coupling. To mitigate this, we propose inverse-success advantage calibration to prioritize difficult queries and distribution-level calibration to diversify sampling via a memory network.

To examine how current model safeguards hold up in such settings, participants from the International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Kenya, South Korea and the UK conducted a joint multilingual evaluation exercise. Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.\n  The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines.

This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

Ellen Grant", "Davood Karimi"], "title": "Atlas-Assisted Segment Anything Model for Fetal Brain MRI (FeTal-SAM)", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper presents FeTal-SAM, a novel adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored for fetal brain MRI segmentation. Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages.

Yet, these systems struggle to scale in realistic enterprise settings with large, complex schemas, diverse SQL dialects, and expensive multi-step reasoning. Emerging agentic approaches show potential for adaptive reasoning but often suffer from inefficiency and instability-repeating interactions with databases, producing inconsistent outputs, and occasionally failing to generate valid answers. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent Semantic Memory (AgentSM), an agentic framework for Text-to-SQL that builds and leverages interpretable semantic memory. Instead of relying on raw scratchpads or vector retrieval, AgentSM captures prior execution traces-or synthesizes curated ones-as structured programs that directly guide future reasoning. This design enables systematic reuse of reasoning paths, which allows agents to scale to larger schemas, more complex questions, and longer trajectories efficiently and reliably. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, AgentSM achieves higher efficiency by reducing average token usage and trajectory length by 25% and 35%, respectively, on the Spider 2.0 benchmark.

However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module.

This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFission-GRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ea0\u6b63\u6027\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u9519\u8bef\u540e\u6613\u9677\u5165\u65e0\u6548\u91cd\u8bd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u6807\u51c6RL\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a00\u758f\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u800c\u5408\u6210\u7ea0\u9519\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFission-GRPO\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Error Simulator\u4e3a\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u8bca\u65ad\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u2018\u88c2\u53d8\u2019\u4e3a\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u7684on-policy\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728BFCL v4 Multi-Turn\u4e0a\uff0cQwen3-8B\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6062\u590d\u7387\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u53475.7%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece42.75%\u63d0\u5347\u81f346.75%\uff08+4%\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aGRPO\u53ca\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9519\u8bef\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aon-policy\u7ea0\u6b63\u76d1\u7763\u662f\u63d0\u5347LLM\u9c81\u68d2\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff0cFission-GRPO\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027AI\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Genetic Programming (GP) has been widely applied to automatically evolve scheduling rules for DFJSS. However, existing studies typically train and test GP-evolved rules on DFJSS instances of the same type, which differ only by random seeds rather than by structural characteristics, leaving their cross-type generalisation ability largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalisation ability of GP-evolved scheduling rules under diverse DFJSS conditions. A series of experiments are conducted across multiple dimensions, including problem scale (i.e., the number of machines and jobs), key job shop parameters (e.g., utilisation level), and data distributions, to analyse how these factors influence GP performance on unseen instance types. The results show that good generalisation occurs when the training instances contain more jobs than the test instances while keeping the number of machines fixed, and when both training and test instances have similar scales or job shop parameters. Further analysis reveals that the number and distribution of decision points in DFJSS instances play a crucial role in explaining these performance differences. Similar decision point distributions lead to better generalisation, whereas significant discrepancies result in a marked degradation of performance. Overall, this study provides new insights into the generalisation ability of GP in DFJSS and highlights the necessity of evolving more generalisable GP rules capable of handling heterogeneous DFJSS instances effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9057\u4f20\u89c4\u5212\uff08GP\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u67d4\u6027\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08DFJSS\uff09\u4e2d\u6f14\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8de8\u7c7b\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5728\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6570\u3001\u673a\u5668\u6570\u3001\u5229\u7528\u7387\u53ca\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GP\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u5728\u540c\u6784\uff08\u4ec5\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0d\u540c\uff09\u7684DFJSS\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5176\u8de8\u7ed3\u6784\u7c7b\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30GP\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u4e0d\u540cDFJSS\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "GP\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6570\u591a\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e14\u673a\u5668\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u8f83\u597d\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u8fd1\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u662f\u89e3\u91ca\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "GP\u5728DFJSS\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684GP\u6f14\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784DFJSS\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns. We conclude that representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment and an evaluation focused on marginals can mask structural failures, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u8fb9\u7f18\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd8\u8003\u5bdf\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u62df\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u5747\u672a\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8fb9\u7f18\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7fa4\u548c\u6587\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\uff08persona prompting\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5fae\u8c03\uff08demographic fine-tuning\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u4e16\u754c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u8c03\u67e5\uff08WVS\uff09\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u54cd\u5e94\u4e3a\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u590d\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u662f\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4e14\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e50\u89c2\u5224\u65ad\u3002"}}

However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLL-GaussianImage\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u57282D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff082DGS\uff09\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u57df\u5185\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4f4e\u5149\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u538b-\u589e\u5f3a-\u518d\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u5149\u589e\u5f3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5904\u74062DGS\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u9700\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u89e3\u538b-\u589e\u5f3a-\u518d\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u4e8c\u6b21\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684MoE\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u534f\u540c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u57282DGS\u7a00\u758f\u5c5e\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u538b\u7f29\u5373\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u5373\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u57df\u5904\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LL-GaussianImage\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u5728\u663e\u5f0f3D\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u538b\u7f29\u57df\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u4f4e\u5149\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

However, LLMs often lack a nuanced understanding of human cognition and behavior, limiting their effectiveness in social simulation and personalized applications. We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns. We then formulate diverse learning tasks and perform supervised fine-tuning to empower the model to predict a wide range of individualized human behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HumanLLM achieves superior performance in predicting user actions and inner thoughts, more accurately mimics user writing styles and preferences, and generates more authentic user profiles compared to base models. Furthermore, HumanLLM shows significant gains on out-of-domain social intelligence benchmarks, indicating enhanced generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHumanLLM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b550\u4e07\u7528\u6237\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684Cognitive Genome\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u53ca\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2a\u4f53\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Cognitive Genome Dataset\uff09\uff0c\u7ecf\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6e05\u6d17\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u53d6550\u4e07\u7528\u6237\u65e5\u5fd7\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "HumanLLM\u5728\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5185\u5fc3\u60f3\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5199\u4f5c\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u4eff\u3001\u7528\u6237\u6863\u6848\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u793e\u4f1a\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HumanLLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u4e2a\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u5f84\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u6d1e\u5bdf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance. On the AC3 and AC4 datasets under low-annotation regimes, our method improves the ARAND metric by 32.1% and 30.7%, respectively, when combined with two different post-processing methods.

While diverse KD methods, including response based, feature based, and relation based approaches, capture different aspects of teacher knowledge, integrating multiple methods or knowledge sources is promising but often hampered by complex implementation, inflexible combinations, and catastrophic forgetting, which limits practical effectiveness.\n  This work proposes SMSKD (Sequential Multi Stage Knowledge Distillation), a flexible framework that sequentially integrates heterogeneous KD methods. At each stage, the student is trained with a specific distillation method, while a frozen reference model from the previous stage anchors learned knowledge to mitigate forgetting. In addition, we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism based on the teacher true class probability (TCP) that dynamically adjusts the reference loss per sample to balance knowledge retention and integration.\n  By design, SMSKD supports arbitrary method combinations and stage counts with negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments show that SMSKD consistently improves student accuracy across diverse teacher student architectures and method combinations, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies confirm that stage wise distillation and reference model supervision are primary contributors to performance gains, with TCP based adaptive weighting providing complementary benefits.

Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\\% improvement in multiple sub-domains.

Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks.

This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound.

The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u589e\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\uff08TabII\uff09\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f7f\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u5165\u65b0\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3TabAdapter\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5217\u7684\u8868\u683c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u683c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21TabII\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3TabAdapter\uff08\u63d0\u4f9b\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u63d0\u70bc\u589e\u91cf\u5217\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTabII\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u589e\u91cf\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\uff08state-of-the-art\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "TabII\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u53d8\u8868\u683c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score.

In real deployment, edits arrive as long streams, and existing editors often face a plasticity-stability dilemma: locate-then-edit \"hard writes\" can accumulate interference over time, while null-space-style \"hard preservation\" preserves only what is explicitly constrained, so past edits can be overwritten and unconstrained behaviors may deviate, degrading general capabilities in the many-edits regime. We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRLSEdit\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u951a\u5b9a\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u671f\u6d41\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u53ef\u5851\u6027-\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u786c\u5199\u5165\u6613\u7d2f\u79ef\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u786c\u4fdd\u62a4\u5219\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5386\u53f2\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u672a\u7ea6\u675f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "RLSEdit\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7d2f\u8ba1\u952e\u503c\u62df\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u5206\u522b\u7ea6\u675f\u504f\u79bb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6307\u5b9a\u951a\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u5229\u7528Woodbury\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9012\u5f52\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u7f16\u8f91\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u957f\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRLSEdit\u7a33\u5b9a\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8fbe10K\u6b21\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u65e9\u671f\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u7559\u3001GLUE\u53ca\u63a8\u7406/\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "RLSEdit\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u9012\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u5851\u6027-\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u957f\u5468\u671f\u7684LLM\u5728\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prior work leverages demonstrations and human feedback to improve learning efficiency and robustness. However, offline-to-online methods need large datasets and can be unstable, while VLA-assisted RL relies on large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning. As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \\textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSigEnt-SAC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6761\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u5373\u53ef\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Sigmoid\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u71b5\u9879\u7f13\u89e3Q\u51fd\u6570\u632f\u8361\u4e0eOOD\u52a8\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3001VLA\u8f85\u52a9RL\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u6216\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSigEnt-SAC\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26Sigmoid\u7ea6\u675f\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u7684off-policy actor-critic\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u71b5\u9879\u9632\u6b62\u8d1f\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u6291\u5236Q\u51fd\u6570\u632f\u8361\uff1b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6761\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3Q\u51fd\u6570\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u8fbe\u5230100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5373\u80fd\u5b66\u4f1a\u6210\u529f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "SigEnt-SAC\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u5316RL\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported. In contrast, features such as grammatical accuracy and emotional tone frequently led to misclassification.

We enable ecologists to experiment with ML models independently, thus they can move beyond off-the-shelf models and generate insights tailored to local datasets and specific classification tasks and target variables. Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification. These results demonstrate that reliable demographic classification is feasible even with limited data to answer narrow, well-defined ecological problems.

While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\u8303\u56f4\uff08ZEH\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86ZEH\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\u6d8c\u73b0\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u6784\u6210\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u523b\u753b\u6a21\u578b\u2018\u65e0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u2019\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\u8303\u56f4\uff08ZEH\uff09\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u8bef\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u6700\u5927\u8f93\u5165\u89c4\u6a21\uff1b\u5728GPT-5.2\u548cQwen2.5\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30ZEH\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebfsoftmax\u6280\u672f\u52a0\u901fZEH\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0GPT-5.2\u5728\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5947\u5076\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u62ec\u53f7\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5373\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\uff1bZEH\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u53ef\u53cd\u6620\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u5341\u500d\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "ZEH\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63ed\u793aLLM\u57fa\u7840\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8b66\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u6d8c\u73b0\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Yet their overconfidence in failure remains a fundamental barrier to deployment in high-stakes settings. Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014'\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6'\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86'\u6574\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u6821\u51c6\uff08HTC\uff09'\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b8c\u6574\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u5355\u8f6e\u8f93\u51fa\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7b49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHolistic Trajectory Calibration\uff08HTC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5b8f\u89c2\u52a8\u6001\u5230\u5fae\u89c2\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6574\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6821\u51c6\u5668\uff08GAC\uff09\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "HTC\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982ECE\uff09\u548c\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728\u8de8\u57dfGAIA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f4eECE\uff1b\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u4ee5\u2018\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u2019\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

For that, 200-500 documents are typically annotated. The number is constrained by time and costs and lacks justification of the sample size requirements and their relationship to text vocabulary properties.\n  Methods: Using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset containing hospital discharge notes with ICD-9 diagnoses as labels, we employed pre-trained BERT embeddings followed by Random Forest classifiers to identify 10 randomly selected diagnoses, varying training corpus sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents, and analyzed vocabulary properties by identifying strong and noisy predictive words through Lasso logistic regression on bag-of-words embeddings.\n  Results: Learning curves varied significantly across the 10 classification tasks despite identical preprocessing and algorithms, with 600 documents sufficient to achieve 95% of the performance attainable with 10,000 documents for all tasks. Vocabulary analysis revealed that more strong predictors and fewer noisy predictors were associated with steeper learning curves, where every 100 additional noisy words decreased accuracy by approximately 0.02 while 100 additional strong predictors increased maximum accuracy by approximately 0.04.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0600\u4efd\u6587\u6863\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4f7f\u752810,000\u4efd\u6587\u6863\u65f695%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bcd\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8bcd\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u89c4\u6807\u6ce8200\u2013500\u4efd\u6587\u6863\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-III\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528BERT\u5d4c\u5165+\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u572810\u4e2aICD-9\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5100\u201310,000\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7528Lasso\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u8bcd\u888b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f3a/\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u8bcd\u4ee5\u5173\u8054\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c600\u4efd\u6587\u6863\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe10,000\u4efd\u65f695%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6bcf\u589e\u52a0100\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u8bcd\u4f7f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u964d\u7ea60.02\uff0c\u6bcf\u589e\u52a0100\u4e2a\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bcd\u4f7f\u6700\u5927\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5347\u7ea60.04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5f3a/\u566a\u58f0\u8bcd\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u636e\u6b64\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training.

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only.

Dennis", "Marc Cheong"], "title": "Creativity in the Age of AI: Rethinking the Role of Intentional Agency", "comment": "27 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Many theorists of creativity maintain that intentional agency is a necessary condition of creativity. We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function.

The proposed system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect real-time data from DHT22 (temperature/humidity), HC-SR04 (water level), and soil moisture sensors, with visual feedback through an OLED display and auditory alerts via a buzzer. All sensor data is wirelessly transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for remote monitoring, historical analysis, and automated alert generation. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels (with 92\\% accuracy), providing real-time environmental monitoring, and reducing water consumption by approximately 40\\% compared to conventional irrigation methods.

Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization.

This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE PerCom 2026", "summary": "With the growing demand for device-free and privacy-preserving sensing solutions, Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a promising approach for human pose estimation (HPE). However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x.

Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification.

Our paper introduces an image-based approach that transforms magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals into time-frequency representations compatible with pretrained vision models. MEG data from 21 participants performing imagined speech tasks were projected into three spatial scalogram mixtures via a learnable sensor-space convolution, producing compact image-like inputs for ImageNet-pretrained vision architectures. These models outperformed classical and non-pretrained models, achieving up to 90.4% balanced accuracy for imagery vs. silence, 81.0% vs. silent reading, and 60.6% for vowel decoding. Cross-subject evaluation confirmed that pretrained models capture shared neural representations, and temporal analyses localized discriminative information to imagery-locked intervals.

Class-imbalance-aware sampling and cosine annealing with warm restarts are adopted to mimic rhythmic regulation and attention allocation mechanisms observed in biological neural systems.Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight brain-inspired model achieves strong and stable performance in binary coronary angiography classification, yielding competitive accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics while maintaining high computational efficiency.Conclusion: This study validates the effectiveness of brain-inspired learning mechanisms in lightweight medical image analysis and provides a biologically plausible and deployable solution for intelligent clinical decision support under limited computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53d7\u5927\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c03\u5236\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u53d8\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53c2\u6570\u9002\u914d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u878d\u5408Focal Loss\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c03\u5236\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u5e26\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\u548cAUC\u6307\u6807\u5747\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique \"failure signature\", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations.

We make two contributions: (1)Encoder Model Pre-trained from Scratch: ModernBERT-based bidirectional encoders pre-trained on a Turkish-dominant corpus of 112.7 billion tokens. We implement a checkpoint selection strategy that evaluates downstream retrieval performance throughout training, revealing that optimal checkpoints achieve best retrieval scores before pre-training loss reaches its minimum. Our encoder models achieve top-3 rankings on the Turkish retrieval leaderboard, with smaller models (155M parameters) achieving comparable performance to larger reference models (307M-567M parameters). Our approach achieves 92.36% production efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models (embeddinggemma-300m: 100.00%, BAAI/bge-m3: 99.54%, newmindai/bge-m3-stsb: 94.38%), ranking fourth overall despite requiring less computational resources.

This reveals limited understanding of components governing safety. Existing methods rely on local, greedy attribution that assumes independent component contributions. However, they overlook the cooperative interactions between different components in LLMs, such as attention heads, which jointly contribute to safety mechanisms. We propose \\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{O}ptimization for \\textbf{S}afety \\textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously. We employ two complementary activation repatching strategies: Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation. These strategies identify two spatially distinct sets of safety vectors with consistently low overlap, termed Malicious Injection Vectors and Safety Suppression Vectors, demonstrating that aligned LLMs maintain separate functional pathways for safety purposes. Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching.

However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%).

To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage.

However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation.

The reliance on \"Passive Observation\" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faICON\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u5148\u9a8c\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u4eba\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u56e0\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u4eba\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdf\u8303\u5f0f\u5f15\u53d1\u591a\u91cd\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faICON\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u89c4\u5219\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u79fb\u690d\u6d88\u9664\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\uff1b3\uff09\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u7f13\u89e3\u5c40\u90e8\u663e\u8457\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff1b4\uff09\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u62d3\u6251\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5148\u9a8c\u7ea6\u675f\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "ICON\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u906e\u6321\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ICON\u63a8\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u4eba\u641c\u7d22\u4ece\u62df\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u5171\u73b0\u8f6c\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u679c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u76d1\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We train language-specific LoRA adapters for English, Spanish, and Turkish and combined them via uniform linear merging or learned fusion MLP with dynamic gating. Experimental results show that the fusion MLP recovers around 75\\% of the accuracy gains from joint multilingual fine-tuning while requiring only a smaller subset of the data, outperforming linear merging across all three languages.

By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5217\u817a\u591a\u53c2\u6570MRI\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6295\u5165\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cdVFMs\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7684MAE\u6a21\u578b\uff08ProFound\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08ProViCNet\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u524d\u5217\u817a\u591a\u53c2\u6570MRI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff08MMD\uff09\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u6563\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff08\u4ee5MMD\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d8a\u663e\u8457\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u6536\u655b\u8d8a\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5206\u6790\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u5176\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u63d0\u5347VFMs\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

This limitation does not arise from insufficient model capacity, but from treating post-training inference systems as monolithic operators while ignoring internal structures formed during learning. We show that gradient update events in large models are highly localized and selective, leaving many parameter dependencies statistically indistinguishable from their initialization distribution after training. As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable. Based on this observation, we introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure that removes unsupported dependencies and reveals stable, independent substructures.

Languages such as Kashmiri, with approximately 7 million speakers and a complex Perso-Arabic script featuring unique diacritical marks, currently lack support in major OCR systems including Tesseract, TrOCR, and PaddleOCR. Manual dataset creation for such languages is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, often requiring word by word transcription of printed or handwritten text.\n  We present SynthOCR-Gen, an open-source synthetic OCR dataset generator specifically designed for low-resource languages. Our tool addresses the fundamental bottleneck in OCR development by transforming digital Unicode text corpora into ready-to-use training datasets. The system implements a comprehensive pipeline encompassing text segmentation (character, word, n-gram, sentence, and line levels), Unicode normalization with script purity enforcement, multi-font rendering with configurable distribution, and 25+ data augmentation techniques simulating real-world document degradations including rotation, blur, noise, and scanner artifacts.\n  We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a 600,000-sample word-segmented Kashmiri OCR dataset, which we release publicly on HuggingFace. This work provides a practical pathway for bringing low-resource languages into the era of vision-language AI models, and the tool is openly available for researchers and practitioners working with underserved writing systems worldwide.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSynthOCR-Gen\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5408\u6210OCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Unicode\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u6599\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u514b\u4ec0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u4e3a\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u4e8660\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce2\u65af-\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u514b\u4ec0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8OCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3b\u6d41OCR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1SynthOCR-Gen\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6bb5\uff08\u5b57\u7b26/\u8bcd/n\u5143/\u53e5/\u884c\uff09\u3001Unicode\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u4e0e\u6587\u5b57\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4fdd\u969c\u3001\u591a\u5b57\u4f53\u6e32\u67d3\uff08\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca25+\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u6587\u6863\u9000\u5316\uff08\u5982\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u626b\u63cf\u4f2a\u5f71\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u542b60\u4e07\u6837\u672c\u7684\u514b\u4ec0\u7c73\u5c14\u8bed\u8bcd\u7ea7OCR\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08HuggingFace\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00OCR\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SynthOCR-Gen\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00OCR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u878d\u5165\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00AI\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6001\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u7403\u6b20\u670d\u52a1\u6587\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Pre-trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images, the model learns to predict latent representations of masked image regions.

Despite their significance in identifying records belonging to the training dataset, several concerns remain unexplored, particularly with regard to tabular data. In this paper, first, we provide an extensive review and analysis of MIAs considering two main learning paradigms: centralized and federated learning. We extend and refine the taxonomy for both. Second, we demonstrate the efficacy of MIAs in tabular data using several attack strategies, also including defenses. Furthermore, in a federated learning scenario, we consider the threat posed by an outsider adversary, which is often neglected. Third, we demonstrate the high vulnerability of single-outs (records with a unique signature) to MIAs. Lastly, we explore how MIAs transfer across model architectures. Our results point towards a general poor performance of these attacks in tabular data which contrasts with previous state-of-the-art. Notably, even attacks with limited attack performance can still successfully expose a large portion of single-outs.

It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT).

Updating one or more supported languages with additional data or adding support for a new language involves retraining the model, which can be computationally inefficient and creates a severe maintenance bottleneck. Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model.

However, extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to multi-spectral scenarios remains challenging. Current approaches often struggle to fully leverage the complementary information of multi-modal data, typically relying on mechanisms that either tend to neglect cross-modal correlations or leverage shared representations that fail to adaptively handle the complex structural correlations and physical discrepancies between spectrums. To address these limitations, we propose ThermoSplat, a novel framework that enables deep spectral-aware reconstruction through active feature modulation and adaptive geometry decoupling. First, we introduce a Cross-Modal FiLM Modulation mechanism that dynamically conditions shared latent features on thermal structural priors, effectively guiding visible texture synthesis with reliable cross-modal geometric cues. Second, to accommodate modality-specific geometric inconsistencies, we propose a Modality-Adaptive Geometric Decoupling scheme that learns independent opacity offsets and executes an independent rasterization pass for the thermal branch. Additionally, a hybrid rendering pipeline is employed to integrate explicit Spherical Harmonics with implicit neural decoding, ensuring both semantic consistency and high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on the RGBT-Scenes dataset demonstrate that ThermoSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across both visible and thermal spectrums.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ThermoSplat\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001FiLM\u8c03\u5236\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0RGB\u4e0e\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u4e09\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u9635\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u9635\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408RGB\u4e0e\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u8c31\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u8054\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faThermoSplat\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09Cross-Modal FiLM Modulation\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\uff1b2\uff09Modality-Adaptive Geometric Decoupling\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u70ed\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60\u72ec\u7acb\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u504f\u79fb\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u5149\u6805\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u7403\u8c10\u51fd\u6570\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6e32\u67d3\u7ba1\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5728RGBT-Scenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cThermoSplat\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4e0e\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u8c31\u6bb5\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "ThermoSplat\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u5149\u8c313DGS\u4e2d\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model.

This evolution is evident in the distinction between the classical and modern Arabic eras. Although historians and linguists have partitioned Arabic literature into multiple eras, relatively little research has explored the automatic classification of Arabic texts by time period, particularly beyond the domain of poetry. This paper addresses this gap by employing neural networks and deep learning techniques to automatically classify Arabic texts into distinct eras and periods. The proposed models are evaluated using two datasets derived from two publicly available corpora, covering texts from the pre-Islamic to the modern era. The study examines class setups ranging from binary to 15-class classification and considers both predefined historical eras and custom periodizations. Results range from F1-scores of 0.83 and 0.79 on the binary-era classification task using the OpenITI and APCD datasets, respectively, to 0.20 on the 15-era classification task using OpenITI and 0.18 on the 12-era classification task using APCD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u6587\u672c\u6309\u5386\u53f2\u65f6\u671f\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u6587\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u65f6\u671f\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u8bd7\u6b4c\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff08OpenITI \u548c APCD\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u4ece\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6700\u9ad815\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u65f6\u671f\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1F1\u5f97\u5206\u8fbe0.83\uff08OpenITI\uff09\u548c0.79\uff08APCD\uff09\uff1b\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u660e\u663e\uff0c15\u7c7b\u548c12\u7c7b\u5206\u522b\u4ec5\u8fbe0.20\u548c0.18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u671f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e0e\u65f6\u671f\u5212\u5206\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\\texttt{gate\\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \\texttt{gate\\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \\texttt{gate\\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u6295\u5f71\u5c42\uff08gate_proj\uff09\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e2d\u60c5\u7eea\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u60c5\u7eea\u76d1\u7763\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u5355\u6a21\u5757\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9002\u914d\u548c\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1gate_proj\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u9002\u914d\u4e3b\u8981\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5728feed-forward gating projection\uff08gate_proj\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975eattention\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\u4ec5\u8c03\u4f18\u7ea624.5%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4AffectGPT\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u517696.6%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u60c5\u611f\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7531\u524d\u9988\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4ecb\u5bfc\uff0cgate_proj\u662f\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\u4f4d\u70b9\u3002"}}

However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6574\u5408\u533b\u9662\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u533b\u7597\u8bbf\u95ee\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SHAP\u548cPDP\u5206\u6790\u5404\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Deep Gravity\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u7fa4\u5bf9\u533b\u9662\u8bc4\u7ea7\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cSES\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u533b\u7597\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u533b\u9662\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u8bbf\u95ee\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u878d\u5408SafeGraph\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e0eGoogle Maps\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e94\u79cd\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08Naive Regression\u3001Gradient Boosting\u3001MLP\u3001Deep Gravity\u3001HGNN\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528SHAP\u548cPDP\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u8054\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "Deep Gravity\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u533b\u9662\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001ICU\u5360\u7528\u7387\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4eba\u6c14\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u5e94\u968f\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\uff1a\u77ed\u8ddd\u91cd\u4fbf\u5229\uff0c\u957f\u8ddd\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u767d\u4eba\u805a\u5c45\u533a\u5bf9\u77ed\u8ddd\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e9a\u88d4\u53ca\u9ad8\u6559\u80b2\u7fa4\u4f53\u66f4\u770b\u91cd\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u88d4\u3001\u9ed1\u4eba\u3001\u672a\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u53ca\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u53e3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9ad8\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8bbf\u95ee\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u7597\u8bbf\u95ee\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u591a\u91cd\u56e0\u7d20\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4eba\u7fa4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff1b\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u5730\u57df\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present.

This task requires a strict latency-accuracy trade-off, with motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency. However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a \"Latency Wall\" exists in the classification stage.

Our main contribution is establishing that laziness is possible without sacrificing hitting performance: we prove that $k$-lazyGD achieves the optimal dynamic regret $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{(P_T+1)T})$ for any laziness slack $k$ up to $\u0398(\\sqrt{T/P_T})$, where $P_T$ is the comparator path length. This result formally connects the allowable laziness to the comparator's shifts, showing that $k$-lazyGD can retain the inherently small movements of lazy methods without compromising tracking ability. We base our analysis on the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework, and derive a matching lower bound.

Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\\%$) and computational efficiency.

The pipeline integrates reliable person detection, whole-body pose estimation, and state-of-the-art 2D hand keypoint prediction on tracked hand crops, followed by a constrained 3D optimization. In addition, we introduce a novel surgical benchmark dataset comprising over 68,000 frames and 3,000 manually annotated 2D hand poses with triangulated 3D ground truth, recorded in a replica operating room under varying levels of scene complexity.\n  Results: Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 31% reduction in 2D mean joint error and a 76% reduction in 3D mean per-joint position error.\n  Conclusion: Our work establishes a strong baseline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgery, providing both a training-free pipeline and a comprehensive annotated dataset to facilitate future research in surgical computer vision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d23D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u624b\u90e8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e862D/3D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883\u5149\u7167\u5f3a\u70c8\u4e14\u4e0d\u5747\u3001\u624b\u90e8\u5e38\u88ab\u5668\u68b0\u6216\u4eba\u5458\u906e\u6321\u3001\u6234\u624b\u5957\u5bfc\u81f4\u5916\u89c2\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u52a0\u4e4b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f3D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5168\u8eab\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u624b\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u540e\u8fdb\u884c2D\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u5f97\u52303D\u59ff\u6001\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u542b68,000\u5e27\u30013,000\u7ec4\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce82D\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u53ca\u4e09\u89d2\u53163D\u771f\u503c\u7684\u624b\u672f\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c2D\u5e73\u5747\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e31%\uff0c3D\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u5173\u8282\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e76%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u76843D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u9996\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5916\u79d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08CFI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6307\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u5f62\u72b6\uff08\u5982\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\uff09\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u672a\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u591f\u7cbe\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08CFI\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d41\uff08normalizing flow\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5206\u5e03\u5230\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53cc\u5c04\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u8d85\u7403\u5f62\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4f7f\u5176\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002", "result": "CFI\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6761\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u7ec4\u7ec4\u5408\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cCFI\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8c03\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u786e\u4fdd\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "CFI\u662f\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6307\u6570\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u73b0\u5b9e\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeepBound\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08MILP\uff09\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aNP-hard\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6548\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeepBound\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u6811\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3\uff09\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u542b\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aNP-hard MILP\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cDeepBound\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u66f4\u5feb\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepBound\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8MILP\u6c42\u89e3\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits.

While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5916\u90e8\u60c5\u611f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u4ef7-\u5524\u9192-\u652f\u914d\uff08VAD\uff09\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u4e00\u9636/\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e26\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u4ee3\u7406\u7ea7\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8c03\u548c\u4eba\u8bbe\u7a81\u53d8\uff1b\u800c\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u8f6e\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u663e\u5f0f\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u957f\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7ea7\u60c5\u611f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Valence-Arousal-Dominance\uff08VAD\uff09\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u77ac\u65f6\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6307\u6570\u5e73\u6ed1\u6216\u52a8\u91cf\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u9636/\u4e8c\u9636\u65f6\u95f4\u6574\u5408\uff1b\u8be5\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u88ab\u6ce8\u5165\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u572825\u8f6e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f62\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u8f68\u8ff9\u6216\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e00\u9636\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u652f\u6301\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5f15\u5165\u60c5\u611f\u60ef\u6027\u4e0e\u6ede\u540e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u52a8\u91cf\u589e\u5927\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u4e8c\u9636\uff09\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u65f6\u5e8f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions.

These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable.

While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvolSplat4D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u524d\u9988\u5f0f\u56db\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u5206\u652f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u8fd1\u573a\u9759\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8fdc\u573a\u666f\u7269\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u91cd\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\uff1a\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u4e0e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u9700\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76843D\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEvolSplat4D\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u7279\u5f81\u4f53\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u5e27\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u9759\u60013D\u9ad8\u65af\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u9884\u6d4b\u5916\u89c2\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c4\u8303\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u76844D\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u652f\u5904\u7406\u8fdc\u573a\u666f\u7269\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u5168\u573a\u666f\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI-360\u3001KITTI\u3001Waymo\u548cPandaSet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEvolSplat4D\u5728\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u524d\u6cbf\u524d\u9988\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "EvolSplat4D\u6210\u529f\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u524d\u9988\u5f0fNVS\u4e2d\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u5bfc\u81f4\u76843D\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5168\u573a\u666f\u76844D\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, MAP estimation is generally intractable, and remains hard even under many common structural constraints and approximation schemes. We introduce $\\mathit{probably\\ approximately\\ correct}$ (PAC) algorithms for MAP inference that provide provably optimal solutions under variable and fixed computational budgets. We characterize tractability conditions for PAC-MAP using information theoretic measures that can be estimated from finite samples.

This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684LLM\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eGlicko2\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u516d\u79cd\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u8ddf\u8fdb\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u2018\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u5b9a\u2019\u4e0e\u2018\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u2019\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u677f\uff08\u80dc\u738781%-100%\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u8303\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u6559\u5b66\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516d\u79cd\u878d\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08Glicko2\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\uff0c\u7531\u516b\u540d\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u4ece\u683c\u5f0f\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u652f\u6301\u6027\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u9002\u5207\u6027\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e24\u4e24\u6bd4\u8f83\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u4e09\u4e2a\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684120\u6761\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u9605\u8bfb\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c pairwise\u80dc\u738781%\u2013100%\uff1b\u8be5\u6a21\u677f\u878d\u5408persona\u4e0econtext manager\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX. It significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHyperAlign\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyperAlign\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u8c03\u5236\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u9891\u7387\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5e26\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728Stable Diffusion\u548cFLUX\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6269\u5c55\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0a\uff0cHyperAlign\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperAlign\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u54cd\u5e94\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u3002"}}

However their evaluations are often conducted in isolation or compared against traditional machine learning methods or trivially adapted vision-based architectures that were not originally proposed for Raman spectroscopy. As a result, direct comparisons between existing deep learning models developed specifically for Raman spectral analysis on shared open-source datasets remain scarce. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents one of the first systematic benchmarks comparing three or more published Raman-specific deep learning classifiers across multiple open-source Raman datasets. We evaluate five representative deep learning architectures under a unified training and hyperparameter tuning protocol across three open-source Raman datasets selected to support standard evaluation, fine-tuning, and explicit distribution-shift testing. We report classification accuracies and macro-averaged F1 scores to provide a fair and reproducible comparison of deep learning models for Raman spectra based classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5b8f\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u8fdb\u884c\u6216\u4ec5\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9Raman\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u62c9\u66fc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027Raman\u4e13\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5b8f\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86Raman\u4e13\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models.

By adjusting logistic regression coefficients, our model can represent split positions at arbitrary locations within each interval. This enables more compact tree representations.

In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_\u03c1$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $\u03a9$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $\u03a9$. Given a probability measure $\u03bc$ on $\u03a9$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $\u03c6\\to \\int_\u03a9K(\\cdot,x)\u03c6(x)d\u03bc(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $\u03a9$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $\u03bc$ supported on $\u03a9$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + \u03b5})$ for any $\u03b5> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $\u03bc$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $\u03b5$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\\left(\u03b5^{-d_\u03c1}\\log\\frac{1}\u03b5\\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments. Our results show that, for kernels such as the Laplace kernel, the effective dimension $d_K$ can be significantly smaller than the Minkowski dimension $d_\u03c1$, even though $d_K = d_\u03c1$ provably holds on regular domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6838\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\uff08KRR\uff09\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cd\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u2014\u2014Minkowski\u7ef4\u5ea6d_\u03c1\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6d_K\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u6838\u79ef\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8870\u51cf\u53ca\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1n-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5373\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u652f\u6491\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d8a\u4f4e\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u8d8a\u597d\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6838\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\uff08\u51e0\u4f55\u578bd_\u03c1\u4e0e\u8c31\u578bd_K\uff09\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1\uff09\u5efa\u7acbKolmogorov n-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0e\u79ef\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u63a8\u5bfc\u53d7\u9650KRR\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1n-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b4\uff09\u5bf9\u5747\u5300\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5206\u5e03\u7ed9\u51fa\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff1b5\uff09\u5728\u5206\u5f62\u96c6\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97d_K\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86n-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u652f\u6491\u4e8e\u03a9\u4e0a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u03bc\u4e0b\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u5f62\uff1b\u5f97\u5230\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8bef\u5dee\u754cO(n^{-(2+d_K)/(2+2d_K)+\u03b5})\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u4f2a\u7684n-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0a\u754c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u8fd1\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(\u03b5^{-d_\u03c1} log(1/\u03b5))\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0Laplace\u6838\u5728\u5206\u5f62\u96c6\u4e0ad_K\u53ef\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8ed_\u03c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6d_K\u6bd4Minkowski\u7ef4\u5ea6d_\u03c1\u66f4\u80fd\u523b\u753b\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u5982\u5206\u5f62\uff09\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, this task is particularly challenging: H\\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis. Experiments on the IHC4BC and MIST datasets demonstrate that PAINT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural fidelity and clinical downstream tasks, validating the potential of structure-guided autoregressive modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPAINT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u8d77\u59cb\u56fe\uff083S-Map\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eceH&E\u56fe\u50cf\u5230IHC\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfIHC\u67d3\u8272\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u89c2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u865a\u62dfIHC\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4ee5\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u5e03\u5c40\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6309\u56e0\u679c\u987a\u5e8f\u9010\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5b50\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5f15\u5165Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map)\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u951a\u5b9a\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728IHC4BC\u548cMIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPAINT\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u8fbe\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e2d\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u865a\u62dfIHC\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising pretraining approach that enables effective transfer learning with limited labelled data. However, existing CL frameworks either focus solely on global context or fail to exploit ECG-specific characteristics. Furthermore, these methods rely on hard contrastive targets, which may not adequately capture the continuous nature of feature similarity in ECG signals. In this paper, we propose Beat-SSL, a contrastive learning framework that performs dual-context learning through both rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting with soft targets. We evaluated our pretrained model on two downstream tasks: 1) multilabel classification for global rhythm assessment, and 2) ECG segmentation to assess its capacity to learn representations across both contexts. We conducted an ablation study and compared the best configuration with three other methods, including one ECG foundation model. Despite the foundation model's broader pretraining, Beat-SSL reached 93% of its performance in multilabel classification task and surpassed all other methods in the segmentation task by 4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBeat-SSL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u53cc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8282\u5f8b\u7ea7\u548c\u5fc3\u8df3\u7ea7\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u6ce8ECG\u6570\u636e\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6ECG\u7279\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u8282\u5f8b\u4e0e\u5fc3\u8df3\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u786c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u523b\u753bECG\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBeat-SSL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u5f8b\u7ea7\u548c\u5fc3\u8df3\u7ea7\u53cc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u66ff\u4ee3\u786c\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5fc3\u5f8b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b93%\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728ECG\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd54%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587+\u8f6f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u9002\u914dECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5229\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

It has been accepted by IEEE ISBI", "summary": "Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faProGiDiff\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408ControlNet\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3001\u591a\u63d0\u6848\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u5272\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProGiDiff\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ControlNet\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5b9a\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u6307\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u5668\u5b98\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u5272\uff1b\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982CT\u5230MR\uff09\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728CT\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4e13\u5bb6\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u591a\u63d0\u6848\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u7ecf\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230MR\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3002", "conclusion": "ProGiDiff\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u591a\u7c7b\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erd\u0151s' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis.

To address this vulnerability, we propose the Feature-space Smoothing (FS) and theoretically prove that FS offers certified robustness on the feature representations of MLLMs. Specifically, FS transforms any feature encoder into a smoothed variant that is guaranteed to maintain a certified lower bound on the feature cosine similarity between clean and adversarial representations under $\\ell_2$-bounded attacks. Moreover, we indicate that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) derived from FS can be improved by enlarging the defined Gaussian robustness score on the vanilla encoder. Building upon this, we introduce the Purifier and Smoothness Mapper (PSM), a plug-and-play module that improves the Gaussian robustness score of MLLMs and thus enhances their certified robustness under FS, without requiring any retraining on MLLMs. We demonstrate that the FS with PSM not only provides a strong theoretical robustness guarantee but also exhibits superior empirical performance compared to adversarial training.

Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations.

To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios.

However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks.

First, to achieve efficient and adaptive token sequences for improved Mamba performance, we integrate the clustering mechanism into a spatial Mamba architecture, leading to a cluster-guided spatial Mamba module (CSpaMamba) that reduces the Mamba sequence length and improves Mamba feature learning capability. Second, to improve the learning of both spatial and spectral information, we integrate the CSpaMamba module with a spectral mamba module (SpeMamba), leading to a complete clustering-guided spatial-spectral Mamba framework. Third, to further improve feature learning capability, we introduce an Attention-Driven Token Selection mechanism to optimize Mamba token sequencing. Last, to seamlessly integrate clustering into the Mamba model in a coherent manner, we design a Learnable Clustering Module that learns the cluster memberships in an adaptive manner.

In this work, we explore latent space watermarking and introduce DistSeal, a unified approach for latent watermarking that works across both diffusion and autoregressive models. Our approach works by training post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models. We demonstrate that these latent watermarkers can be effectively distilled either into the generative model itself or into the latent decoder, enabling in-model watermarking. The resulting latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness while offering similar imperceptibility and up to 20x speedup compared to pixel-space baselines.

We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes \"in action\" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed \"temporal 3D diffusion\". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting.

Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space.

We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360\u00b0 generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Representation Autoencoders\uff08RAEs\uff09\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RAE\u76f8\u6bd4VAE\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5747\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76RAE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5426\u4eceImageNet\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3SigLIP-2\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55RAE\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u5408\u6210\u3001\u6587\u5b57\u6e32\u67d3\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30RAE\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u6269\u6563\u5934\u5bbd\u5ea6\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u7801\uff09\uff1b\u57280.5B\u20139.8B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0eFLUX VAE\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "RAE\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eVAE\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2dVAE\u572864\u8f6e\u540e\u707e\u96be\u6027\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u800cRAE\u5728256\u8f6e\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1bRAE\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "RAE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4VAE\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21T2I\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff08CVU\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ZS-CAR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u2018\u7269\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u8bcd\u6377\u5f84\u2019\u800c\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51faRCORE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u987a\u5e8f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ZS-CAR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u52a8\u8bcd-\u7269\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3b\u56e0\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u5171\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5373\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u7269\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u8bcd\u6377\u5f84\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRCORE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u7ec4\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u52a8\u8bcd-\u7269\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u65f6\u5e8f\u987a\u5e8f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Sth-com\u548c\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684EK100-com\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cRCORE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u89c1\u7ec4\u5408\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5171\u73b0\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6b63\u5411\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08compositional gap\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u662fZS-CAR\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u53ea\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u6291\u5236\u6b64\u7c7b\u6377\u5f84\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u8bcd\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
