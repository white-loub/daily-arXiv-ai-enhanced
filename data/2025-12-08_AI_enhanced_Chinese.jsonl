Yet mid-flight reconfiguration presents a critical aerodynamic challenge: tilting propulsors to achieve shape change reduces vertical thrust, undermining stability and control authority. Here, we introduce a passive wake vectoring mechanism that recovers lost thrust during morphing. Integrated into a novel robotic system, Aerially Transforming Morphobot (ATMO), internal deflectors intercept and redirect rotor wake downward, passively steering airflow momentum that would otherwise be wasted. This electronics-free solution achieves up to a 40% recovery of vertical thrust in configurations where no useful thrust would otherwise be produced, substantially extending hover and maneuvering capabilities during transformation. Our findings highlight a new direction for morphing aerial robot design, where passive aerodynamic structures, inspired by thrust vectoring in rockets and aircraft, enable efficient, agile flight without added mechanical complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u7535\u5b50\u5143\u4ef6\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u5c3e\u6d41\u5bfc\u5411\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7a7a\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08ATMO\uff09\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f62\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u56e0\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668\u503e\u659c\u800c\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u63a8\u529b\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u6062\u590d40%\u7684\u63a8\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53d8\u5f62\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u60ac\u505c\u4e0e\u673a\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f62\u65f6\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668\u503e\u659c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5782\u76f4\u63a8\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u63a8\u529b\u8865\u507f\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u88ab\u52a8\u5f0f\u5185\u90e8\u5bfc\u6d41\u7247\uff0c\u62e6\u622a\u5e76\u5411\u4e0b\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u65cb\u7ffc\u5c3e\u6d41\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u91cf\u518d\u5206\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u529b\u56de\u6536\uff1b\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u7a7a\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4ebaATMO\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u539f\u672c\u65e0\u6709\u6548\u5782\u76f4\u63a8\u529b\u7684\u6784\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe40%\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u63a8\u529b\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u957f\u4e86\u53d8\u5f62\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u60ac\u505c\u4e0e\u673a\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u88ab\u52a8\u6c14\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u53d7\u706b\u7bad\u4e0e\u98de\u673a\u63a8\u529b\u77e2\u91cf\u6280\u672f\u542f\u53d1\uff09\u53ef\u6210\u4e3a\u53d8\u5f62\u98de\u884c\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u673a\u68b0\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u654f\u6377\u98de\u884c\u3002"}}

The underlying challenge is that the optimization formulation becomes brittle and numerically unstable with changing scales, especially under potentially nonlinear constraints that impose dynamic restrictions, due to the kernel-based formulation. This paper proposes to address this problem via the development of a scale-agnostic and adaptive ergodic coverage optimization method based on the maximum mean discrepancy metric (MMD). Our approach allows the optimizer to solve for the scale of differential constraints while annealing the hyperparameters to best suit the problem domain and ensure physical consistency. We also derive a variation of the ergodic metric in the log space, providing additional numerical conditioning without loss of performance.

Despite recent advancements, many large-scale robotic policies still remain sensitive to key sources of observational variation such as changes in camera perspective, lighting, and the presence of distractor objects. We posit that the limited generalizability of these models arises from the substantial diversity required to robustly cover these quasistatic axes, coupled with the current scarcity of large-scale robotic datasets that exhibit rich variation across them. In this work, we propose to systematically examine what robots need to generalize across these challenging axes by introducing two key auxiliary tasks, state similarity and invariance to observational perturbations, applied to both demonstration data and static visual data. We then show that via these auxiliary tasks, leveraging both more-expensive robotic demonstration data and less-expensive, visually rich synthetic images generated from non-physics-based simulation (for example, Unreal Engine) can lead to substantial increases in generalization to unseen camera viewpoints, lighting configurations, and distractor conditions. Our results demonstrate that co-training on this diverse data improves performance by 18 percent over existing generative augmentation methods.

While substantial progress has been devoted to human behavior prediction, limited attention has been paid to how humans perceive, interpret, and trust robots' inferences, impeding deployment in safety-critical and socially embedded environments. This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation.

In this setting, each agent's reward depends on its own state-action pair as well as those of its direct neighbors, and each agent's policy is parameterized by its local parameters together with those of its $\u03ba_{p}$-hop neighbors, with $\u03ba_{p}\\geq 1$ denoting the coupled radius. The objective of the agents is to collaboratively optimize their policies to maximize the discounted average cumulative reward. To address the challenge of interdependent policies in collaborative optimization, we introduce a novel concept termed the neighbors' averaged $Q$-function and derive a new expression for the coupled policy gradient. Based on these theoretical foundations, we develop a distributed scalable coupled policy (DSCP) algorithm, where each agent relies only on the state-action pairs of its $\u03ba_{p}$-hop neighbors and the rewards its their $(\u03ba_{p}+1)$-hop neighbors. Specially, in the DSCP algorithm, we employ a geometric 2-horizon sampling method that does not require storing a full $Q$-table to obtain an unbiased estimate of the coupled policy gradient. Moreover, each agent interacts exclusively with its direct neighbors to obtain accurate policy parameters, while maintaining local estimates of other agents' parameters to execute its local policy and collect samples for optimization. These estimates and policy parameters are updated via a push-sum protocol, enabling distributed coordination of policy updates across the network. We prove that the joint policy produced by the proposed algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective function. Finally, the effectiveness of DSCP algorithm is demonstrated through simulations in a robot path planning environment, showing clear improvement over state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08NMARL\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff08DSCP\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90bb\u5c45\u5e73\u5747Q\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f552\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u4e0epush-sum\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u5e73\u7a33\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7f51\u7edc\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u5956\u52b1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8026\u5408\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u90bb\u5c45\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u90bb\u5c45\u5e73\u5747Q\u51fd\u6570\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b0\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1DSCP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4f552\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u4f30\u8ba1\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u03ba\u209a\u8df3\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ca(\u03ba\u209a+1)\u8df3\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u5956\u52b1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7push-sum\u534f\u8bae\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u672c\u5730\u7b56\u7565\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5bf9\u90bb\u5c45\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u5e73\u7a33\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DSCP\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u8026\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e92\u4f9d\u5956\u52b1\u7684NMARL\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, like the visual autoregressive model that unifies text and image processing in a single transformer architecture, generating high-quality interleaved content remains challenging. Moreover, evaluations of these interleaved sequences largely remain underexplored, with existing benchmarks often limited by unimodal metrics that inadequately assess the intricacies of combined image-text outputs. To address these issues, we present RAG-IGBench, a thorough benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the task of Interleaved Generation based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG-IG) in open-domain question answering. RAG-IG integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with retrieval mechanisms, enabling the models to access external image-text information for generating coherent multimodal content. Distinct from previous datasets, RAG-IGBench draws on the latest publicly available content from social platforms and introduces innovative evaluation metrics that measure the quality of text and images, as well as their consistency. Through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs (both open-source and proprietary) on RAG-IGBench, we provide an in-depth analysis examining the capabilities and limitations of these models. Additionally, we validate our evaluation metrics by demonstrating their high correlation with human assessments.

In this study, we developed a chatbot for the University of Limerick's Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering to provide course information to students. A custom dataset of 1,203 question-answer pairs in SQuAD format was constructed using the university book of modules, supplemented with manually and synthetically generated entries. We fine-tuned BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) using PyTorch and evaluated performance with Exact Match and F1 scores. Results show that even modest fine-tuning improves hypothesis framing and knowledge extraction, demonstrating the feasibility of adapting foundation models to educational domains. While domain-specific BERT variants such as BioBERT and SciBERT exist for biomedical and scientific literature, no foundation model has yet been tailored to university course materials.

However, existing active reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics, which can lead to redundant observations without substantially improving reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose AREA3D, an active reconstruction agent that leverages feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and vision-language guidance. Our framework decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. In addition, an integrated vision-language model provides high-level semantic guidance, encouraging informative and diverse viewpoints beyond purely geometric cues. Extensive experiments on both scene-level and object-level benchmarks demonstrate that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime.

This paper introduces a large-language-model (LLM)-driven conversational assistant that captures such knowledge on the shop floor and converts it incrementally and interactively into standards-compliant Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 diagrams. Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro and delivered through a lightweight Gradio front-end with client-side bpmn-js visualisation, the assistant conducts an interview-style dialogue: it elicits process details, supports clarifying dialogue and on-demand analysis, and renders live diagrams that users can refine in real time. A proof-of-concept evaluation in an equipment-maintenance scenario shows that the chatbot produced an accurate \"AS-IS\" model, flagged issues via on-diagram annotations, and generated an improved \"TO-BE\" variant, all within about 12-minutes, while keeping API costs within an SME-friendly budget. The study analyses latency sources, model-selection trade-offs, and the challenges of enforcing strict XML schemas, then outlines a roadmap toward agentic and multimodal deployments.

These include computational constraints, the limitations of single-view learning algorithms and the complexity of processing large datasets from different domains, sources or views. In this context, multi-view clustering (MVC), a class of unsupervised multi-view learning, emerges as a powerful approach to overcome these challenges. MVC compensates for the shortcomings of single-view methods and provides a richer data representation and effective solutions for a variety of unsupervised learning tasks. In contrast to traditional single-view approaches, the semantically rich nature of multi-view data increases its practical utility despite its inherent complexity. This survey makes a threefold contribution: (1) a systematic categorization of multi-view clustering methods into well-defined groups, including co-training, co-regularization, subspace, deep learning, kernel-based, anchor-based, and graph-based strategies; (2) an in-depth analysis of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and practical challenges, such as scalability and incomplete data; and (3) a forward-looking discussion of emerging trends, interdisciplinary applications, and future directions in MVC research. This study represents an extensive workload, encompassing the review of over 140 foundational and recent publications, the development of comparative insights on integration strategies such as early fusion, late fusion, and joint learning, and the structured investigation of practical use cases in the areas of healthcare, multimedia, and social network analysis.

However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented. Our solution demonstrates superior performance in terms of simplicity of implementation, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to the state of the art.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as automated assessors, showing promising alignment with human annotations. Most prior studies have treated documents as fixed units, feeding their full content directly to LLM assessors. We investigate how text summarization affects the reliability of LLM-based judgments and their downstream impact on IR evaluation. Using state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple TREC collections, we compare judgments made from full documents with those based on LLM-generated summaries of different lengths. We examine their agreement with human labels, their effect on retrieval effectiveness evaluation, and their influence on IR systems' ranking stability. Our findings show that summary-based judgments achieve comparable stability in systems' ranking to full-document judgments, while introducing systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that vary by model and dataset. These results highlight summarization as both an opportunity for more efficient large-scale IR evaluation and a methodological choice with important implications for the reliability of automatic judgments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u8fdb\u884c\u6458\u8981\u5904\u7406\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff08IR\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5168\u6587\u5224\u65ad\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u800c\u5f02\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u6587\uff0c\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8003\u5bdf\u6458\u8981\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aTREC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u6587\u4e0e\u6458\u8981\u7684LLM\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5bf9IR\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u6458\u8981\u57fa\u5224\u65ad\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6392\u5e8f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5168\u6587\u57fa\u5224\u65ad\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u53d1\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u6a21\u578b/\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u65e2\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21IR\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u5bf9\u5f85\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model. While we focus on inpainting, PELC is a general recipe for pixel-equivalent latent editing, as we demonstrate on a complex color-correction task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u50cf\u7d20\u7b49\u6548\u6f5c\u5728\u5408\u6210\uff08PELC\uff09\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1DecFormer\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a9\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8f6f\u8fb9alpha\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4fee\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a9\u7801\u8fb9\u7f18\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u9000\u5316\u548c\u989c\u8272\u504f\u79fb\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPELC\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea77.7M\u53c2\u6570\u7684DecFormer Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u6d41\u5f62\u5916\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u4f7f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u540e\u89e3\u7801\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4alpha\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728FLUX.1\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cDecFormer\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590d\u5168\u5c40\u989c\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u652f\u6301\u8f6f\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u9510\u5229\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u6700\u9ad8\u964d\u4f4e53%\uff1b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fee\u590d\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u8f7b\u91cfLoRA\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u5fae\u8c03FLUX.1-Fill\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PELC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7b49\u6548\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u4e5f\u6210\u529f\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u590d\u6742\u989c\u8272\u6821\u6b63\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u51c6\u5219\u3002"}}

Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014Scale Anchoring\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FRL\uff09\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u951a\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bef\u5dee\u4e00\u81f4\u89c6\u4e3a\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u968f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5948\u594e\u65af\u7279\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u5f81\u9ad8\u9891\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8bef\u5dee\u88ab\u951a\u5b9a\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FRL\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u9891\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u5948\u594e\u65af\u7279\u9891\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0b\u9ad8\u9891\u6bb5\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "FRL\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u5fae\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "Scale Anchoring\u662f\u5236\u7ea6\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6839\u672c\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0cFRL\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control.

However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies.

We present a unified, GNSS-independent mapping system that fuses LiDAR-IMU with a dual, orthogonally mounted Forward Looking Sonars (FLS) to generate consistent seabed-to-sky maps from an Autonomous Surface Vehicle. On the acoustic side, we extend orthogonal wide-aperture fusion to handle arbitrary inter-sonar translations (enabling heterogeneous, non-co-located models) and extract a leading edge from each FLS to form line-scans. On the mapping side, we modify LIO-SAM to ingest both stereo-derived 3D sonar points and leading-edge line-scans at and between keyframes via motion-interpolated poses, allowing sparse acoustic updates to contribute continuously to a single factor-graph map. We validate the system on real-world data from Belvederekanalen (Copenhagen), demonstrating real-time operation with approx. 2.65 Hz map updates and approx. 2.85 Hz odometry while producing a unified 3D model that spans air-water domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56GNSS\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6d77\u5e8a-\u5929\u7a7a\u6d4b\u7ed8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u878d\u5408LiDAR-IMU\u4e0e\u6b63\u4ea4\u524d\u89c6\u58f0\u5450\uff08FLS\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8de8\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e09\u7ef4\u5efa\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5173\u952e\u6d77\u4e0a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e9f\u9700\u6c34\u9762\u53ca\u6c34\u4e0b\u6001\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u2018\u6d77\u5e8a\u5230\u5929\u7a7a\u2019\u6d4b\u7ed8\u65b9\u6848\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u6613\u53d7\u906e\u6321/\u6b3a\u9a97\u7684GNSS\uff0c\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6d4b\u6df1\u58f0\u5450\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cdGNSS\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6d4b\u7ed8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u58f0\u5b66\u7aef\u6269\u5c55\u6b63\u4ea4\u5bbd\u5b54\u5f84\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u975e\u5171\u7f6e\u5f02\u6784\u58f0\u5450\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u53ccFLS\u63d0\u53d6\u524d\u6cbf\u5f62\u6210\u7ebf\u626b\u63cf\uff1b2\uff09\u6539\u8fdbLIO-SAM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u878d\u5408\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u76843D\u58f0\u5450\u70b9\u4e91\u548c\u524d\u6cbf\u7ebf\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d2\u503c\u59ff\u6001\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u58f0\u5b66\u66f4\u65b0\u6301\u7eed\u878d\u5165\u5355\u4e00\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u5730\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u54e5\u672c\u54c8\u6839Belvederekanalen\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea62.65 Hz\u5730\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e2.85 Hz\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8986\u76d6\u7a7a\u6c14-\u6c34\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u7edf\u4e003D\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86GNSS\u62d2\u6b62\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8de8\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e09\u7ef4\u6d4b\u7ed8\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u6c34\u9762\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5168\u6808\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This research presents a systematic framework for metadata enrichment using large language models (LLMs) to enhance document retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our approach employs a comprehensive, structured pipeline that dynamically generates meaningful metadata for document segments, substantially improving their semantic representations and retrieval accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we compare three chunking strategies-semantic, recursive, and naive-and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with advanced embedding techniques. The results demonstrate that metadata-enriched approaches consistently outperform content-only baselines, with recursive chunking paired with TF-IDF weighted embeddings yielding an 82.5% precision rate compared to 73.3% for semantic content-only approaches. The naive chunking strategy with prefix-fusion achieved the highest Hit Rate@10 of 0.925. Our evaluation employs cross-encoder reranking for ground truth generation, enabling rigorous assessment via Hit Rate and Metadata Consistency metrics. These findings confirm that metadata enrichment enhances vector clustering quality while reducing retrieval latency, making it a key optimization for RAG systems across knowledge domains. This work offers practical insights for deploying high-performance, scalable document retrieval solutions in enterprise settings, demonstrating that metadata enrichment is a powerful approach for enhancing RAG effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e3a\u6587\u6863\u7247\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bed\u4e49/\u9012\u5f52/\u6734\u7d20\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u4e0eTF-IDF\u52a0\u6743\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u524d\u7f00\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u771f\u503c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30Hit Rate@10\u4e0e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5143\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u5185\u5bb9\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1a\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u5757+TF-IDF\u52a0\u6743\u5d4c\u5165\u8fbe82.5%\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08vs. 73.3%\uff09\uff1b\u6734\u7d20\u5206\u5757+\u524d\u7f00\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad8Hit Rate@10=0.925\uff1b\u5143\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5411\u91cf\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u7d22\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5143\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u662f\u4f18\u5316RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u9886\u57df\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches based on diffusion or optimization are ill-suited for this task, as they are often prohibitively slow, destructive to the original asset's identity, or lack the precision for fine-grained control. To address this, we introduce \\ourmethod, a state-aware feedforward model that enables continuous editing of 3D Gaussian assets from user-provided 2D view(s). Our method directly predicts updates to the attributes of a compact, feature-rich Gaussian representation and leverages Test-Time Training to create a state-aware, iterative workflow.

Then, the paper uses poetic prompts to assess descriptions and evaluations of three models of a renowned poet and test the consequences of the willingness of models to adapt or rewrite original creative works for presumed audiences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bd7\u6b4c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bd7\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8457\u540d\u8bd7\u4eba\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u6539\u5199\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u521b\u9020\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u503e\u5411\u4e0e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u8bd7\u6b4c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08Poetry Prompt Patterns\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bd7\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8457\u540d\u8bd7\u4eba\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u8bc4\u4ef7\u53ca\u6539\u5199\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8bd7\u610f\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u6539\u5199\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u539f\u521b\u6587\u5b66\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u7684\u503e\u5411\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bd7\u6b4c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u521b\u610f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity. Experiments show that InvarDiff achieves $2$-$3\\times$ end-to-end speed-ups with minimal impact on standard quality metrics.

We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters.

Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation.

Clinical notes for patients' assessments, diagnoses, and treatments are captured in these EHRs in free-form text by physicians, who spend a considerable amount of time entering and editing them. Manually writing clinical notes takes a considerable amount of a doctor's valuable time, increasing the patient's waiting time and possibly delaying diagnoses. Large language models (LLMs) possess the ability to generate news articles that closely resemble human-written ones. We investigate the usage of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt engineering to improve the LLM's response in clinical note generation. In our prompts, we use as input International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and basic patient information.

Accurate identification of the culprit vessel and assessment of stenosis severity are essential for guiding individualized therapy. Although coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is the first-line non-invasive modality for CAD diagnosis, its dependence on high-end equipment, radiation exposure, and strict patient cooperation limits large-scale use. With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA. On the internal validation set, the model's AUCs for the right coronary artery (RCA), left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCX) were 0.794, 0.818, 0.744, and 0.755, respectively; on the external validation set, the AUCs reached 0.749, 0.971, 0.667, and 0.727, respectively. Performance remained stable in a clinically normal-ECG subset, indicating robustness beyond overt ECG abnormalities. Subgroup analyses across demographic and acquisition-time strata further confirmed model stability. Risk stratification based on vessel-specific incidence thresholds showed consistent separation on calibration and cumulative event curves. Interpretability analyses revealed distinct waveform differences between high- and low-risk groups, highlighting key electrophysiological regions contributing to model decisions and offering new insights into the ECG correlates of coronary stenosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI-ECG\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u521b\u9884\u6d4b\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109CT\u8840\u7ba1\u6210\u50cf\uff08CCTA\uff09\u4e2d\u56db\u652f\u4e3b\u8981\u51a0\u8109\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u72ed\u7a84\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u5de6\u4e3b\u5e72\u52a8\u8109\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff08AUC=0.971\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u7535\u751f\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u75be\u75c5\uff08CAD\uff09\u5168\u7403\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfCCTA\u867d\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ebf\u8bca\u65ad\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u914d\u5408\uff1b\u800cAI-ECG\u56e0\u4fbf\u6377\u3001\u65e0\u8f90\u5c04\u3001\u666e\u53ca\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21CAD\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI-ECG\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6807\u51c612\u5bfc\u8054\u9759\u606f\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u9884\u6d4bCCTA\u4e0a\u53f3\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\uff08RCA\uff09\u3001\u5de6\u4e3b\u5e72\uff08LM\uff09\u3001\u524d\u964d\u652f\uff08LAD\uff09\u548c\u56de\u65cb\u652f\uff08LCX\uff09\u7684\u4e25\u91cd/\u5b8c\u5168\u72ed\u7a84\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e9a\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u53ca\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u6ce2\u5f62\u5dee\u5f02\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5185\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1AUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.794\uff08RCA\uff09\u30010.818\uff08LM\uff09\u30010.744\uff08LAD\uff09\u30010.755\uff08LCX\uff09\uff1b\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1AUC\u8fbe0.749\uff08RCA\uff09\u30010.971\uff08LM\uff09\u30010.667\uff08LAD\uff09\u30010.727\uff08LCX\uff09\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5b50\u96c6\u53ca\u591a\u4e9a\u7ec4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u7535\u751f\u7406\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5AI-ECG\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u65e0\u521b\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u652f\u51a0\u8109\u4e25\u91cd\u72ed\u7a84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u5de6\u4e3b\u5e72\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u4e0e\u51a0\u8109\u72ed\u7a84\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7535\u751f\u7406\u5173\u8054\u3002"}}

So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4efb\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ecAI\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u6b63\u521b\u65b0\u6216\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u5df2\u6709\u529f\u80fd\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684AGI\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\uff08AGI\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u521b\u9020\u6027\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u5df2\u6709AGI\u5b9a\u4e49\uff08\u5373\u5728\u67d0\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5730\u89e3\u9501\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u7406\u8bba\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u521d\u59cb\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u672a\u5305\u542b\u7684\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u4efb\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ecAI\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e0d\u80fd\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u521d\u59cb\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5b83\u4ec5\u80fd\u5c55\u73b0\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6216\u6392\u5217\u5df2\u6709\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u7684AGI\uff08\u5177\u5907\u539f\u521b\u6027\u521b\u9020\u529b\uff09\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u8fd9\u5bf9AI\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u53ca\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u8d77\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u6df1\u8fdc\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

As a result, genomic data vastly outpace available phenotypic labels, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised models. We hypothesize that combining pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can retain high predictive accuracy even when labeled data are scarce. We evaluated two SSL strategies, Self-training and Label Spreading, against fully supervised baselines using four PLM-derived embeddings (ESM-2, ProtVec, ProtT5, ProtBert) applied to haemagglutinin (HA) sequences. A nested cross-validation framework simulated low-label regimes (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% label availability) across four IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H9N2). SSL consistently improved performance under label scarcity. Self-training with ProtVec produced the largest relative gains, showing that SSL can compensate for lower-resolution representations. ESM-2 remained highly robust, achieving F1 scores above 0.82 with only 25% labeled data, indicating that its embeddings capture key antigenic determinants. While H1N1 and H9N2 were predicted with high accuracy, the hypervariable H3N2 subtype remained challenging, although SSL mitigated the performance decline.

The approach employs circular STT, characterized by smoothly time-varying center and radius, to define dynamic safe corridors that guide the robot from the start region to the goal while avoiding obstacles. In particular, we first develop a sampling-based synthesis algorithm to construct a feasible STT that satisfies the prescribed timing and safety constraints with formal guarantees. To ensure that the robot remains confined within this tube, we then design analytically a closed-form, approximation-free control law. The resulting controller is computationally efficient, robust to disturbances and {model uncertainties}, and requires no model approximations or online optimization. The proposed framework is validated through simulation studies on a differential-drive robot and benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ba1\uff08STT\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5dee\u901f\u9a71\u52a8\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u5230\u8fbe-\u907f\u969c-\u505c\u7559\uff08T-RAS\uff09\u89c4\u8303\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u65f6\u53d8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0e\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u5706\u5f62STT\u5b9a\u4e49\u52a8\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u8d70\u5eca\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u5408\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u89e3\u6790\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5dee\u901f\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4e25\u683c\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982T-RAS\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5706\u5f62\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ba1\uff08STT\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u8d70\u5eca\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91c7\u6837\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53ef\u884cSTT\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u65e0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f4d\u4e8eSTT\u5185\u3002", "result": "\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u5f3a\u3001\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6216\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0STT\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u7ea6\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While music information retrieval and computational musicology have explored structured and multimodal understanding, few resources support factual and contextual music question answering (MQA) grounded in artist metadata or historical context. We introduce MusWikiDB, a vector database of 3.2M passages from 144K music-related Wikipedia pages, and ArtistMus, a benchmark of 1,000 questions on 500 diverse artists with metadata such as genre, debut year, and topic. These resources enable systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for MQA. Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus.

However, ICL with CoT examples is ineffective on novel tasks when the pre-training knowledge is insufficient. We study this problem in a controlled setting using the CoT-ICL Lab framework, and propose meta-training techniques to learn novel abstract reasoning tasks in-context. Although CoT examples facilitate reasoning, we noticed that their excessive inclusion during meta-training degrades performance when CoT supervision is limited. To mitigate such behavior, we propose CoT-Recipe, a formal approach to modulate the mix of CoT and non-CoT examples in meta-training sequences. We demonstrate that careful modulation via CoT-Recipe can increase the accuracy of transformers on novel tasks by up to 300% even when there are no CoT examples available in-context. We confirm the broader effectiveness of these techniques by applying them to pretrained LLMs (Qwen2.5 series) for symbolic reasoning tasks and observing gains of up to 130% in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoT-Recipe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7\u5143\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u4e0e\u975eCoT\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587CoT\u793a\u4f8b\u65f6\u5bf9\u65b0\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6216\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCoT-ICL Lab\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u5143\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8fc7\u591aCoT\u793a\u4f8b\u53cd\u800c\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u63d0\u51faCoT-Recipe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8c03\u63a7\u5143\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2dCoT\u4e0e\u975eCoT\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587CoT\u793a\u4f8b\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe300%\uff1b\u5728Qwen2.5\u7cfb\u5217\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe130%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u7406\u8c03\u63a7\u5143\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684CoT\u793a\u4f8b\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff08\u5373CoT-Recipe\uff09\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u5bf9\u65b0\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728CoT\u76d1\u7763\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u4f18\u52bf\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce ChromouVQA, a large-scale, multi-task benchmark based on Ishihara-style chromatic camouflaged images. We extend classic dot plates with multiple fill geometries and vary chromatic separation, density, size, occlusion, and rotation, recording full metadata for reproducibility. The benchmark covers nine vision-question-answering tasks, including recognition, counting, comparison, and spatial reasoning. Evaluations of humans and VLMs reveal large gaps, especially under subtle chromatic contrast or disruptive geometric fills. We also propose a model-agnostic contrastive recipe aligning silhouettes with their camouflaged renderings, improving recovery of global shapes.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to address this by minimising domain discrepancy during training, but the discrepancy estimates suffer from high variance in stochastic settings, which can stifle the theoretical benefits of the method. This paper proposes Variance-Reduced Domain Adaptation via Stratified Sampling (VaRDASS), the first specialised stochastic variance reduction technique for UDA. We consider two specific discrepancy measures -- correlation alignment and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- and derive ad hoc stratification objectives for these terms.

This wastes inference-time compute and can hurt accuracy. Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\\% fewer tokens. Compared to state-of-the-art early-exit methods, LYNX offers competitive or superior Pareto frontiers while remaining fully online, requiring no proxy models at inference, and providing explicit, user-tunable confidence guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLYNX\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u505c\u6b62\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406token\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u800c\u6d6a\u8d39\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u635f\u5bb3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u8f85\u52a9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "LYNX\u5c06\u9000\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u63a8\u7406\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u5982\u201chmm\u201d\u3001\u201cwait\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u63a2\u9488\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5236\u9000\u51fa\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u88c2\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u63a2\u9488\u4ec5\u9700\u5728\u901a\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u3001MATH-500\u3001AIME 2024\u548cCommonsenseQA\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cLYNX\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4etoken\u4f7f\u7528\uff0835%\u201370%\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8c03\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "LYNX\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods. This advancement has significant implications for improving environmental exposure assessment and long term environmental monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7U-Net\u8fc1\u79fb\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7c97\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u4e9a\u6d32\u533a\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0R\u00b2=0.65\u20130.94\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u7c97\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9065\u611f/\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982MERRA-2\uff09\u5411\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08\u59827 km\uff09\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u53ca\u9700\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u5148\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7c97\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cfU-Net\u5e76\u51bb\u7ed3\u5176\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b\u518d\u5c06\u8be5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63a5\u5165\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6e90\u57df\uff08MERRA-2\uff09\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\uff08G5NR\uff09\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u51bb\u7ed3\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6309\u4e9a\u533a\u4e0e\u5b63\u8282\u5212\u5206\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97R\u00b2=0.65\u20130.94\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027U-Net\u3001VAE\u53ca\u65e2\u6709\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u534a\u53d8\u5f02\u51fd\u6570\u3001ACF/PACF\u548c\u6ede\u540eRMSE/R\u00b2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u56fe\u50cf\u5177\u5907\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u51faG5NR\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7c97\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u56fe\u50cf\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u66b4\u9732\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We introduce MAR-FL, a novel P2P FL system that leverages iterative group-based aggregation to substantially reduce communication overhead while retaining resilience to churn. MAR-FL achieves communication costs that scale as O(N log N), contrasting with the O(N^2) complexity of previously existing baselines, and thereby maintains effectiveness especially as the number of peers in an aggregation round grows.

We leverage flow matching to learn a semantically preserving mapping that transports from the source to the target image distribution. This allows us to tackle challenging domain adaptation configurations for classification and semantic segmentation of Earth observation images. We conduct extensive experiments across four datasets covering adaptation scenarios such as SAR to optical translation and temporal and semantic shifts caused by natural disasters.

This paper introduces a completely innovative architecture and concept: combining the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a specific clinical application, known as MCP-AI. This integration allows intelligent agents to reason over extended periods, collaborate securely, and adhere to authentic clinical logic, representing a significant shift away from traditional Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and prompt-based Large Language Models (LLMs). As healthcare systems become more complex, the need for autonomous, context-aware clinical reasoning frameworks has become urgent. We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object. Unlike conventional CDSS or stateless prompt-based AI systems, MCP-AI supports adaptive, longitudinal, and collaborative reasoning across care settings. MCP-AI is validated through two use cases: (1) diagnostic modeling of Fragile X Syndrome with comorbid depression, and (2) remote coordination for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. In either scenario, the protocol facilitates physician-in-the-loop validation, streamlines clinical processes, and guarantees secure transitions of AI responsibilities between healthcare providers. The system connects with HL7/FHIR interfaces and adheres to regulatory standards, such as HIPAA and FDA SaMD guidelines.

Final version available at: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-72344-5_7", "summary": "As a classical approach on graph learning, the propagation-aggregation methodology is widely exploited by many of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), wherein the representation of a node is updated by aggregating representations from itself and neighbor nodes recursively. Similar to the propagation-aggregation methodology, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) algorithm tests isomorphism through color refinement according to color representations of a node and its neighbor nodes. However, 1-WL does not leverage any edge features (labels), presenting a potential improvement on exploiting edge features in some fields. To address this limitation, we proposed a novel Edged-WL algorithm (E-WL) which extends the original 1-WL algorithm to incorporate edge features. Building upon the E-WL algorithm, we also introduce an Edged Graph Isomorphism Network (EGIN) model for further exploiting edge features, which addresses one key drawback in many GNNs that do not utilize any edge features of graph data. We evaluated the performance of proposed models using 12 edge-featured benchmark graph datasets and compared them with some state-of-the-art baseline models. Experimental results indicate that our proposed EGIN models, in general, demonstrate superior performance in graph learning on graph classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Edged-WL\uff08E-WL\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u7684Weisfeiler-Lehman\uff081-WL\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Edged Graph Isomorphism Network\uff08EGIN\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u51781-WL\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNNs\uff09\u4e5f\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8fb9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u542b\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEdged-WL\uff08E-WL\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5165\u989c\u8272\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eE-WL\u8bbe\u8ba1Edged Graph Isomorphism Network\uff08EGIN\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u542b\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cEGIN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6574\u4f53\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u540c\u6784\u5224\u522b\u4e0e\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0cE-WL\u548cEGIN\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Moreover, as battery energy densities continue to rise, improper handling during recycling poses significant safety hazards, including potential fires at recycling facilities. Numerous systems have been proposed for battery detection and removal from WEEE recycling lines, including X-ray and RGB-based visual inspection methods, typically driven by AI-powered object detection models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, YOLO, ResNets). Despite advances in optimizing detection techniques and model modifications, a fully autonomous solution capable of accurately identifying and sorting batteries across diverse WEEEs types has yet to be realized. In response to these challenges, we present our novel approach which integrates a specialized X-ray transmission dual energy imaging subsystem with advanced pre-processing algorithms, enabling high-contrast image reconstruction for effective differentiation of dense and thin materials in WEEE. Devices move along a conveyor belt through a high-resolution X-ray imaging system, where YOLO and U-Net models precisely detect and segment battery-containing items. An intelligent tracking and position estimation algorithm then guides a Delta robot equipped with a suction gripper to selectively extract and properly discard the targeted devices.

We challenge the naive assumption that linguistic change is simplification by quantitatively analyzing over 2,000 years of Sanskrit, demonstrating how weakly-supervised hybrid methods can yield new insights into the evolution of morphologically rich, low-resource languages. Our approach addresses data scarcity through weak supervision, using 100+ high-precision regex patterns to generate pseudo-labels for fine-tuning a multilingual BERT. We then fuse symbolic and neural outputs via a novel confidence-weighted ensemble, creating a system that is both scalable and interpretable. Applying this framework to a 1.47-million-word diachronic corpus, our ensemble achieves a 52.4% overall feature detection rate. Our findings reveal that Sanskrit's overall morphological complexity does not decrease but is instead dynamically redistributed: while earlier verbal features show cyclical patterns of decline, complexity shifts to other domains, evidenced by a dramatic expansion in compounding and the emergence of new philosophical terminology.

Current methods for training VLM judges mainly rely on large-scale human preference annotations. However, such an approach is costly, and the annotations easily become obsolete as models rapidly improve. In this work, we present a framework to self-train a VLM judge model without any human preference annotations, using only self-synthesized data. Our method is iterative and has three stages: (1) generate diverse multimodal instruction-response pairs at varying quality levels, (2) generate reasoning traces and judgments for each pair, removing the ones that do not match our expected quality levels, and (3) training on correct judge answers and their reasoning traces. We evaluate the resulting judge on Multimodal RewardBench and VL-RewardBench across domains: correctness, preference, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our method improves a Llama-3.2-11B multimodal judge from 0.38 to 0.51 in overall accuracy on VL-RewardBench, often outperforming much larger models including Llama-3.2-90B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with particularly strong gains in general, hallucination, and reasoning dimensions.

These hardware bottlenecks confine quantum PDE solvers to low-fidelity regimes despite their theoretical potential for computational speedup. We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel scenario-aware uncertainty quantification framework to provide the predicted trajectories with prediction intervals and reliability assessment. To begin with, predicted trajectories from the trained predictor and their ground truth are projected onto the map-derived reference routes within the Frenet coordinate system. We then employ CopulaCPTS as the conformal calibration method to generate temporal prediction intervals for distinct scenarios as the uncertainty measure. Building upon this, within the proposed trajectory reliability discriminator (TRD), mean error and calibrated confidence intervals are synergistically analyzed to establish reliability models for different scenarios.

Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u81ea\u504f\u597d\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373LM\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u5df1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u9ed1\u76d2\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u7cca\u7b54\u6848\u6765\u6e90\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u81ea\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u8bd5\u56fe\u5b8c\u5168\u4e2d\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u504f\u597d\u4ecd\u4f1a\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u6839\u690d\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5f7b\u5e95\u6d88\u9664\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "LM judges\u5b58\u5728\u81ea\u504f\u597d\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5373\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u516c\u6b63\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u524d\u6cbfLM\u80fd\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ed1\u76d2\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u7b49\uff09\u5bf9\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u7684\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u524a\u5f31LM judge\u5bf9\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u81ea\u504f\u597d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u5c11\u91cf\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\uff09\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u964d\u4f4e\u81ea\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u4f46\u5f53\u6270\u52a8\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u4e2d\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u504f\u597d\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u81ea\u504f\u597d\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u504f\u597d\u6e90\u4e8eLM\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u8868\u9762\u6270\u52a8\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u9664\uff1b\u5b8c\u5168\u4e2d\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5dee\u5f02\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u66b4\u9732\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u504f\u5dee\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f7b\u5e95\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

These models are typically built upon multi-step frameworks like diffusion and flow matching, which inherently limits their inference efficiency (requiring 40-100 Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs)). While various few-step methods aim to accelerate the inference, existing solutions have clear limitations. Prominent distillation-based methods, such as progressive and consistency distillation, either require an iterative distillation procedure or show significant degradation at very few steps (< 4-NFE). Meanwhile, integrating adversarial training into distillation (e.g., DMD/DMD2 and SANA-Sprint) to enhance performance introduces training instability, added complexity, and high GPU memory overhead due to the auxiliary trained models. To this end, we propose TwinFlow, a simple yet effective framework for training 1-step generative models that bypasses the need of fixed pretrained teacher models and avoids standard adversarial networks during training, making it ideal for building large-scale, efficient models. On text-to-image tasks, our method achieves a GenEval score of 0.83 in 1-NFE, outperforming strong baselines like SANA-Sprint (a GAN loss-based framework) and RCGM (a consistency-based framework). Notably, we demonstrate the scalability of TwinFlow by full-parameter training on Qwen-Image-20B and transform it into an efficient few-step generator. With just 1-NFE, our approach matches the performance of the original 100-NFE model on both the GenEval and DPG-Bench benchmarks, reducing computational cost by $100\\times$ with minor quality degradation.

We formalize the verification problem, prove soundness of our approach, and evaluate BEAVER on correctness verification, privacy verification and secure code generation tasks across multiple state of the art LLMs. BEAVER achieves 6 to 8 times tighter probability bounds and identifies 3 to 4 times more high risk instances compared to baseline methods under identical computational budgets, enabling precise characterization and risk assessment that loose bounds or empirical evaluation cannot provide.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BEAVER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6b63\u786e\u6982\u7387\u754c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u578btoken trie\u4e0efrontier\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001sound\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4e9f\u9700\u5177\u5907sound\u6982\u7387\u754c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBEAVER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u524d\u7f00\u95ed\u5408\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5229\u7528token trie\u548cfrontier\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u904d\u5386\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ef4\u6301\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cBEAVER\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f976\u20138\u500d\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u6982\u7387\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u53d1\u73b03\u20134\u500d\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "BEAVER\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14sound\u7684LLM\u7ea6\u675f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5bbd\u677e\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces.

However, these approaches either require additional test-time compute or assume access to more powerful teacher models, making them costly and less practical. In this work, we propose Self Critique and Refinement-based Preference Optimization (SCRPO), which is a self-supervised training framework that first constructs a preference dataset by leveraging the LLM's own critique and refinement capabilities, and then applies preference learning to improve the same LLM for faithful summarization. Experiments on three summarization benchmarks (XSUM CNNDM and SAMSum), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in terms of faithfulness metrics while either maintaining or improving other metrics that measure the overall quality of the summary.

However, class-conditional generation methods based on diffusion models often focus on more common categories. In large-scale fine-grained image generation, issues of semantic information entanglement and insufficient detail in the generated images still persist. This paper attempts to introduce a concept of a tiered embedder in fine-grained image generation, which integrates semantic information from both super and child classes, allowing the diffusion model to better incorporate semantic information and address the issue of semantic entanglement.

In human philosophy, this tension between global judgment and local impulse is called akrasia, or weakness of will. We propose akrasia as a foundational concept for analyzing inconsistency and goal drift in agentic AI systems. To operationalize it, we introduce a preliminary version of the Akrasia Benchmark, currently a structured set of prompting conditions (Baseline [B], Synonym [S], Temporal [T], and Temptation [X]) that measures when a model's local response contradicts its own prior commitments. The benchmark enables quantitative comparison of \"self-control\" across model families, decoding strategies, and temptation types. Beyond single-model evaluation, we outline how micro-level akrasia may compound into macro-level instability in multi-agent systems that may be interpreted as \"scheming\" or deliberate misalignment.

However, traditional wet lab experiments are limited by efficiency and cost constraints, making it difficult to extensively explore potential associations between developed drugs and target miRNAs. Therefore, we have designed a novel machine learning model based on a multi-layer transformer-based graph neural network, DMAGT, specifically for predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\\pm0.05$. DMAGT demonstrated superior performance in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges. To validate its practical efficacy, we specifically focused on two drugs, namely 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. Of the 20 potential drug-miRNA associations identified as the most likely, 14 were successfully validated.

For example, W4A8 can only achieve the same peak TOPS as W8A8 whereas the GPU-supported sparse data format (2:4 semi-structure sparse) is seldomly adopted due to the loss of accuracy. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose the Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format), which is a unified data format for quantization and sparsification potentially easily supported by new hardware and existing GPUs. SQ-format makes use of the fact that sparse matrix can be accelerated in high-precision, and low-precision matrix multiplication can also be accelerated accordingly. As such, SQ-format is proposed to achieve Pareto improvement between performance and throughput. This format is particularly suitable for activations with outlier inequality status and makes their static compression possible. We show the state-of-the-art PTQ performance with SQ-format, propose the hardware required to support it, and further offer the design exploration and insights for the next-generation AI accelerators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a00\u758f-\u91cf\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\uff08SQ-format\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\uff08PTQ\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u73b0\u6709GPU\u53ca\u65b0\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\uff08\u5982W4A8\uff09\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\uff08\u59822:4\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u7a00\u758f\uff09\u6280\u672f\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u786c\u534f\u540c\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSparse-Quantized Format\uff08SQ-format\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u52a0\u901f\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8fdb\u884c\u9759\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u5728PTQ\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u652f\u6301SQ-format\u6240\u9700\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u5411\u4e0e\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "SQ-format\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u6027\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8LLM\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u4e0e\u666e\u53ca\u5316\u3002"}}

To tackle this problem, we introduce Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations (Semore), a new VLM-based framework for visual RL, which can simultaneously extract semantic and motion representations through a dual-path backbone from the RGB flows. Semore utilizes VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information from observations, while using the pre-trained clip to achieve the text-image alignment, thereby embedding the ground-truth representations into the backbone. To efficiently fuse semantic and motion representations for decision-making, our method adopts a separately supervised approach to simultaneously guide the extraction of semantics and motion, while allowing them to interact spontaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the guidance of VLM at the feature level, our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods.

However, they suffer from limited multi-rationale semantic modeling, insufficient logical robustness, and are susceptible to misleading interpretations in complex scenarios. Therefore, we propose a Multi-rationale INtegrated Discriminative (MIND) reasoning framework, which is designed to endow MLLMs with human-like cognitive abilities of \"Understand -> Rethink -> Correct\", and achieves a paradigm evolution from passive imitation-based reasoning to active discriminative reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a Rationale Augmentation and Discrimination (RAD) paradigm, which automatically and efficiently expands existing datasets by generating diverse rationales, providing a unified and extensible data foundation. Meanwhile, we design a Progressive Two-stage Correction Learning (P2CL) strategy. The first phase enhances multi-rationale positive learning, while the second phase enables active logic discrimination and correction. In addition, to mitigate representation entanglement in the multi-rationale semantic space, we propose a Multi-rationale Contrastive Alignment (MCA) optimization strategy, which achieves semantic aggregation of correct reasoning and boundary separation of incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIND reasoning framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets covering scientific, commonsense, and mathematical scenarios. It provides a new perspective for advancing MLLMs towards higher levels of cognitive intelligence.

Current explainable RL methods seldom use state attributions to assist training. Rather, they treat all state features equally, thereby neglecting the heterogeneous impacts of individual state dimensions on the reward. We propose RKHS--SHAP-based Advanced Actor--Critic (RSA2C), an attribution-aware, kernelized, two-timescale AC algorithm, including Actor, Value Critic, and Advantage Critic. The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs. These RKHS-enhanced components use sparsified dictionaries: the Value Critic maintains its own dictionary, while the Actor and Advantage Critic share one. State attributions, computed from the Value Critic via RKHS--SHAP (kernel mean embedding for on-manifold expectations and conditional mean embedding for off-manifold expectations), are converted into Mahalanobis-gated weights that modulate Actor gradients and Advantage Critic targets.

A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u7684CT-free 3D\u7a7f\u690e\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u5e73\u9762X\u5149\u7247\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u672f\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u690e\u4f53\u6210\u5f62\u672f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u672f\u524dCT\u626b\u63cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u4f9d\u8d56\u672f\u524dCT\u4e0e\u672f\u4e2d2D\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u690e\u4f53\u6210\u5f62\u672f\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u672f\u524dCT\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u690e\u4f53\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316SSM\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u4f4d\u59ff\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2X\u5149\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u690e\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u5efaDICE\u8fbe0.75\uff08\u4f18\u4e8eNCC\u57fa\u7ebf0.65\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1ReVerteR\u76840.77\uff09\uff1b\u53cc\u4fa7\u7a7f\u690e\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e82%\uff0c\u5c38\u68c0\u6570\u636e75%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e2D-to-3D\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0866%\u548c31%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u65e0\u9700CT\u76843D\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684X\u5149\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u690e\u4f53\u6210\u5f62\u672f\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/June01/CureAgent", "summary": "Current clinical agent built on small LLMs, such as TxAgent suffer from a \\textit{Context Utilization Failure}, where models successfully retrieve biomedical evidence due to supervised finetuning but fail to ground their diagnosis in that information. In this work, we propose the Executor-Analyst Framework, a modular architecture that decouples the syntactic precision of tool execution from the semantic robustness of clinical reasoning. By orchestrating specialized TxAgents (Executors) with long-context foundation models (Analysts), we mitigate the reasoning deficits observed in monolithic models. Beyond simple modularity, we demonstrate that a Stratified Ensemble strategy significantly outperforms global pooling by preserving evidentiary diversity, effectively addressing the information bottleneck. Furthermore, our stress tests reveal critical scaling insights: (1) a \\textit{Context-Performance Paradox}, where extending reasoning contexts beyond 12k tokens introduces noise that degrades accuracy; and (2) the \\textit{Curse of Dimensionality} in action spaces, where expanding toolsets necessitates hierarchical retrieval strategies.

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faContinuous Flow Operator (CFO)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60PDE\u53f3\u7aef\u9879\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5bf9\u65f6\u53d8PDE\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "CFO\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u62df\u5408\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u6837\u6761\uff0c\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u8282\u70b9\u5904\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u903c\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9ePDE\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u518d\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u6790\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Lorenz\u30011D Burgers\u30012D\u6269\u6563-\u53cd\u5e94\u30012D\u6d45\u6c34\u65b9\u7a0b\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCFO\u5728\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1a\u4ec5\u752825%\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u70b9\u5373\u8d85\u8d8a\u5168\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u9ad8\u964d\u4f4e87%\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u970050%\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u9006\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u523b\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "CFO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u7684PDE\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Neural ODE\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

Safe sets are computed by optimizing Lyapunov functions through an original iterative Sum-of-Squares (SOS) procedure. The method is first demonstrated on a two-state benchmark, where it accurately recovers a prescribed safe region as the 1-level set of a polynomial Lyapunov function. We then describe the distinguishing characteristics of the studied vehicle-with-driver system: the control dynamics mimic human driver behavior through a delayed preview-tracking model that, with suitable parameter choices, can also emulate digital controllers. To enable SOS optimization, a polynomial approximation of the nonlinear vehicle model is derived, together with its operating-envelope constraints. The framework is then applied to understeering and oversteering scenarios, and the estimated safe sets are compared with reference boundaries obtained from exhaustive simulations. The results show that SOS techniques can efficiently deliver Lyapunov-defined safe regions, supporting their potential use for real-time safety assessment, for example as a supervisory layer for active vehicle control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3Sum-of-Squares\uff08SOS\uff09\u4f18\u5316Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e03\u7ef4\u4eba\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b50\u96c6\uff08\u5373\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\u5438\u5f15\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4fdd\u969c\u4eba\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9700\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6ee1\u8db3\u72b6\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u57df\uff08ROA\uff09\u5185\u5b89\u5168\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u6ede\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u521b\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3Sum-of-Squares\uff08SOS\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u591a\u9879\u5f0fLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u5305\u7edc\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u5b89\u5168\u4e0d\u53d8\u96c6\uff1b\u5148\u5728\u4e8c\u9636\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u518d\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u542b\u65f6\u6ede\u9884\u89c8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e03\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f66\u8f86\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e8c\u9636\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u6062\u590d\u9884\u8bbe\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u5728\u4e03\u9636\u8f66\u8f86\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u542bundersteer/oversteer\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u4e0e\u7a77\u4e3e\u4eff\u771f\u6240\u5f97\u53c2\u8003\u8fb9\u754c\u543b\u5408\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SOS\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SOS\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210Lyapunov\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5982\u4e3b\u52a8\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5c42\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, evaluation of rendering aesthetics, a growing domain relevant to photographic editing, content creation, and AI-generated imagery, remains underexplored due to the lack of datasets that reflect the inherently subjective nature of style preference. In this work, a novel benchmark dataset designed to model human aesthetic judgments of image rendering styles is introduced: the Dataset for Evaluating the Aesthetics of Rendering (DEAR). Built upon the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, DEAR incorporates pairwise human preference scores collected via large-scale crowdsourcing, with each image pair evaluated by 25 distinct human evaluators with a total of 13,648 of them participating overall. These annotations capture nuanced, context-sensitive aesthetic preferences, enabling the development and evaluation of models that go beyond traditional distortion-based IQA, focusing on a new task: Evaluation of Aesthetics of Rendering (EAR).

Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OntoAxiom\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8612\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e94\u7c7b\u672c\u4f53\u516c\u7406\uff08\u5982\u5b50\u7c7b\u3001\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u5f0f vs. \u9010\u6761\u5f0f\uff09\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9010\u6761\u63d0\u793a\u66f4\u4f18\u3001\u9886\u57df\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u867d\u672a\u8fbe\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u8f85\u52a9\u672c\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u516c\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u903b\u8f91\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5176\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4ecd\u662f\u96be\u70b9\uff1b\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765LLM\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u672c\u4f53\u516c\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b9\u4e2a\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u672c\u4f53\u3001\u51712771\u6761\u516c\u7406\u7684OntoAxiom\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5728 subclass\u3001disjoint\u3001subproperty\u3001domain\u3001range \u4e94\u7c7b\u516c\u7406\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd412\u79cdLLM\u30013\u79cd\u793a\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\uff08zero/one/few-shot\uff09\u53ca\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08Direct vs. Axiom-by-Axiom\uff09\u3002", "result": "Axiom-by-Axiom\uff08AbA\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565F1\u5f97\u5206\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8eDirect\uff1b\u516c\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff08\u5982FOAF\u5b50\u7c7b\u516c\u7406F1=0.642\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u672c\u4f53\u4ec50.218\uff09\uff1b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u4f18\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4ecd\u5177\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5c1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5019\u9009\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8f85\u52a9\u672c\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5f00\u5c55\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}}

While AI-feedback-based self-improving alignment methods have been explored as a scalable alternative, they have largely remained constrained to conventional alignment values. In this work, we explore both a more holistic alignment objective and a scalable, self-improving alignment approach. Aiming to transcend conventional alignment norms, we introduce Collective Agency (CA)-a unified and open-ended alignment value that encourages integrated agentic capabilities. We also propose Dynamic Alignment-an alignment framework that enables an LLM to iteratively align itself. Dynamic Alignment comprises two key components: (1) automated training dataset generation with LLMs, and (2) a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own output candidates and assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning.

We introduce the Image and Event to Video (IE2Video) task: reconstructing RGB video sequences from a single initial frame and subsequent event camera data. We investigate two architectural strategies: adapting an autoregressive model (HyperE2VID) for RGB generation, and injecting event representations into a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model (LTX) via learned encoders and low-rank adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that the diffusion-based approach achieves 33\\% better perceptual quality than the autoregressive baseline (0.283 vs 0.422 LPIPS).

Recent advances in Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms for solving (W)PMS have mainly focused on designing clause weighting schemes. However, existing methods often fail to adequately distinguish between PMS and WPMS, typically employing uniform update strategies for clause weights and overlooking critical structural differences between the two problem types. In this work, we present a novel clause weighting scheme that, for the first time, updates the clause weights of PMS and WPMS instances according to distinct conditions. This scheme also introduces a new initialization method, which better accommodates the unique characteristics of both instance types. Furthermore, we propose a decimation method that prioritizes satisfying unit and hard clauses, effectively complementing our proposed clause weighting scheme. Building on these methods, we develop a new SLS solver for (W)PMS named DeepDist. Experimental results on benchmarks from the anytime tracks of recent MaxSAT Evaluations show that DeepDist outperforms state-of-the-art SLS solvers. Notably, a hybrid solver combining DeepDist with TT-Open-WBO-Inc surpasses the performance of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2024 winners, SPB-MaxSAT-c-Band and SPB-MaxSAT-c-FPS, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

While detecting LLM-generated text has been extensively studied, distinguishing human vs LLM-generated scientific idea remains an unexplored area. In this work, we systematically evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models to differentiate between human and LLM-generated ideas, particularly after successive paraphrasing stages. Our findings highlight the challenges SOTA models face in source attribution, with detection performance declining by an average of 25.4\\% after five consecutive paraphrasing stages. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the research problem as contextual information improves detection performance by up to 2.97%. Notably, our analysis reveals that detection algorithms struggle significantly when ideas are paraphrased into a simplified, non-expert style, contributing the most to the erosion of distinguishable LLM signatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79d1\u7814\u60f3\u6cd5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6b21\u6539\u5199\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d25.4%\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u52a0\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53ef\u5c0f\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u6700\u9ad8+2.97%\uff09\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u6539\u5199\u4e3a\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b80\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u7279\u5f81\u6700\u6613\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6700\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79d1\u7814\u4ee3\u7406\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u533a\u5206LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79d1\u7814\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c1a\u65e0\u5de5\u4f5c\u63a2\u7d22\u79d1\u5b66\u60f3\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4bSOTA\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u79d1\u7814\u60f3\u6cd5\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u591a\u8f6e\u6539\u5199\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e94\u8f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6539\u5199\u540e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d25.4%\uff1b\u52a0\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u53472.97%\uff1b\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b80\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6539\u5199\u5bf9LLM\u7279\u5f81\u7834\u574f\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4e0a\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u5f52\u56e0\u79d1\u7814\u60f3\u6cd5\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u4f46\u98ce\u683c\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6539\u5199\u4e0b\uff1b\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u9700\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5efa\u6a21\u79d1\u5b66\u601d\u7ef4\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

We address this by optimizing the behavior model that controls individual traffic participants. To improve efficiency, we adopt an instance-centric scene representation, where each traffic participant and map element is modeled in its own local coordinate frame. This design enables efficient, viewpoint-invariant scene encoding and allows static map tokens to be reused across simulation steps. To model interactions, we employ a query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings between local frames. We use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to learn the behavior model and propose an adaptive reward transformation that automatically balances robustness and realism during training.

Addressing these gaps requires benchmarks that are natively authored to reflect local norms and harm scenarios. We introduce SEA-SafeguardBench, the first human-verified safety benchmark for SEA, covering eight languages, 21,640 samples, across three subsets: general, in-the-wild, and content generation. The experimental results from our benchmark demonstrate that even state-of-the-art LLMs and guardrails are challenged by SEA cultural and harm scenarios and underperform when compared to English texts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\uff08SEA\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6SEA-SafeguardBench\uff0c\u6db5\u76d68\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u300121640\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\u6587\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u5f31\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u82f1\u8bed\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9ad8\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u72ec\u7279\uff08\u5982\u653f\u6cbb\u8a00\u8bba\u3001\u672c\u5730\u5316\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u751f\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6SEA-SafeguardBench\uff0c\u8986\u76d68\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u300121640\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08in-the-wild\uff09\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u4e0e\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u548cguardrail\u6a21\u578b\u5728SEA\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u7279\u6709\u5371\u5bb3\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u77ed\u677f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u91cd\u89c6\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u5efa\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u539f\u751f\u8bed\u5883\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u5371\u5bb3\u5efa\u6a21\uff0cSEA-SafeguardBench\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8\u516c\u5e73\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u6587\u5316\u9002\u914d\u7684AI\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002"}}

This paper addresses this challenge by introducing AionHMR, a comprehensive framework designed to bridge this domain gap. We propose an optimization-based method that extends a top-performing model by incorporating the SMPL-A body model, enabling the concurrent and accurate modeling of adults, children, and infants. Leveraging this approach, we generated pseudo-ground-truth annotations for publicly available child and infant image databases. Using these new training data, we then developed and trained a specialized transformer-based deep learning model capable of real-time 3D age-inclusive human reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly improve shape and pose estimation for children and infants without compromising accuracy on adults. Importantly, our reconstructed meshes serve as privacy-preserving substitutes for raw images, retaining essential action, pose, and geometry information while enabling anonymized datasets release. As a demonstration, we introduce the 3D-BabyRobot dataset, a collection of action-preserving 3D reconstructions of children interacting with robots.

Unlike existing models that rely solely on a series of snapshots of the limit order book, KANFormer integrates the actions of agents related to LOB dynamics and the position of the order in the queue to more effectively capture patterns related to execution likelihood. We evaluate the model using CAC 40 index futures data with labeled orders. The results show that KANFormer outperforms existing works in both calibration (Right-Censored Log-Likelihood, Integrated Brier Score) and discrimination (C-index, time-dependent AUC).

The proposed framework formulates an optimization problem that takes a construction mission divided into sub-tasks and a team of autonomous UAVs, along with limited volume and battery. It generates an optimal mission plan comprising task assignments and scheduling while accounting for task dependencies arising from the geometric and structural requirements of the 3D design, inter-UAV safety constraints, material usage, and total flight time of each UAV. The potential conflicts occurring during the simultaneous operation of the UAVs are addressed at a segment level by dynamically selecting the starting time and location of each task to guarantee collision-free parallel execution. An importance prioritization is proposed to accelerate the computation by guiding the solution toward more important tasks. Additionally, a utility maximization formulation is proposed to dynamically determine the optimal number of UAVs required for a given mission, balancing the trade-off between minimizing makespan and the deployment of excess agents. The proposed framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a Gazebo-based simulation setup, where agents are coordinated by a mission control module allocating the printing tasks based on the generated optimal scheduling plan while remaining within the material and battery constraints of each UAV.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u4e2d3D\u6253\u5370\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u53caUAV\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u907f\u78b0\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u4f5c\u4e1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u7a7a\u4e2d3D\u6253\u5370\u4e2d\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u7535\u6c60\u3001\u6750\u6599\uff09\u53d7\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6548\u534f\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7efc\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u53caUAV\u6570\u91cf\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Gazebo\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51b2\u7a81-free\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6253\u5370\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001UAV\u6570\u91cf\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u591aUAV\u5b8c\u6210\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u4e2d3D\u6253\u5370\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6574\u4f53\u5de5\u671f\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

We compared three supervised transformer-based encoders (BioClinicalModernBERT, ModernBERT, Clinical Longformer) against four generative LLM configurations (Llama 3.1-8B, GPT-4o, GPT-OSS-20b). We introduced a novel inference strategy using lesion-tagged inputs and anatomy-aware prompting to ground model reasoning. Performance was evaluated using class-specific F1-scores.\n  Results: The anatomy-informed GPT-OSS-20b model achieved the highest performance, yielding an incidentaloma-positive macro-F1 of 0.79. This surpassed all supervised baselines (maximum macro-F1: 0.70) and closely matched the inter-annotator agreement of 0.76. Explicit anatomical grounding yielded statistically significant performance gains across GPT-based models (p < 0.05), while a majority-vote ensemble of the top systems further improved the macro-F1 to 0.90. Error analysis revealed that anatomy-aware LLMs demonstrated superior contextual reasoning in distinguishing actionable findings from benign lesions.\n  Conclusion: Generative LLMs, when enhanced with structured lesion tagging and anatomical context, significantly outperform traditional supervised encoders and achieve performance comparable to human experts.

However, most approaches assume independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise, while real-world sensors often exhibit spatially correlated noise due to readout mechanisms, limiting their practical effectiveness. We introduce Correlation Aware Restoration with Diffusion (CARD), a training-free extension of DDRM that explicitly handles correlated Gaussian noise. CARD first whitens the noisy observation, which converts the noise into an i.i.d. form. Then, the diffusion restoration steps are replaced with noise-whitened updates, which inherits DDRM's closed-form sampling efficiency while now being able to handle correlated noise. To emphasize the importance of addressing correlated noise, we contribute CIN-D, a novel correlated noise dataset captured across diverse illumination conditions to evaluate restoration methods on real rolling-shutter sensor noise. This dataset fills a critical gap in the literature for experimental evaluation with real-world correlated noise. Experiments on standard benchmarks with synthetic correlated noise and on CIN-D demonstrate that CARD consistently outperforms existing methods across denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCARD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u767d\u5316\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u767d\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6eda\u52a8\u5feb\u95e8\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6CIN-D\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u566a\u58f0\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982\u6eda\u52a8\u5feb\u95e8\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "CARD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684DDRM\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u542b\u566a\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u767d\u5316\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u8f6c\u4e3ai.i.d.\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6062\u590d\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u767d\u5316\u540e\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u95ed\u5f0f\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u81ea\u5efa\u771f\u5b9e\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6CIN-D\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCARD\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u3001\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u539f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1bCARD\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3002"}}

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86NVIDIA\u7684FourCastNetv2\uff08FCNv2\uff09\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5bf9\u98d3\u98ce\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eFCNv2\u5728\u4f4e\u81f3\u4e2d\u7b49\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u98d3\u98ce\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f4e\u4f30\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u9762\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u8f93\u5165\u4ecd\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u5176\u5185\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982FCNv2\uff09\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u98d3\u98ce\uff09\u9884\u62a5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u4e24\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a1\uff09\u5728ERA5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u98d3\u98ceFlorence\u521d\u59cb\u573a\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u542f\u52a8FCNv2\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u975e\u7269\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "FCNv2\u5728\u4f4e\u81f3\u4e2d\u7b49\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4fdd\u6301\u98d3\u98ce\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7ef4\u6301\u5927\u81f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4f46\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u5747\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f4e\u4f30\u98ce\u66b4\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\u5168\u968f\u673a\u521d\u503c\u4e0b\u6570\u6b65\u540e\u5373\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "FCNv2\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8AI\u6c14\u8c61\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

The model uses physically based rendering (PBR) in the near-infrared domain. It assumes single-bounce reflections and retroreflections over rasterized rendered images from shading or ray tracing, including light emitted from the sensor as well as stray light from other, non-correlated sources such as sunlight. Beams from the sensor and sensitivity of the receiving diodes are modeled with flexible beam steering patterns and with non-vanishing diameter.\n  Different (all non-real time) computational approaches can be chosen based on system properties, computing capabilities, and desired output properties.\n  Model parameters include system-specific properties, namely the physical spread of the LiDAR beam, combined with the sensitivity of the receiving diode; the intensity of the emitted light; the conversion between the intensity of reflected light and the echo pulse width; and scenario parameters such as environment lighting, positioning, and surface properties of the target(s) in the relevant infrared domain. System-specific properties of the model are determined from laboratory measurements of the photometric luminance on different target surfaces aligned with a goniometer at 0.01\u00b0 resolution, which marks the best available resolution for measuring the beam pattern.\n  The approach is calibrated for and tested on two automotive LiDAR systems, the Valeo Scala Gen. 2 and the Blickfeld Cube 1. Both systems differ notably in their properties and available interfaces, but the relevant model parameters could be extracted successfully.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u6c7d\u8f66\u7ea7\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08ToF\uff09LiDAR\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5149\u6655\uff08blooming\uff09\u3001\u56de\u6ce2\u8109\u5bbd\u3001\u73af\u5883\u5149\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6807\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u57df\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6e32\u67d3\uff08PBR\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u6b21\u53cd\u5c04\u4e0e\u9006\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6\uff09\u3002\u5df2\u5728Valeo Scala Gen.2\u548cBlickfeld Cube 1\u4e24\u6b3e\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5546\u7528LiDAR\u4e0a\u5b8c\u6210\u6807\u5b9a\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LiDAR\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u5b9e\u9645\u5149\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5982blooming\u3001\u8109\u5bbd\u5c55\u5bbd\u3001\u73af\u5883\u5149\u5e72\u6270\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u57df\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u53d1\u5c04/\u63a5\u6536\u5149\u675f\u7279\u6027\uff08\u542b\u975e\u96f6\u76f4\u5f84\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u626b\u63cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u3001\u5355\u6b21/\u9006\u5411\u53cd\u5c04\u3001\u73af\u5883\u5149\uff08\u5982\u9633\u5149\uff09\u53cablooming\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff080.01\u00b0\uff09goniometer\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u91cf\u83b7\u53d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u5149\u675f\u53d1\u6563\u89d2\u3001\u63a5\u6536\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u5149\u5f3a-\u8109\u5bbd\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u4e3aValeo Scala Gen.2\u548cBlickfeld Cube 1\u4e24\u6b3e\u5f02\u6784LiDAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u6210\u53c2\u6570\u6807\u5b9a\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u590d\u73b0\u6c7d\u8f66LiDAR\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5149\u5b66\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u6d41\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3aLiDAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Owing to computational and token-cost constraints, we evaluate a curated set of 100 representative problems across multiple large language models (LLMs), including GPT-OSS and LLaMA variants, under standard prompting, CoT, and ToT strategies. Our results show that CoT improves baseline accuracy from 78% (standard prompting) to 83% on average, while ToT further increases performance by up to 5 percentage points, achieving 88% accuracy with GPT-OSS-120B. These improvements highlight that ToT is particularly effective in medium-to-large-scale models but may offer less advantage for smaller ones. Overall, our findings establish ToT as a robust framework for solving mathematical problems in low-resource languages such as Bengali. More broadly, this study shows that structured reasoning methods like ToT can provide more reliable and globally consistent outcomes than CoT, paving the way for better reasoning strategies in multilingual NLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning for solving Bengali Mathematical Word Problems (MWPs), showing ToT outperforms Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and standard prompting, especially in larger LLMs, achieving up to 88% accuracy on the SOMADHAN dataset.", "motivation": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting suffers from error propagation due to its linear structure, limiting effectiveness on MWPs; there's a need for more robust reasoning methods\u2014especially for low-resource languages like Bengali.", "method": "The authors conduct a systematic evaluation of Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning on 100 representative Bengali MWPs from the SOMADHAN dataset, comparing it with standard prompting and CoT across multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-OSS, LLaMA variants), under computational and token-cost constraints.", "result": "CoT improves baseline accuracy from 78% to 83%; ToT further boosts accuracy by up to 5 percentage points (reaching 88% with GPT-OSS-120B); gains are more pronounced in medium-to-large models than smaller ones.", "conclusion": "Tree-of-Thought is a robust, effective framework for mathematical reasoning in low-resource languages like Bengali, offering more reliable and globally consistent outcomes than CoT\u2014and paving the way for improved structured reasoning in multilingual NLP."}}

Capturing their 4-dimensional structures, composition and spatio-temporal configuration in-the-wild, though extremely interesting, is equally hard. Therefore, existing works often focus on one object at a time, while relying on some category-specific parametric shape model for dynamic objects. This can lead to inconsistent scene configurations, in addition to being limited to the modeled object categories. We propose COM4D (Compositional 4D), a method that consistently and jointly predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects using only static multi-object or dynamic single object supervision. We achieve this by a carefully designed training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input. The training is disentangled into learning from object compositions on the one hand, and single object dynamics throughout the video on the other, thus completely avoiding reliance on 4D compositional training data. At inference time, our proposed attention mixing mechanism combines these independently learned attentions, without requiring any 4D composition examples. By alternating between spatial and temporal reasoning, COM4D reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects directly from monocular videos. Furthermore, COM4D provides state-of-the-art results in existing separate problems of 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven.", "AI": {"tldr": "COM4D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u97004D\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u636e\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u5373\u53ef\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u7269\u4f534D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76844D/3D\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u6bcf\u6b21\u53ea\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u573a\u666f\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff1b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u7269\u4f534D\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCOM4D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u7ec4\u6210\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u7269\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\uff1b\u5168\u7a0b\u4ec5\u9700\u9759\u6001\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u6216\u52a8\u6001\u5355\u7269\u4f53\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u65e0\u97004D\u7ec4\u5408\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f4D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6301\u4e45\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u57284D\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "COM4D\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f4D\u7ec4\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u7269\u4f534D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u75284D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) show substantial specific skills for a wide array of downstream tasks, they more or less fall shorts in general intelligence. Following correlation between intelligence and system 2 reasoning (slow thinking), in this paper, we aim to answering a worthwhile research question: could machine intelligence such as LLMs be evolved to acquire reasoning ability (not specific skill) just like our human beings? To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual.

Stich"], "title": "Non-Convex Federated Optimization under Cost-Aware Client Selection", "comment": null, "summary": "Different federated optimization algorithms typically employ distinct client-selection strategies: some methods communicate only with a randomly sampled subset of clients at each round, while others need to periodically communicate with all clients or use a hybrid scheme that combines both strategies. However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbSAGA\uff08RG-SAGA\uff09\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u672a\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u663e\u5f0f\u523b\u753b\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8einexact composite gradient method\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5f15\u5165Recursive-Gradient\uff08RG\uff09\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdbSAGA\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5f97\u5230RG-SAGA\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u5176\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eRG-SAGA\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbSAGA\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff1bRG\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u6761\u4ef6\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08\u5982SVRG\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To robustly ground this correspondence-oriented task representation into actions, we design a conditional policy with a spatio-temporal attention mechanism that effectively fuses information across multiple input modalities.

The resource comprises 1 million decisions, featuring and high-quality raw text extracted from PDFs. It is released with raw extracted text in Markdown format, alongside a fully reproducible extraction pipeline. Beyond the core dataset, we conduct qualitative analyses to explore boilerplate patterns and design a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) task by formulating a set of representative questions, creating high-quality answers, and evaluating a baseline RAG system on its ability to retrieve and reason over public decisions. This evaluation demonstrates the potential of large-scale public-sector corpora to support advanced information access and transparency through structured retrieval and reasoning over governmental documents, and highlights how such a RAG pipeline could simulate a chat-based assistant capable of interactively answering questions about public decisions. Due to its scale, quality, and domain coverage, the corpus can also serve as high-value pre-training or fine-tuning material for new Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) respectively, including specialized models for legal and governmental domains, and as a foundation for novel approaches in domain adaptation, knowledge-grounded generation, and explainable AI.

Prior work has introduced datasets and benchmarks aimed at improving temporal reasoning, but these have emphasized other video content, including sports, cooking, and movies. No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD.

We argue this conclusion misidentifies the bottleneck: it confuses the ocean with the net. Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while \"reasoning\" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory).

With the help of Large Language Models and their reasoning capabilities, existing systems are able to think and decompose an input question over multiple steps to analyze, retrieve, and reason. However, training-based approaches for this problem still suffer from LLM hallucinations and incorrect reasoning paths that hinder performance. Hence, we propose PATHFINDER, an approach that: (i) uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate training path traces, (ii) improves training data quality by filtering erroneous and lengthy traces using sub-answer recall and LLM-as-a-judge verification, and (iii) reformulates sub-queries to handle failed retrieval cases. By following these steps, we demonstrate that PATHFINDER improves the performance of multi-hop QA over public benchmark datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPATHFINDER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7b54\u6848\u53ec\u56de\u548cLLM\u8bc4\u5224\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9519\u8bef\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u5199\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u53d7\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u56f0\u6270\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5b50\u7b54\u6848\u53ec\u56de\u548cLLM-as-a-judge\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9519\u8bef\u53ca\u5197\u957f\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5199\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPATHFINDER\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PATHFINDER\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, they lack a grounded understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation arises from training VLMs on static internet-scale visual-language data that contain no causal interactions or action-conditioned changes. Consequently, it remains challenging to leverage VLMs for fine-grained robotic manipulation tasks that require physical understanding, reasoning, and corresponding action planning. To overcome this, we present SIMPACT, a test-time, SIMulation-enabled ACTion Planning framework that equips VLMs with physical reasoning through simulation-in-the-loop world modeling, without requiring any additional training. From a single RGB-D observation, SIMPACT efficiently constructs physics simulations, enabling the VLM to propose informed actions, observe simulated rollouts, and iteratively refine its reasoning. By integrating language reasoning with physics prediction, our simulation-enabled VLM can understand contact dynamics and action outcomes in a physically grounded way. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on five challenging, real-world rigid-body and deformable manipulation tasks that require fine-grained physical reasoning, outperforming existing general-purpose robotic manipulation models. Our results demonstrate that embedding physics understanding via efficient simulation into VLM reasoning at test time offers a promising path towards generalizable embodied intelligence.

Extensive quantitative evaluation and user studies demonstrate that SpaceControl outperforms both training-based and optimization-based baselines in geometric faithfulness while preserving high visual quality.

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models.

However, this inpainting method introduces computational overhead that increases inference latency. In this work, we propose a simple alternative: simulating inference delay at training time and conditioning on action prefixes directly, eliminating any inference-time overhead. Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $\u03c0_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper.

Code available at https://github.com/XD111ds/ILVR", "summary": "Interleaved reasoning paradigms enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual feedback but are hindered by the prohibitive computational cost of repeatedly re-encoding pixel-dense images. A promising alternative, latent visual reasoning, circumvents this bottleneck yet currently forces a critical trade-off: methods either sacrifice precise perceptual modeling by over-compressing features or fail to model dynamic problems due to static, non-interleaved structures. We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. To enable this, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a Momentum Teacher Model selectively distills relevant features from helper images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals.

However, estimating personalized networks typically requires intensive longitudinal data, which is not always feasible. A solution to facilitate scalability of network-driven treatment personalization is leveraging LLMs. In this study, we present an end-to-end pipeline for automatically generating client networks from 77 therapy transcripts to support case conceptualization and treatment planning. We annotated 3364 psychological processes and their corresponding dimensions in therapy transcripts. Using these data, we applied in-context learning to jointly identify psychological processes and their dimensions. The method achieved high performance even with a few training examples. To organize the processes into networks, we introduced a two-step method that grouped them into clinically meaningful clusters. We then generated explanation-augmented relationships between clusters. Experts found that networks produced by our multi-step approach outperformed those built with direct prompting for clinical utility and interpretability, with up to 90% preferring our approach. In addition, the networks were rated favorably by experts, with scores for clinical relevance, novelty, and usefulness ranging from 72-75%. Our findings provide a proof of concept for using LLMs to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts. Advantages of our approach include bottom-up case conceptualization from client utterances in therapy sessions and identification of latent themes. Networks generated from our pipeline may be used in clinical settings and supervision and training.

With powerful capabilities in personalized guidance, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to bridge this gap. However, current research focuses mainly on one-on-one knowledge instruction, overlooking collaborative reasoning, a key skill for students developed in teamwork like ward rounds. To this end, we develop ClinEdu, a multi-agent pedagogical simulator with personality-driven patients and diverse student cohorts, enabling controlled testing of complex pedagogical processes and scalable generation of teaching data. Based on ClinEdu, we construct ClinTeach, a large Socratic teaching dialogue dataset that captures the complexities of group instruction. We then train MedTutor-R1, the first multimodal Socratic tutor designed for one-to-many instruction in clinical medical education. MedTutor-R1 is first instruction-tuned on our ClinTeach dataset and then optimized with reinforcement learning, using rewards derived from a three-axis rubric, covering structural fidelity, analytical quality, and clinical safety, to refine its adaptive Socratic strategies.

Extended version", "summary": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm in RGB-T tracking, enabling downstream task adaptation by freezing pretrained parameters and fine-tuning only a small set of parameters. This set forms a rank space made up of multiple individual ranks, whose expressiveness directly shapes the model's adaptability. However, quantitative analysis reveals low-rank adaptation exhibits significant redundancy in the rank space, with many ranks contributing almost no practical information. This hinders the model's ability to learn more diverse knowledge to address the various challenges in RGB-T tracking. To address this issue, we propose the Group Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation (GOLA) framework for RGB-T tracking, which effectively leverages the rank space through structured parameter learning. Specifically, we adopt a rank decomposition partitioning strategy utilizing singular value decomposition to quantify rank importance, freeze crucial ranks to preserve the pretrained priors, and cluster the redundant ranks into groups to prepare for subsequent orthogonal constraints. We further design an inter-group orthogonal constraint strategy. This constraint enforces orthogonality between rank groups, compelling them to learn complementary features that target diverse challenges, thereby alleviating information redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLA effectively reduces parameter redundancy and enhances feature representation capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets and validating its effectiveness in RGB-T tracking tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGOLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7ec4\u6b63\u4ea4\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u51cf\u5c11RGB-T\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u4f4e\u79e9\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u79e9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RGB-T\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u79e9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u6837\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGroup Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation\uff08GOLA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u91c7\u7528SVD\u8fdb\u884c\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3\u5173\u952e\u79e9\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5197\u4f59\u79e9\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u7ec4\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5404\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "GOLA\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GOLA\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u79e9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5229\u7528\u548c\u7ec4\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RGB-T\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation upon which new research and knowledge are built. Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and the increasing demands on the peer-review system make such mistakes harder to detect and avoid. To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of frontier LLMs to detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping to establish a firmer foundation of knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-5\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u9876\u4f1a\u9876\u520aAI\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u63a8\u5bfc\u3001\u56fe\u8868\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd1\u5e74\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u4e0a\u5347\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u7bc7\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u4eceNeurIPS 2021\u5e74\u76843.8\u589e\u81f32025\u5e74\u76845.9\uff1b\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793aAI\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe83.2%\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u4e3a75.8%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7814\u7a76\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u538b\u529b\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u5ba2\u89c2\u9519\u8bef\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u53ca\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-5\u7684Paper Correctness Checker\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u63a8\u5bfc\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u8868\u683c\uff09\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff1b\u5728NeurIPS\u3001ICLR\u3001TMLR\u7b49\u9876\u4f1a\u9876\u520a\u8bba\u6587\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9AI\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u62bd\u6837\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd1\u5e74\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u5ba2\u89c2\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u91cf\u6301\u7eed\u4e0a\u5347\uff08\u5982NeurIPS\u5e73\u5747\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u589e\u957f55.3%\uff09\uff1bAI\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e3a83.2%\uff08263/316\u786e\u8ba4\u4e3a\u771f\u9519\u8bef\uff09\uff1bAI\u80fd\u4e3a75.8%\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u786e\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u9519\u8bef\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u5b66\u672f\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u5ba2\u89c2\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u7814\u6587\u732e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Yet, ensuring their reliability remains a critical challenge, as existing LLMs trained on massive heterogeneous datasets often exhibit problematic memorization of proprietary intellectual property (IP), contaminated benchmarks, and unsafe coding patterns. To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel unlearning framework tailored for LLM-based hardware code generation. Our method combines (i) a syntax-preserving unlearning strategy that safeguards the structural integrity of hardware code during forgetting, and (ii) a fine-grained floor-aware selective loss that enables precise and efficient removal of problematic knowledge.

Active learning automates the process of selecting which data to annotate, reducing the total amount of annotation needed to achieve satisfactory performance. Recent approaches to active learning for 3D point clouds are often based on sophisticated heuristics for both, splitting point clouds into annotatable regions and selecting the most beneficial for further neural network training. In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement strategy to separate the point cloud into annotatable regions. In our approach, we utilize a 2D grid to subdivide the point cloud into columns. To identify the next data to be annotated, we employ a network ensemble to estimate the uncertainty in the network output. We evaluate our method on the S3DIS dataset, the Toronto-3D dataset, and a large-scale urban 3D point cloud of the city of Freiburg, which we labeled in parts manually. The extensive evaluation shows that our method yields performance on par with, or even better than, complex state-of-the-art methods on all datasets. Furthermore, we provide results suggesting that in the context of point clouds the annotated area can be a more meaningful measure for active learning algorithms than the number of annotated points.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u75282D\u7f51\u683c\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u67f1\u72b6\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u5f85\u6807\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6807\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u9762\u79ef\u6bd4\u6807\u6ce8\u70b9\u6570\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u548c\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7b80\u6d01\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75282D\u7f51\u683c\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u5782\u76f4\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u67f1\u72b6\u53ef\u6807\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\u4f30\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5728S3DIS\u3001Toronto-3D\u53ca\u81ea\u5efa\u5f17\u8d56\u5821\u57ce\u5e02\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6807\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u9762\u79ef\u6bd4\u6807\u6ce8\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u66f4\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u6d01\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee5\u6807\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u9762\u79ef\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u4f4d\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We provide a comparison of two models in three different settings for Czech Constitutional Court decisions: (i) a large general-purpose embedder (OpenAI), (ii) a domain-specific BERT-trained from scratch on ~30,000 decisions using sliding windows and attention pooling. We propose a noise-aware evaluation including IDF-weighted keyword overlap as graded relevance, binarization via two thresholds (0.20 balanced, 0.28 strict), significance via paired bootstrap, and an nDCG diagnosis supported with qualitative analysis. Despite modest absolute nDCG (expected under noisy labels), the general OpenAI embedder decisively outperforms the domain pre-trained BERT in both settings at @10/@20/@100 across both thresholds; differences are statistically significant. Diagnostics attribute low absolutes to label drift and strong ideals rather than lack of utility.

In particular, current datasets tend to be static, lacking intermediate reasoning steps, robustness to variations, or mechanisms for verifying scientific correctness. To address these limitations, we introduce PRiSM, a synthetic, fully dynamic, and multimodal benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning via grounded Python code. PRiSM includes over 24,750 university-level physics and math problems, and it leverages our scalable agent-based pipeline, PrismAgent, to generate well-structured problem instances. Each problem contains dynamic textual and visual input, a generated figure, alongside rich structured outputs: executable Python code for ground truth generation and verification, and detailed step-by-step reasoning. The dynamic nature and Python-powered automated ground truth generation of our benchmark allow for fine-grained experimental auditing of multimodal VLMs, revealing failure modes, uncertainty behaviors, and limitations in scientific reasoning. To this end, we propose five targeted evaluation tasks covering generalization, symbolic program synthesis, perturbation robustness, reasoning correction, and ambiguity resolution. Through comprehensive evaluation of existing VLMs, we highlight their limitations and showcase how PRiSM enables deeper insights into their scientific reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPRiSM\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff08\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6267\u884cPython\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u542b24750\u9053\u9898\u53ca\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6PRiSM\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684PrismAgent\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u542b\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u53ef\u6267\u884cPython\u4ee3\u7801\u53ca\u5206\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5927\u5b66\u7ea7\u6570\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e94\u7c7b\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4fee\u6b63\u3001\u6b67\u4e49\u6d88\u89e3\uff09\u3002", "result": "PRiSM\u5305\u542b24,750+\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e3b\u6d41VLM\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "PRiSM\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bfc\u5411\u7684VLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faC3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b50\u5757\u7ea7\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6bcf\u5e27\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u70ed\u56fe\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u8fdd\u80cc\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faC3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u771f\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5f00\u9500\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u81f3RGB\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u70ed\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728Bridge\u548cDROID\u7b49\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cC3\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "C3\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The proposed methodology is based on the combination of elementary faithfulness metrics into a combined (fused) metric, for the purpose of improving the faithfulness of LLM outputs. The proposed strategy for metric fusion deploys a tree-based model to identify the importance of each metric, which is driven by the integration of human judgements evaluating the faithfulness of LLM responses. This fused metric is demonstrated to correlate more strongly with human judgements across all tested domains for faithfulness. Improving the ability to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs, allows for greater confidence to be placed within models, allowing for their implementation in a greater diversity of scenarios.

Although attention-based pruning methods are widely used to accelerate inference, trials at early decoder layers often result in significant performance degradation, especially under high compression rates. We argue that while attention-based pruning inherently holds the potential to identify the most relevant visual tokens, its effectiveness in shallow decoder layers is limited by factors such as positional encoding bias and insufficient information interaction. In this paper, we propose an improved attention-based pruning framework, termed ShaRP, that integrates segment-aware causal masking, positional debiasing, and token deduplication for enhanced token selection. It enables effective pruning at shallow layers while maintaining stable performance under high compression rates without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShaRP achieves competitive performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks, establishing a new paradigm for accelerating VLLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faShaRP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53bb\u504f\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u53bb\u91cd\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLLMs\uff09\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u56e0\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShaRP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53bb\u504f\uff08positional debiasing\uff09\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u53bb\u91cd\uff08token deduplication\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6d45\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u526a\u679d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cShaRP\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "ShaRP\u4e3aVLLM\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faConfounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u7b5b\u9009\u5173\u952e\u6587\u672ctoken\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6b63\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdd\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b63\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff08positivity\uff09\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u6781\u7aef\u503e\u5411\u5f97\u5206\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u589e\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCATR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u9009\u62e9\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u7684token\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8db3\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e0\u6df7\u6742\u6027\uff08unconfoundedness\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u6742\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5254\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u865a\u5047\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548cMIMIC-III\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCATR\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "CATR\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c42\u9762\u6b63\u6027\u8fdd\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7cbe\u7b80\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Conformal In-Context Learning (CICLe) has been proposed as a resource-efficient framework that integrates a lightweight base classifier with Conformal Prediction to guide LLM prompting by adaptively reducing the set of candidate classes. However, its broader applicability and efficiency benefits beyond a single domain have not yet been systematically explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of CICLe across diverse NLP classification benchmarks. The results show that CICLe consistently improves over its base classifier and outperforms few-shot prompting baselines when the sample size is sufficient for training the base classifier, and performs comparably in low-data regimes. In terms of efficiency, CICLe reduces the number of shots and prompt length by up to 34.45% and 25.16%, respectively, and enables the use of smaller models with competitive performance. CICLe is furthermore particularly advantageous for text classification tasks with high class imbalance.

Unlike human experts who primarily rely on key areas to arrive at a diagnosis, existing slide-level multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for pathology rely on heavy slide-level encoders that process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, resulting in excessive computational cost. In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner.

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, such as the Rainbow Deep Q-Network (DQN), improve scalability through prioritized replay and distributional heads, classical function approximators limit their representational power. We introduce Variational Quantum Rainbow DQN (VQR-DQN), which integrates ring-topology variational quantum circuits with Rainbow DQN to leverage quantum superposition and entanglement. We frame the human resource allocation problem (HRAP) as a Markov decision process (MDP) with combinatorial action spaces based on officer capabilities, event schedules, and transition times. On four HRAP benchmarks, VQR-DQN achieves 26.8% normalized makespan reduction versus random baselines and outperforms Double DQN and classical Rainbow DQN by 4.9-13.4%. These gains align with theoretical connections between circuit expressibility, entanglement, and policy quality, demonstrating the potential of quantum-enhanced DRL for large-scale resource allocation.

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08CorrDiff\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u5168\u7403\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CMA-GFS\u548cSFF\uff09\u7684\u7c97\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u63d0\u5347\u81f33km\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u5927\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u591a\u5c42\u5927\u6c14\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u578bCMA-MESO\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u662f\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684CorrDiff\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u8f93\u5165\u533a\u57df\uff08\u7ea620\u500d\uff09\u3001\u7eb3\u51656\u4e2a\u6c14\u538b\u5c42\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b\u4ee5CMA-GFS\u548cSFF\u768425km\u8f93\u51fa\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u56fd\u533a\u57df3km\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u7684MAE\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u6574\u4f53\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u533a\u57df\u6a21\u578bCMA-MESO\uff1b\u96f7\u8fbe\u7ec4\u5408\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4e2d\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5408\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u5927\u533a\u57df\u3001\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6c14\u8c61\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u533a\u57df\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance. [...] Results include a quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support the classification task based on changes in the training domain [...].\n  Download: synset.de/datasets/synset-signset-ger/background-effect", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u80cc\u666f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u5f62\u72b6\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u80cc\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3XAI\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SHAP\u3001GradCAM\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f4\u89c2\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5408\u6cd5\u4e0e\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u867d\u53ef\u63a7\u4f46\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f realism \u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u523b\u753b\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u516d\u4e2a\u4ec5\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u53d8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08SynSet-SignSet-GER\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u9694\u79bb\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u8ff0\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u57df\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u80cc\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u4f55\u65f6\u53ca\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53c2\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3aXAI\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u5f71\u54cdXAI\u89e3\u91ca\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing methods often rely on shallow cues (e.g., names or topics) to simulate authorial style, without robust evaluation. In this work, we present a training framework for style-conditioned story generation using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a custom multi-reward setup. The style reward is derived from a fine-tuned sentence transformer using authorship verification (AV) signals, combined with content and completeness scores to stabilize long-form narrative generation. We conduct experiments using fiction by Mark Twain, a prominent 19th-century American author, with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn serving as the reference style exemplar. Our 8B model outperforms larger baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4 in AV-style metrics, achieving a style score of 0.628 and competitive content quality. Results demonstrate the feasibility of agentic stylistic generation with moderate model size and task-specific training. While the output is clearly style-aligned, narrative completeness remains a challenge, indicating future work is needed to better model global coherence and story resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGroup Relative Policy Optimization\uff08GRPO\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u53e5\u5b50Transformer\u63d0\u53d6\u4f5c\u8005\u98ce\u683c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u9a6c\u514b\u00b7\u5410\u6e29\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-4o\u548cClaude Sonnet 4\uff0c\u4f46\u53d9\u4e8b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\uff08\u5982\u7279\u5b9a\u4f5c\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5065\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6d45\u5c42\u7ebf\u7d22\u6a21\u62df\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u91cd\u5956\u52b1\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08AV\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u53e5\u5b50Transformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u98ce\u683c\u5956\u52b1\uff1b2\uff09\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff1b3\uff09\u53d9\u4e8b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff1b\u4ee5\u300a\u54c8\u514b\u8d1d\u5229\u00b7\u8d39\u6069\u5386\u9669\u8bb0\u300b\u4e3a\u9a6c\u514b\u00b7\u5410\u6e29\u98ce\u683c\u8303\u672c\uff0c\u57288B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d08B\u6a21\u578b\u5728AV\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4o\u548cClaude Sonnet 4\uff0c\u98ce\u683c\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.628\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u98ce\u683c\u4e13\u9879\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u98ce\u683c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u98ce\u683c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u5c40\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u53d9\u4e8b\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To induce these properties, we propose two lightweight, backbone-agnostic regularizers: Local Correlation Regularization and Latent Masked Reconstruction.

Each problem is fully parameterized, supporting an effectively infinite range of input configurations, and is accompanied by structured, step-by-step reasoning and executable Python code that produces the ground-truth solution for any parameter set. The benchmark contains three question types: MC-Symbolic (multiple-choice with symbolic options), MC-Numerical (multiple-choice with numerical options), and free-form (open-ended responses).

By leveraging the dynamic, code-driven nature of the benchmark, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics in addition to standard accuracy: Consistency Score, Failure Rate, and Confusion Rate, that quantify variability and uncertainty across problem variants.

Our analysis reveals that the commonly used benchmarks do not reflect the true challenge of generalizing to novel targets. We also investigate whether large-scale self-supervised pretraining can bridge this generalization gap and we provide preliminary evidence of its potential.

Using the ConvoKit Supreme Court Corpus (2010-2019), we analyze 12,663 speech chunks from advocate-justice interactions to assess whether interruptions alter the meaning of an advocate's argument and whether interruptions toward female advocates exhibit more negative emotional valence. Semantic shifts are quantified using GloVe-based sentence embeddings, while sentiment is measured through lexicon-based analysis. We find that semantic similarity between pre- and post-interruption speech remains consistently high, suggesting that interruptions do not substantially alter argumentative content. However, interruptions directed at female advocates contain significantly higher levels of negative sentiment. These results deepen empirical understanding of gendered communication in elite institutional settings and demonstrate the value of computational linguistic methods for studying power, discourse, and equity in judicial proceedings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u7f8e\u56fd\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u53e3\u5934\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u6cd5\u5b98\u5bf9\u5f8b\u5e08\u7684\u6253\u65ad\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6253\u65ad\u867d\u672a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u5f8b\u5e08\u8bba\u70b9\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u5f8b\u5e08\u7684\u6253\u65ad\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u611f\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53f8\u6cd5\u8bdd\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u7f8e\u56fd\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u53e3\u5934\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u65ad\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f8b\u5e08\u53d1\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u8c03\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u53f8\u6cd5\u8bdd\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eConvoKit\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff082010\u20132019\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u679012,663\u4e2a\u5f8b\u5e08-\u6cd5\u5b98\u4e92\u52a8\u8bdd\u8bed\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b\u91c7\u7528GloVe\u53e5\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7528\u8bcd\u5178\u6cd5\u6d4b\u91cf\u60c5\u611f\u503e\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u6253\u65ad\u524d\u540e\u5f8b\u5e08\u53d1\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6253\u65ad\u672a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u8bba\u8bc1\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u5f8b\u5e08\u7684\u6253\u65ad\u542b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u611f\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7cbe\u82f1\u5236\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u522b\u5316\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u6790\u53f8\u6cd5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u6743\u529b\u3001\u8bdd\u8bed\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome this challenge by training motion estimators to filter dynamic objects and focus on the static background. However, their performance is largely limited by the availability of large-scale motion segmentation datasets, resulting in inaccurate segmentation and, therefore, inferior structural 3D understanding. In this work, we introduce the Dynamic Prior (\\ourmodel) to robustly identify dynamic objects without task-specific training, leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the fine-grained spatial segmentation capacity of SAM2. \\ourmodel can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art pipelines for camera pose optimization, depth reconstruction, and 4D trajectory estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world videos demonstrate that \\ourmodel not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on motion segmentation, but also significantly improves accuracy and robustness for structural 3D understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDynamic Prior\uff08\\ourmodel\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u548cSAM2\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e4D\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u53163D\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSfM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u30013D\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5272\u4e0d\u51c6\u30013D\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDynamic Prior\uff08\\ourmodel\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408Vision-Language Models\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eSAM2\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u4e3b\u6d413D/4D\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\\ourmodel\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u548c4D\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Dynamic Prior\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53163D\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This has led to the emergence of AI-driven information retrieval solutions, designed to adeptly extract relevant insights to address employee inquiries. These solutions often leverage pre-trained embedding models and generative models as foundational components. While pre-trained embeddings may exhibit proximity or disparity based on their original training objectives, they might not fully align with the unique characteristics of enterprise-specific data, leading to suboptimal alignment with the retrieval goals of enterprise environments. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive methodology for contextualizing pre-trained embedding models to enterprise environments, covering the entire process from data preparation to model fine-tuning and evaluation.

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations.

Nevertheless, LLM-driven generation remains challenging: the token-level design loop is discrete and non-differentiable, preventing feedback from smoothly guiding architectural improvement. These methods, in turn, commonly suffer from mode collapse into redundant structures or drift toward infeasible designs when constructive reasoning is not well grounded. We introduce RevoNAD, a reflective evolutionary orchestrator that effectively bridges LLM-based reasoning with feedback-aligned architectural search. First, RevoNAD presents a Multi-round Multi-expert Consensus to transfer isolated design rules into meaningful architectural clues. Then, Adaptive Reflective Exploration adjusts the degree of exploration leveraging reward variance; it explores when feedback is uncertain and refines when stability is reached. Finally, Pareto-guided Evolutionary Selection effectively promotes architectures that jointly optimize accuracy, efficiency, latency, confidence, and structural diversity. Across CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet16-120, COCO-5K, and Cityscape, RevoNAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In this paper, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based medical QA system that combines domain-specific knowledge retrieval with open-source LLMs to answer medical questions. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets (PubMedQA and MedMCQA) and show that retrieval augmentation yields measurable improvements in answer accuracy compared to using LLMs alone. Our fine-tuned LLaMA~2 model achieves 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, substantially improving over the 55.4% zero-shot baseline, while maintaining transparency by providing source references. We also detail the system design and fine-tuning methodology, demonstrating that grounding answers in retrieved evidence reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%.

Our system achieves precise branch detection and depth estimation using only stereo camera input, eliminating the need for expensive LiDAR sensors. Experimental evaluation demonstrates YOLO's superior performance over Mask R-CNN, achieving 82.0% mAPmask50-95 for branch segmentation. The integrated system accurately localizes branches within a 2 m operational range, with processing times under one second per frame. These results establish the feasibility of cost-effective autonomous pruning systems that enhance worker safety and operational efficiency in commercial forestry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u4e0eSGBM\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u4e3b\u677e\u6811\u4fee\u679d\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u53cc\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u679d\u6761\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35LiDAR\uff0cmAP\u8fbe82.0%\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u57282\u7c73\u5185\uff0c\u5355\u5e27\u5904\u7406<1\u79d2\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6797\u4e1a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u4fee\u679d\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u7a7a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u878d\u5408YOLO\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0eSemi-Global Block Matching\uff08SGBM\uff09\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cc\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u8f93\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u679d\u6761\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "YOLO\u5728\u679d\u6761\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523082.0% mAPmask50-95\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eMask R-CNN\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u57282\u7c73\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u679d\u6761\uff0c\u5355\u5e27\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4f4e\u4e8e1\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u53cc\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u4e3b\u4fee\u679d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u6797\u4e1a\u3002"}}

The pipeline applies type-specific preprocessing -- median imputation and standardization for numeric variables, effect coding for binary features, and mode imputation with low-dimensional embeddings for rare categorical attributes -- and initializes patient nodes with summary statistics, while retaining measurement values on edges to preserve \"who measured what and by how much\". In a retrospective, multi-center Chinese cohort (N = 648; 70/30 train-test split) drawn from three tertiary hospitals, Triplet-GCN consistently outperforms strong tabular baselines (KNN, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) across discrimination and balanced error metrics, yielding a more favorable sensitivity-specificity trade-off and improved overall utility for early warning.

We introduce M4-RAG, a massive-scale benchmark covering 42 languages and 56 regional dialects and registers, comprising over 80,000 culturally diverse image-question pairs for evaluating retrieval-augmented VQA across languages and modalities. To balance realism with reproducibility, we build a controlled retrieval environment containing millions of carefully curated multilingual documents relevant to the query domains, approximating real-world retrieval conditions while ensuring consistent experimentation. Our systematic evaluation reveals that although RAG consistently benefits smaller VLMs, it fails to scale to larger models and often even degrades their performance, exposing a critical mismatch between model size and current retrieval effectiveness.

Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects.

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting.

However, existing methods struggle to fully balance sufficient interaction and flexible implementation due to vast representation difference. Considering abundant and hierarchical information in VLM's layers from low-level details to high-level semantics, we propose \\textbf{ParaUni}. It extracts features from variants VLM's layers in a \\textbf{Para}llel way for comprehensive information interaction and retains a flexible separation architecture to enhance generation in \\textbf{Uni}fied multimodal model. Concretely, visual features from all VLM's layers are fed in parallel into a Layer Integration Module (LIM), which efficiently integrates fine-grained details and semantic abstractions and provides the fused representation as a condition to the diffusion model. To further enhance performance, we reveal that these hierarchical layers respond unequally to different rewards in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Crucially, we design a Layer-wise Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism (LDAM) to facilitate multiple reward improvements that aligns the hierarchical properties of these layers using RL. Extensive experiments show ParaUni leverages complementary multi-layer features to substantially improve generation quality and shows strong potential for multiple reward advances during RL stages.

However, designing more compact and efficient deformation schemes together with rate-distortion-optimized compression strategies for dynamic 3DGS representations remains an underexplored area. Prior methods either rely on space-time 4DGS with overspecified, short-lived Gaussian primitives or on canonical 3DGS with deformation that lacks explicit temporal control. To address this, we present TED-4DGS, a temporally activated and embedding-based deformation scheme for rate-distortion-optimized 4DGS compression that unifies the strengths of both families. TED-4DGS is built on a sparse anchor-based 3DGS representation. Each canonical anchor is assigned learnable temporal-activation parameters to specify its appearance and disappearance transitions over time, while a lightweight per-anchor temporal embedding queries a shared deformation bank to produce anchor-specific deformation. For rate-distortion compression, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR)-based hyperprior to model anchor attribute distributions, along with a channel-wise autoregressive model to capture intra-anchor correlations. With these novel elements, our scheme achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several real-world datasets.

The comparative performance of Quantum Machine Learning models with no symmetry equivariance, rotational and permutational equivariance, and graph embedded permutational equivariance is investigated.

Therefore, this paper introduces a NeuTucker decomposition model utilizing discretized data. Designed for continuous yet sparse three-dimensional wind field data, it constructs a low-rank Tucker decomposition model based on a Tucker neural network to capture the latent interactions within the three-dimensional wind field data. Therefore, two core ideas are proposed here: 1) Discretizing continuous input data to adapt to models like NeuTucF that require discrete data inputs. 2) Constructing a four-dimensional Tucker interaction tensor to represent all possible spatio-temporal interactions among different elevations and three-dimensional wind speeds.

While existing image stylization methods effectively transform visual appearance, they often overlook the emotional impact carried by styles. To bridge this gap, we introduce Affective Image Stylization (AIS), a task that applies artistic styles to evoke specific emotions while preserving content. We present EmoStyle, a framework designed to address key challenges in AIS, including the lack of training data and the emotion-style mapping. First, we construct EmoStyleSet, a content-emotion-stylized image triplet dataset derived from ArtEmis to support AIS. We then propose an Emotion-Content Reasoner that adaptively integrates emotional cues with content to learn coherent style queries. Given the discrete nature of artistic styles, we further develop a Style Quantizer that converts continuous style features into emotion-related codebook entries.

However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions.

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift. An ablation over ensemble size further demonstrates that CDEC attains stable uncertainty estimates with only a small ensemble.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CDEC\u548cIDEC\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u4e3b\u52a8\u62d2\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u662fAI\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5bf9\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u53ca\u53ef\u9760\u62d2\u8bc6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCredal Deep Evidential Classification\uff08CDEC\uff09\u548cInterval Deep Evidential Classification\uff08IDEC\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u96c6\uff08credal set\uff09\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u3001CIFAR-10/100\u53ca\u5176\u81ea\u7136\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCDEC\u548cIDEC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u603b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7d27\u81f4\u4e14\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCDEC\u4ec5\u9700\u5c0f\u96c6\u6210\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "CDEC\u548cIDEC\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Code: https://github.com/mm1129/concept_based_rare_detector_2025", "summary": "Rare-object detection remains a challenging task in autonomous driving systems, particularly when relying solely on point cloud data. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in image understanding, their potential to enhance 3D object detection through intelligent data mining has not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel cross-modal framework that leverages 2D VLMs to identify and mine rare objects from driving scenes, thereby improving 3D object detection performance. Our approach synthesizes complementary techniques such as object detection, semantic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multi-faceted outlier detection into a cohesive, explainable pipeline that systematically identifies rare but critical objects in driving scenes. By combining Isolation Forest and t-SNE-based outlier detection methods with concept-based filtering, the framework effectively identifies semantically meaningful rare objects. A key strength of this approach lies in its ability to extract and annotate targeted rare object concepts such as construction vehicles, motorcycles, and barriers. This substantially reduces the annotation burden and focuses only on the most valuable training samples. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that this concept-guided data mining strategy enhances the performance of 3D object detection models while utilizing only a fraction of the training data, with particularly notable improvements for challenging object categories such as trailers and bicycles compared with the same amount of random data. This finding has substantial implications for the efficient curation of datasets in safety-critical autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u75282D\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4ece\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u6316\u6398\u7a00\u6709\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b64\u7acb\u68ee\u6797\u3001t-SNE\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a00\u6709\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347nuScenes\u4e0a3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u62d6\u8f66\u3001\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u7b49\u96be\u68c0\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u6709\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709VLM\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u57283D\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e2D VLM\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u964d\u7ef4\uff08t-SNE\uff09\u4e0e\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08Isolation Forest + \u6982\u5ff5\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff09\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a00\u6709\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u63d0\u53473D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u62d6\u8f66\u3001\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u7b49\u7c7b\u522b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6807\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u7a00\u6709\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u65bd\u5de5\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u6469\u6258\u8f66\u3001\u8def\u969c\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The superiority of $\\mathcal{IDK}$-$\\mathcal{S}$ is attributed to two key innovations. First, it inherits the strengths of the Isolation Distributional Kernel, an offline detector that has demonstrated significant performance advantages over foundational methods like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor due to the use of a data-dependent kernel.

While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faActive Video Perception (AVP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff08LVU\uff09\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e14\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u53d7\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4e3b\u5f20LVU\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u4e3b\u52a8\u51b3\u5b9a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u636e\u5145\u5206\u6027\u3002", "method": "AVP\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u91c7\u7528MLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u2018\u89c4\u5212-\u89c2\u5bdf-\u53cd\u601d\u2019\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u9891\u4ea4\u4e92\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5668\u6267\u884c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u5e26\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u53cd\u601d\u5668\u5224\u65ad\u8bc1\u636e\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u4ee5\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u7ec8\u6b62\u6216\u7ee7\u7eed\u89c2\u5bdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2aLVU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAVP\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53475.7%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u970018.4%\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c12.4%\u7684\u8f93\u5165token\u3002", "conclusion": "AVP\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4f4etoken\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4e3aLVU\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this case, most existing video underwater enhancement methods are performed by directly applying the single-image enhancement model frame by frame, but a natural issue is lacking temporal consistency. To relieve the problem, we rethink the temporal manifold inherent in natural videos and observe a temporal consistency prior in dynamic scenes from the local temporal frequency perspective. Building upon the specific prior and no paired-data condition, we propose an implicit representation manner for enhanced video signals, which is conducted in the wavelet-based temporal consistency field, WaterWave. Specifically, under the constraints of the prior, we progressively filter and attenuate the inconsistent components while preserving motion details and scenes, achieving a natural-flowing video. Furthermore, to represent temporal frequency bands more accurately, an underwater flow correction module is designed to rectify estimated flows considering the transmission in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterWave significantly enhances the quality of videos generated using single-image underwater enhancements.

First, the Adaptive Cross-Fusion Attention (ACFA) module integrates channel feature enhancement with spatial attention mechanisms and introduces learnable guidance in three directions (planar, horizontal, and vertical) to enhance responsiveness to key regions and structural orientations. Second, the Triple Feature Fusion Attention (TFFA) module fuses features from Spatial, Fourier and Wavelet domains, achieving joint frequency-spatial representation that strengthens global dependency and structural modeling while preserving local information such as edges and textures, making it particularly effective in complex and blurred boundary scenarios. Finally, the Structural-aware Multi-scale Masking Module (SMMM) optimizes the skip connections between encoder and decoder by leveraging multi-scale context and structural saliency filtering, effectively reducing feature redundancy and improving semantic interaction quality. Working synergistically, these modules not only address the shortcomings of traditional decoders but also significantly enhance performance in high-precision tasks such as tumor segmentation and organ boundary extraction, improving both segmentation accuracy and model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework provides an efficient and practical solution for medical image segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ea4\u53c9\u878d\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08ACFA\uff09\u3001\u4e09\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08TFFA\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63a9\u7801\uff08SMMM\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8fb9\u7f18\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u53ca\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542bACFA\uff08\u878d\u5408\u901a\u9053\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u3001TFFA\uff08\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u548c\u5c0f\u6ce2\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u548cSMMM\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f18\u5316\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5668\u5b98\u8fb9\u754c\u63d0\u53d6\u7b49\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent approaches consider a representation of local neighborhood in each view independently, and then capture the consistent neighbors across all views via a learning process. They suffer from two key issues. First, there is no guarantee that they can capture consistent neighbors well, especially when the same neighbors are in regions of varied densities in different views, resulting in inferior detection accuracy. Second, the learning process has a high computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, rendering them inapplicable for large datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed \\textbf{S}pherical \\textbf{C}onsistent \\textbf{N}eighborhoods \\textbf{E}nsemble (SCoNE). It has two unique features: (a) the consistent neighborhoods are represented with multi-view instances directly, requiring no intermediate representations as used in existing approaches; and (b) the neighborhoods have data-dependent properties, which lead to large neighborhoods in sparse regions and small neighborhoods in dense regions. The data-dependent properties enable local neighborhoods in different views to be represented well as consistent neighborhoods, without learning. This leads to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ time complexity.

To fill this gap, we systematically introduce the frozen representations from VFMs into the SIRST task for the first time and propose a Foundation-Driven Efficient Paradigm (FDEP), which can seamlessly adapt to existing encoder-decoder-based methods and significantly improve accuracy without additional inference overhead. Specifically, a Semantic Alignment Modulation Fusion (SAMF) module is designed to achieve dynamic alignment and deep fusion of the global semantic priors from VFMs with task-specific features. Meanwhile, to avoid the inference time burden introduced by VFMs, we propose a Collaborative Optimization-based Implicit Self-Distillation (CO-ISD) strategy, which enables implicit semantic transfer between the main and lightweight branches through parameter sharing and synchronized backpropagation. In addition, to unify the fragmented evaluation system, we construct a Holistic SIRST Evaluation (HSE) metric that performs multi-threshold integral evaluation at both pixel-level confidence and target-level robustness, providing a stable and comprehensive basis for fair model comparison. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SIRST detection networks equipped with our FDEP framework achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets.

Yet despite evidence that LLMs exhibit complementary strengths across tasks, traditionally best-of-$n$ relies on a single model to generate responses. We propose RoBoN (Routed Online Best-of-$n$), a sequential multi-LLM alternative to the prevailing single-model best-of-$n$. Given a suite of models $\\{m_i\\}_{i=1}^M$, RoBoN sequentially routes generations one-by-one across models, based on scores computed using a reward model and an agreement signal on the predicted responses. This online routing requires no additional training, keeps compute parity, and works with any plug-in reward model. Across reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, OlympiadBench, MinervaMath, GSM8K, MMLU), RoBoN consistently outperforms standard best-of-$n$ applied to each individual model for larger $n$, with gains of up to 3.4\\% in absolute accuracy, and also improves over a uniform multi-model portfolio baseline.

Know-Show unifies reasoning and localization within a single evaluation framework consisting of five complementary scenarios across spatial (person, object, person-object, and hand-object) and temporal dimensions. Built from Charades, Action Genome, and Ego4D with 2.5K human-authored questions, the benchmark exposes significant gaps between current Video-LMs and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose GRAM, a training-free plug-in that augments Video-LMs with fine-grained grounding through attention-based video token selection and explicit timestamp encoding. Extensive experiments across open and closed Video-LMs (Qwen, VideoLLaVA, GPT-4o, and Gemini, etc.) reveal that existing models struggle to \"show what they know\" and vice versa, especially in fine-grained hand-object interactions.

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths.

However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques.

First, while these models rely on attention-based learnable queries as a core component, these learnable queries are semantically uninformed and instance-agnostically initialized.

We propose depth-guided surgical scene segmentation (DepSeg), a training-free framework that utilizes monocular depth as a geometric prior together with pretrained vision foundation models. DepSeg first estimates a relative depth map with a pretrained monocular depth estimation network and proposes depth-guided point prompts, which SAM2 converts into class-agnostic masks.

Code available at: https://github.com/charliezchen/scaling-matrix-preconditioning", "summary": "Several recently introduced deep learning optimizers utilizing matrix-level preconditioning have shown promising speedups relative to the current dominant optimizer AdamW, particularly in relatively small-scale experiments. However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $\u03bc$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $\u03bc$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling. Based on these results and further ablations, we argue that studying optimal hyperparameter transfer is essential for reliably comparing optimizers at scale given a realistic tuning budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982Shampoo\u3001SOAP\u3001Muon\uff09\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u03bcP\u7684learning rate\u7f29\u653e\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5757\u548c\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7f13\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff1bweight decay\u63091/width\u7f29\u653e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u6b63\u786e\u7f29\u653e\u4e0b\uff0cMuon\u548cShampoo\u5728190M\u20131.4B Llama\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4AdamW\u5feb1.4\u00d7\u548c1.3\u00d7\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982Shampoo\u3001Muon\uff09\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eAdamW\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u590d\u73b0\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u03bcP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790Shampoo\u3001SOAP\u3001Muon\u7b49\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684learning rate\u548cweight decay\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u5206\u5757\uff08blocking\uff09\u548c\u5ac1\u63a5\uff08grafting\uff09\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Llama\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff08190M\u20131.4B\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "1\uff09learning rate\u6309\u03bcP\u7f29\u653e\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u53c2\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7f13\u89e3\uff1b2\uff09weight decay\u63091/width\u7f29\u653e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\uff1b3\uff09\u6b63\u786e\u7f29\u653e\u4e0b\uff0cMuon\u548cShampoo\u5728Llama\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d85\u8d8aAdamW\uff081.4\u00d7\u548c1.3\u00d7\u52a0\u901f\uff09\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u7f29\u653e\u5219\u52a0\u901f\u8fc5\u901f\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u5ffd\u89c6\u7f29\u653e\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u03bcP\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f29\u653e+\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u5de7\uff08\u5982\u5206\u5757\u3001\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff09\u662f\u91ca\u653e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

The parts of a scene that are visible at any one time are governed by the occlusion of overlapping objects. In this work we consider \"dead leaves\" models, which replicate these occlusions when generating images by layering objects on top of each other. A dead leaves model is a generative model comprised of distributions for object position, shape, color and texture. An image is generated from a dead leaves model by sampling objects (\"leaves\") from these distributions until a stopping criterion is reached, usually when the image is fully covered or until a given number of leaves was sampled. Here, we describe a theoretical approach, based on previous work, to derive a Bayesian ideal observer for the partition of a given set of pixels based on independent dead leaves model distributions. Extending previous work, we provide step-by-step explanations for the computation of the posterior probability as well as describe factors that determine the feasibility of practically applying this computation.

While some classical algorithms can infer this number directly from the data, this is typically not the case for graph neural networks (GNNs): even when a desired number of clusters is specified, standard GNN-based methods often fail to return the exact number due to the way they are designed.

We introduce Conscious Gaze (CG-VLM), a training-free, inference-time framework that converts game-theoretic interpretability into actionable decoding control. A Cognitive Demand Sensor built on Harsanyi interactions estimates instantaneous vision-text synergy and identifies moments when visual grounding is necessary. Conditioned on this signal, a Focused Consensus Induction module selectively reorients mid-layer attention toward visual tokens before collapse into text priors.

Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map.

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU). Our results suggest SGTM provides a promising pretraining-time complement to existing safety mitigations, particularly in settings where label noise is unavoidable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSelective GradienT Masking (SGTM)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Gradient Routing\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u9694\u79bb\u6709\u5bb3\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u79fb\u9664\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u5371\u9669\u80fd\u529b\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff1bGradient Routing\u867d\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6297\u566a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "SGTM\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u63a9\u7801\u9009\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u6837\u672c\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u4e13\u5c5e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53cc\u8bed\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u82f1\u6587\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "SGTM\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u79fb\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u539fGradient Routing\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4fdd\u7559/\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u4e14\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u97007\u500d\u4e8eRMU\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6b65\u6570\u624d\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u9057\u5fd8\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "SGTM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5b89\u5168\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

However, current models still struggle to produce physically consistent results, particularly when handling large-scale or complex dynamics. This limitation arises primarily because existing approaches respond isotropically to physical prompts and neglect the fine-grained alignment between generated content and localized physical cues. To address these challenges, we propose ProPhy, a Progressive Physical Alignment Framework that enables explicit physics-aware conditioning and anisotropic generation. ProPhy employs a two-stage Mixture-of-Physics-Experts (MoPE) mechanism for discriminative physical prior extraction, where Semantic Experts infer semantic-level physical principles from textual descriptions, and Refinement Experts capture token-level physical dynamics. This mechanism allows the model to learn fine-grained, physics-aware video representations that better reflect underlying physical laws. Furthermore, we introduce a physical alignment strategy that transfers the physical reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) into the Refinement Experts, facilitating a more accurate representation of dynamic physical phenomena.

Currently, low-code/no-code platforms are widely used to enable end-user development through visual programming, minimizing the need for manual coding. Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly large language model-based assistants and \"copilots\", open new possibilities, as they may enable end users to generate and refine programming code and build apps directly from natural language prompts. This approach, here referred to as AI-assisted end-user coding, promises greater flexibility, broader applicability, faster development, improved reusability, and reduced vendor lock-in compared to the established visual LCNC platforms. This paper investigates whether AI-assisted end-user coding is a feasible paradigm for end-user development, which may complement or even replace the LCNC model in the future. To explore this, we conducted a case study in which non-programmers were asked to develop a basic web app through interaction with AI assistants.The majority of study participants successfully completed the task in reasonable time and also expressed support for AI-assisted end-user coding as a viable approach for end-user development. The paper presents the study design, analyzes the outcomes, and discusses potential implications for practice, future research, and academic teaching.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08AI-assisted end-user coding\uff09\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u4ee3\u7801/\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801\uff08LCNC\uff09\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6216\u8865\u5145\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9879\u975e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u7840Web\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f97\u51fa\u79ef\u6781\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u4ee3\u7801/\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801\u5e73\u53f0\u867d\u5df2\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u52a9\u624b\uff09\u4e3a\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5f00\u53d1\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u4e00\u9879\u9762\u5411\u975e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5176\u501f\u52a9AI\u52a9\u624b\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u7840Web\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u53ca\u4e3b\u89c2\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u5408\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba4\u53efAI\u8f85\u52a9\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7f16\u7a0b\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7f16\u7a0b\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u8865\u5145\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u672a\u6765\u90e8\u5206\u66ff\u4ee3LCNC\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u8df5\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Medical image registration methods rely on local intensity-based similarity measures, which fail to capture global semantic structure and often yield mismatches in low-contrast or anatomically variable regions. Recent advances in diffusion models suggest that their intermediate representations encode rich geometric and semantic information. We present MedDIFT, a training-free 3D correspondence framework that leverages multi-scale features from a pretrained latent medical diffusion model as voxel descriptors. MedDIFT fuses diffusion activations into rich voxel-wise descriptors and matches them via cosine similarity, with an optional local-search prior. On a publicly available lung CT dataset, MedDIFT achieves correspondence accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art learning-based UniGradICON model and surpasses conventional B-spline-based registration, without requiring any task-specific model training.

In current practice, analog beamforming uses a codebook of pre-configured beams with each of them radiating towards a specific direction, and a beam management function continuously selects \\textit{optimal} beams for moving user equipments (UEs). However, large codebooks and effects caused by reflections or blockages of beams make an optimal beam selection challenging. In contrast to previous work and standardization efforts that opt for supervised learning to train classifiers to predict the next best beam based on previously selected beams we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and model the environment as the codebook itself. At each time step, we select a candidate beam conditioned on the belief state of the unobservable optimal beam and previously probed beams. This frames the beam selection problem as an online search procedure that locates the moving optimal beam.

To simplify the cloth dynamics, existing methods mostly rely on linear blend skinning to obtain low-frequency posed garment shape and only regress high-frequency wrinkles. However, due to the lack of explicit skinning supervision, such skinning-based approach often produces misaligned shapes when posing the garment, consequently corrupts the high-frequency signals and fails to recover high-fidelity wrinkles. To tackle this issue, we propose a skinning-free approach by independently estimating posed (i) vertex position for low-frequency posed garment shape, and (ii) vertex normal for high-frequency local wrinkle details. In this way, each frequency modality can be effectively decoupled and directly supervised by the geometry of the deformed garment. To further improve the visual quality of animation, we propose to encode both vertex attributes as rendered texture images, so that 3D garment deformation can be equivalently achieved via 2D image transfer. This enables us to leverage powerful pretrained image models to recover fine-grained visual details in wrinkles, while maintaining superior scalability for garments of diverse topologies without relying on manual UV partition. Finally, we propose a multimodal fusion to incorporate constraints from both frequency modalities and robustly recover deformed 3D garments from transferred images.

We introduce a computational framework for teaching language models to predict chemical reaction mechanisms through arrow pushing formalism, a century-old notation that tracks electron flow while respecting conservation laws. We developed MechSMILES, a compact textual format encoding molecular structure and electron flow, and trained language models on four mechanism prediction tasks of increasing complexity using mechanistic reaction datasets, such as mech-USPTO-31k and FlowER. Our models achieve more than 95\\% top-3 accuracy on elementary step prediction and scores that surpass 73\\% on mech-USPTO-31k, and 93\\% on FlowER dataset for the retrieval of complete reaction mechanisms on our hardest task. This mechanistic understanding enables three key applications. First, our models serve as post-hoc validators for CASP systems, filtering chemically implausible transformations. Second, they enable holistic atom-to-atom mapping that tracks all atoms, including hydrogens. Third, they extract catalyst-aware reaction templates that distinguish recycled catalysts from spectator species.

Mobile laser scanning (MLS) has shown to be highly promising for extremely accurate, tree level inventory. In this study, we present NormalView, a sensor-agnostic projection-based deep learning method for classifying tree species from point cloud data. NormalView embeds local geometric information into two-dimensional projections, in the form of normal vector estimates, and uses the projections as inputs to an image classification network, YOLOv11. In addition, we inspected the effect of multispectral radiometric intensity information on classification performance. We trained and tested our model on high-density MLS data (7 species, ~5000 pts/m^2), as well as high-density airborne laser scanning (ALS) data (9 species, >1000 pts/m^2). On the MLS data, NormalView achieves an overall accuracy (macro-average accuracy) of 95.5 % (94.8 %), and 91.8 % (79.1 %) on the ALS data. We found that having intensity information from multiple scanners provides benefits in tree species classification, and the best model on the multispectral ALS dataset was a model using intensity information from all three channels of the multispectral ALS.

This setting is inherently challenging: source and target domains exhibit substantial distribution shifts, label spaces are disjoint, and support images are scarce--making standard episodic methods unreliable and computationally demanding at test time. To address these constraints, we propose DistillFSS, a framework that embeds support-set knowledge directly into a model's parameters through a teacher--student distillation process. By internalizing few-shot reasoning into a dedicated layer within the student network, DistillFSS eliminates the need for support images at test time, enabling fast, lightweight inference, while allowing efficient extension to novel classes in unseen domains through rapid teacher-driven specialization. Combined with fine-tuning, the approach scales efficiently to large support sets and significantly reduces computational overhead. To evaluate the framework under realistic conditions, we introduce a new CD-FSS benchmark spanning medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, with disjoint label spaces and variable support sizes. Experiments show that DistillFSS matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in multi-class and multi-shot scenarios, while offering substantial efficiency gains.

While classical analyses emphasize numerical stability of Jacobian products, we show that stability alone is insufficient: learnability is governed instead by the \\emph{effective learning rates} $\u03bc_{t,\\ell}$, per-lag and per-neuron quantities obtained from first-order expansions of gate-induced Jacobian products in Backpropagation Through Time. These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($\u03b1$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\\ell$ satisfies $N(\\ell)\\propto f(\\ell)^{-\u03b1}$, where $f(\\ell)=\\|\u03bc_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope. This leads to an explicit formula for $\\mathcal{H}_N$ and closed-form scaling laws for logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay of $f(\\ell)$. The theory predicts that broader or more heterogeneous gate spectra produce slower decay of $f(\\ell)$ and hence larger learnability windows, whereas heavier-tailed noise compresses $\\mathcal{H}_N$ by slowing statistical concentration. By linking gate-induced time-scale structure, gradient noise, and sample complexity, the framework identifies the effective learning rates as the fundamental quantities that govern when -- and for how long -- gated recurrent networks can learn long-range temporal dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u51b3\u5b9a\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3 $\\mathcal{H}_N$\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u2019$\u03bc_{t,\\ell}$ \u6765\u523b\u753b\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6ede\u540e\u4e0a\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5305\u7edc\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u4e58\u79ef\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u4ece\u95e8\u63a7\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u4f5c\u7528\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eBPTT\u4e2d\u95e8\u63a7\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u4e58\u79ef\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u6bcf\u6ede\u540e\u6bcf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387 $\u03bc_{t,\\ell}$\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u03b1-\u7a33\u5b9a\u91cd\u5c3e\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u68c0\u6d4b\u6ede\u540e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u6b64\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3 $\\mathcal{H}_N$ \u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u516c\u5f0f\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u8870\u51cf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5bf9\u6570\u3001\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u3001\u6307\u6570\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u6ee1\u8db3 $N(\\ell) \\propto f(\\ell)^{-\u03b1}$\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d $f(\\ell)=\\|\u03bc_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ \u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5305\u7edc\uff1b\u7ed9\u51fa $\\mathcal{H}_N$ \u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u95e8\u63a7\u8c31\u8d8a\u5bbd/\u8d8a\u5f02\u8d28 \u2192 $f(\\ell)$ \u8870\u51cf\u8d8a\u6162 \u2192 $\\mathcal{H}_N$ \u8d8a\u5927\uff1b\u566a\u58f0\u5c3e\u90e8\u8d8a\u91cd \u2192 $\\mathcal{H}_N$ \u8d8a\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387 $\u03bc_{t,\\ell}$ \u662f\u8fde\u63a5\u95e8\u63a7\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u95e8\u63a7RNN\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u65f6\u6548\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

This reliance on costly-to-acquire paired data remains a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel, unsupervised training framework based on Optimal Transport capable of training arbitrary ISP architectures in both unpaired and paired modes. We are the first to successfully apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) for this complex, cross-domain translation task. Our UOT-based framework provides robustness to outliers in the target sRGB data, allowing it to discount atypical samples that would be prohibitively costly to map. A key component of our framework is a novel ``committee of expert discriminators,'' a hybrid adversarial regularizer. This committee guides the optimal transport mapping by providing specialized, targeted gradients to correct specific ISP failure modes, including color fidelity, structural artifacts, and frequency-domain realism. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach, we retrained existing state-of-the-art ISP architectures using our paired and unpaired setups. Our experiments show that while our framework, when trained in paired mode, exceeds the performance of the original paired methods across all metrics, our unpaired mode concurrently achieves quantitative and qualitative performance that rivals, and in some cases surpasses, the original paired-trained counterparts.

We introduce a self-supervised approach for detecting AI-generated images that leverages camera metadata -- specifically exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags -- to learn features intrinsic to digital photography. Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\\eg, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\\eg, focal length and aperture value). Using these EXIF-induced features, we first perform one-class detection by modeling the distribution of photographic images with a Gaussian mixture model and flagging low-likelihood samples as AI-generated. We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u673aEXIF\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6444\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eEXIF\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u578bEXIF\u6807\u7b7e\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u673a\u578b\u53f7\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5e8f\u6570/\u8fde\u7eed\u578bEXIF\u6807\u7b7e\uff08\u5982\u7126\u8ddd\u3001\u5149\u5708\u503c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5bf9\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5206\u522b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u9891\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u4ee5EXIF\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u56fe\u50cf\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u7f29\u653e\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u673aEXIF\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684AI\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u53d6\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Despite rapid empirical progress, its theoretical foundations remain limited: existing methods (gradient, distribution, trajectory matching) are built on heterogeneous surrogate objectives and optimization assumptions, which makes it difficult to analyze their common principles or provide general guarantees. Moreover, it is still unclear under what conditions distilled data can retain the effectiveness of full datasets when the training configuration, such as optimizer, architecture, or augmentation, changes. To answer these questions, we propose a unified theoretical framework, termed configuration--dynamics--error analysis, which reformulates major DD approaches under a common generalization-error perspective and provides two main results: (i) a scaling law that provides a single-configuration upper bound, characterizing how the error decreases as the distilled sample size increases and explaining the commonly observed performance saturation effect; and (ii) a coverage law showing that the required distilled sample size scales linearly with configuration diversity, with provably matching upper and lower bounds. In addition, our unified analysis reveals that various matching methods are interchangeable surrogates, reducing the same generalization error, clarifying why they can all achieve dataset distillation and providing guidance on how surrogate choices affect sample efficiency and robustness. Experiments across diverse methods and configurations empirically confirm the derived laws, advancing a theoretical foundation for DD and enabling theory-driven design of compact, configuration-robust dataset distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u914d\u7f6e-\u52a8\u529b\u5b66-\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\uff08DD\uff09\u7684\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1a\u5355\u914d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u968f\u84b8\u998f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u84b8\u998f\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0e\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5f8b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u8bef\u5dee\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5176\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u5171\u6027\u539f\u7406\u6216\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u4e14\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u80fd\u5426\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u914d\u7f6e-\u52a8\u529b\u5b66-\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\u2019\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e3b\u6d41DD\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u63a8\u5bfc\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u5f8b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bef\u5dee\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\uff08i\uff09\u83b7\u5f97\u5355\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u84b8\u998f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754c\uff08\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u80fd\u9971\u548c\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\uff08ii\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u84b8\u998f\u6240\u9700\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0e\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u5339\u914d\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u5f8b\uff09\uff1b\uff08iii\uff09\u63ed\u793a\u68af\u5ea6/\u5206\u5e03/\u8f68\u8ff9\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u517c\u5177\u666e\u9002\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f55\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8fd8\u6307\u5bfc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce LeAD-M3D, a monocular 3D detector that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time inference without extra modalities. Our method is powered by three key components. Asymmetric Augmentation Denoising Distillation (A2D2) transfers geometric knowledge from a clean-image teacher to a mixup-noised student via a quality- and importance-weighted depth-feature loss, enabling stronger depth reasoning without LiDAR supervision. 3D-aware Consistent Matching (CM3D) improves prediction-to-ground truth assignment by integrating 3D MGIoU into the matching score, yielding more stable and precise supervision. Finally, Confidence-Gated 3D Inference (CGI3D) accelerates detection by restricting expensive 3D regression to top-confidence regions. Together, these components set a new Pareto frontier for monocular 3D detection: LeAD-M3D achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI and Waymo, and the best reported car AP on Rope3D, while running up to 3.6x faster than prior high-accuracy methods.

Real-time detection and interpretation of facial expressions have become increasingly important for various applications, from user experience personalization to intelligent surveillance systems. This study presents a novel approach to real-time sequential facial expression recognition using deep learning and geometric features. The proposed method utilizes MediaPipe FaceMesh for rapid and accurate facial landmark detection. Geometric features, including Euclidean distances and angles, are extracted from these landmarks. Temporal dynamics are incorporated by analyzing feature differences between consecutive frames, enabling the detection of onset, apex, and offset phases of expressions. For classification, a ConvLSTM1D network followed by multilayer perceptron blocks is employed. The method's performance was evaluated on multiple publicly available datasets, including CK+, Oulu-CASIA (VIS and NIR), and MMI. Accuracies of 93%, 79%, 77%, and 68% were achieved respectively. Experiments with composite datasets were also conducted to assess the model's generalization capabilities. The approach demonstrated real-time applicability, processing approximately 165 frames per second on consumer-grade hardware. This research contributes to the field of facial expression analysis by providing a fast, accurate, and adaptable solution. The findings highlight the potential for further advancements in emotion-aware technologies and personalized user experiences, paving the way for more sophisticated human-computer interaction systems.

Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u635f\u5931\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u65bd\u52a0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7fTransformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53d8\u5f97\u7a00\u758f\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u5e26\u7ea6\u675f\u635f\u5931\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fde\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8fde\u63a5\u51cf\u5c11\u81f3\u7ea60.3%\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u8def\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548cMLP\uff09\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u8fb9\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11100\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9002\u5ea6\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

This work presents an algorithm-unrolling-based network for the HSU task, named the 3D Convolutional Sparse Coding Network (3D-CSCNet), built upon a 3D CSC model. Unlike existing unrolling-based networks, our 3D-CSCNet is designed within the powerful autoencoder (AE) framework. Specifically, to solve the 3D CSC problem, we propose a 3D CSC block (3D-CSCB) derived through deep algorithm unrolling. Given a hyperspectral image (HSI), 3D-CSCNet employs the 3D-CSCB to estimate the abundance matrix. The use of 3D CSC enables joint learning of spectral and spatial relationships in the 3D HSI data cube. The estimated abundance matrix is then passed to the AE decoder to reconstruct the HSI, and the decoder weights are extracted as the endmember matrix. Additionally, we propose a projected simplex volume maximization (PSVM) algorithm for endmember estimation, and the resulting endmembers are used to initialize the decoder weights of 3D-CSCNet.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically inspired framework well-suited to these challenges due to their natural ability to process discrete events and preserve millisecond-scale timing. This work investigates the application of SNNs to high-frequency price-spike forecasting, enhancing performance via robust hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization (BO). This work converts high-frequency stock data into spike trains and evaluates three architectures: an established unsupervised STDP-trained SNN, a novel SNN with explicit inhibitory competition, and a supervised backpropagation network. BO was driven by a novel objective, Penalized Spike Accuracy (PSA), designed to ensure a network's predicted price spike rate aligns with the empirical rate of price events. Simulated trading demonstrated that models optimized with PSA consistently outperformed their Spike Accuracy (SA)-tuned counterparts and baselines. Specifically, the extended SNN model with PSA achieved the highest cumulative return (76.8%) in simple backtesting, significantly surpassing the supervised alternative (42.54% return).

These aberrations arise from distortions in the optical wavefront and can be mathematically represented using Zernike polynomials. Existing methods often address only mild aberrations on limited sample types and modalities, typically treating the problem as a black-box mapping without leveraging the underlying optical physics of wavefront distortions. We propose ZRNet, a physics-informed framework that jointly performs Zernike coefficient prediction and optical image Restoration. We contribute a Zernike Graph module that explicitly models physical relationships between Zernike polynomials based on their azimuthal degrees-ensuring that learned corrections align with fundamental optical principles. To further enforce physical consistency between image restoration and Zernike prediction, we introduce a Frequency-Aware Alignment (FAA) loss, which better aligns Zernike coefficient prediction and image features in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on CytoImageNet demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image restoration and Zernike coefficient prediction across diverse microscopy modalities and biological samples with complex, large-amplitude aberrations.

MMAs that experience high speeds or high cycles require liquid based lubricants due to their ability to reflow to the point of contact. However, only a few liquid-based lubricants have vapor pressures low enough for the vacuum conditions of space, each of which has limitations that add constraints to MMA designs. This work introduces a data-driven machine learning (ML) approach to predicting vapor pressure, enabling virtual screening and discovery of new space-suitable liquid lubricants. The ML models are trained with data from both high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations and experimental databases.

Existing approaches mainly generate pseudo labels and refine them through self-training iterations.

Moreover, effectively filtering and refining them remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose OWL for unsupervised 3D object detection by occupancy guided warm-up and large-model priors reasoning. OWL first employs an Occupancy Guided Warm-up (OGW) strategy to initialize the backbone weight with spatial perception capabilities, mitigating the interference of incorrect pseudo-labels on network convergence. Furthermore, OWL introduces an Instance-Cued Reasoning (ICR) module that leverages the prior knowledge of large models to assess pseudo-label quality, enabling precise filtering and refinement. Finally, we design a Weight-adapted Self-training (WAS) strategy to dynamically re-weight pseudo-labels, improving the performance through self-training.

This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable.

We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings.

Although recent methods have achieved reasonable global shape reconstruction, they often rely on Euclidean proximity and overlook the intrinsic nonlinear geometric structure of point clouds, resulting in suboptimal geometric consistency and semantic ambiguity. In this paper, we present a manifold-aware point cloud completion framework that explicitly incorporates nonlinear geometry information throughout the feature learning pipeline. Our approach introduces two key modules: a Geodesic Distance Approximator (GDA), which estimates geodesic distances between points to capture the latent manifold topology, and a Manifold-Aware Feature Extractor (MAFE), which utilizes geodesic-based $k$-NN groupings and a geodesic-relational attention mechanism to guide the hierarchical feature extraction process. By integrating geodesic-aware relational attention, our method promotes semantic coherence and structural fidelity in the reconstructed point clouds.

Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference.

However, current VLMs show deficits in domain specific surgical scene understanding, such as identifying and explaining anatomical landmarks during Complete Mesocolic Excision. Additionally, there is a need for locally deployable models to avoid patient data leakage to large VLMs, hosted outside the clinic. We propose a privacy-preserving framework to distill knowledge from large, general-purpose LLMs into an efficient, local VLM. We generate an expert-supervised dataset by prompting a teacher LLM without sensitive images, using only textual context and binary segmentation masks for spatial information. This dataset is used for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) of the locally deployable VLM. Our evaluation confirms that finetuning VLMs with our generated datasets increases surgical domain knowledge compared to its base VLM by a large margin. Overall, this work validates a data-efficient and privacy-conforming way to train a surgical domain optimized, locally deployable VLM for surgical scene understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5b8c\u6574\u7ed3\u80a0\u7cfb\u819c\u5207\u9664\u672f\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4ec5\u7528\u6587\u672c\u548c\u4e8c\u503c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u7684\u5916\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u5728\u5916\u79d1\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u4e91\u7aef\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5316\u5916\u79d1\u4e13\u7528VLM\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u654f\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6559\u5e08LLM\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u4e8c\u503c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5bf9\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u672c\u5730VLM\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684VLM\u5728\u5916\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5411\u672c\u5730\u5916\u79d1\u4e13\u7528VLM\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, their high computational and memory costs pose challenges for deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce storage overhead and accelerate inference. Nevertheless, existing quantization methods for diffusion models struggle to mitigate outliers in activation matrices during inference, leading to substantial performance degradation under low-bit quantization scenarios. To address this, we propose HQ-DM, a novel Quantization-Aware Training framework that applies Single Hadamard Transformation to activation matrices. This approach effectively reduces activation outliers while preserving model performance under quantization. Compared to traditional Double Hadamard Transformation, our proposed scheme offers distinct advantages by seamlessly supporting INT convolution operations while preventing the amplification of weight outliers.

This paper presents a rigorous approach to the general design of $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz deep residual networks using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) framework. Initially, the ResNet architecture was reformulated as a cyclic tridiagonal LMI, and closed-form constraints on network parameters were derived to ensure $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz continuity; however, using a new $LDL^\\top$ decomposition approach for certifying LMI feasibility, we extend the construction of $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipchitz networks to any other nonlinear architecture. Our contributions include a provable parameterization methodology for constructing Lipschitz-constrained residual networks and other hierarchical architectures. Cholesky decomposition is also used for efficient parameterization. These findings enable robust network designs applicable to adversarial robustness, certified training, and control systems.

In this work, we introduce USV (Unified Sparsification for Video diffusion models), an end-to-end trainable framework that overcomes this limitation by jointly orchestrating sparsification across both the model's internal computation and its sampling process.

This multi-dimensional co-design enables strong mutual reinforcement among previously disjoint acceleration strategies. Extensive experiments on large-scale video generation benchmarks demonstrate that USV achieves up to 83.3% speedup in the denoising process and 22.7% end-to-end acceleration, while maintaining high visual fidelity.

Yet, as sequence length and batch size grow, the cache becomes a major memory bottleneck. Prior compression methods typically apply low-rank decomposition to keys alone or attempt to jointly embed queries and keys, but both approaches neglect that attention fundamentally depends on their inner products. In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix.

An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \\emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy. To address this, we introduce new theoretical results providing both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap for such surrogates. Guided by this theory, we propose a novel disagreement loss that, when paired with cross-entropy, yields a provably consistent surrogate for disagreement discrepancy. Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust estimates of disagreement discrepancy than existing approaches, particularly under challenging adversarial conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316disagreement discrepancy\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u800c\u5931\u6548\uff1bdisagreement discrepancy\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u6709\u5bb3\u504f\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u76840-1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bdisagreement\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u7ed3\u5408\u6784\u6210\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684disagreement discrepancy\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709disagreement discrepancy\u4ee3\u7406\u635f\u5931\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u65b0\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data.

Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines. These results show that adversarially trained generative models provide a scalable and principled approach for imputing and merging incomplete, heterogeneous data.

To resolve the above challenges, we develop a novel Continual Customized Video Diffusion (CCVD) model, which can continuously learn new concepts to generate videos across various text-to-video generation tasks by tackling forgetting and concept neglect. To address catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a concept-specific attribute retention module and a task-aware concept aggregation strategy. They can capture the unique characteristics and identities of old concepts during training, while combining all subject and motion adapters of old concepts based on their relevance during testing. Besides, to tackle concept neglect, we develop a controllable conditional synthesis to enhance regional features and align video contexts with user conditions, by incorporating layer-specific region attention-guided noise estimation. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that our CCVD outperforms existing CTVG models.

However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $\u03b1$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences. On a Lean theorem-proving benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance along the coverage-precision Pareto frontier, outperforming all prior methods on the coverage axis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u03b1-\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728Lean\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6-\u7cbe\u5ea6Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8eRL\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u9006KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff08\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfb\u6c42\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u5176\u4ed6\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u3001\u4ec5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u76f8\u5bf9\u6982\u7387\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u03b1-\u6563\u5ea6\u65cf\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u8c03\u63a7\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u8986\u76d6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728Lean\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6-\u7cbe\u5ea6Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u8c03\u03b1-\u6563\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3RL\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

However, most existing classification frameworks face challenges in multicenter studies, as they often neglect inter-site heterogeneity and lack mechanisms to quantify uncertainty, which limits their robustness and clinical applicability. To address these issues, we proposed Uncertainty-Guided Federated Domain Adaptation (UG-FedDA), a novel multicenter AD classification framework that integrates uncertainty quantification (UQ) with federated domain adaptation to handle cross-site structure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) heterogeneity under privacy constraints. Our approach extracts multi-template region-of-interest (RoI) features using a self-attention transformer, capturing both regional representations and their interactions. UQ is integrated to guide feature alignment, mitigating source-target distribution shifts by down-weighting uncertain samples. Experiments are conducted on three public datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). UG-FedDA achieved consistent cross-domain improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the ROC curve across three classification tasks: AD vs. normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI. For NC vs. AD, UG-FedDA achieves accuracies of 90.54%, 89.04%, and 77.78% on ADNI, AIBL and OASIS datasets, respectively. For MCI vs. AD, accuracies are 80.20% (ADNI), 71.91% (AIBL), and 79.73% (OASIS). For NC vs. MCI, results are 76.87% (ADNI), 73.91% (AIBL), and 83.73% (OASIS).

A novel approach is introduced to enhance Phase-OTDR data analysis by transforming 1D data into grayscale images through techniques such as Gramian Angular Difference Field, Gramian Angular Summation Field, and Recurrence Plot. These grayscale images are combined into a multi-channel RGB representation, enabling more robust and adaptable analysis using transfer learning models. The proposed methodology achieves high classification accuracies of 98.84% and 98.24% with the EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121 models, respectively. A 5-fold cross-validation process confirms the reliability of these models, with test accuracy rates of 99.07% and 98.68%.

However, more modalities bring more vulnerabilities to being utilized for jailbreak attacks, which induces MLLMs to output harmful content. Due to the strong reasoning ability of MLLMs, previous jailbreak attacks try to explore reasoning safety risk in text modal, while similar threats have been largely overlooked in the visual modal. To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images. In particular, to enhance the rationality of the scene in the image sequence, we propose Adaptive Scene Refinement to optimize the scene most relevant to the original harmful query. To ensure the semantic continuity of the generated image, we propose Semantic Coherent Completion to iteratively rewrite each sub-text combined with contextual information in this scene. In addition, we propose Text-Image Consistency Alignment to keep the semantical consistency. A series of experiments demonstrates that the VRSA can achieve a higher attack success rate compared with the state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods on both the open-source and closed-source MLLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-4.5-Sonnet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u987a\u5e8f\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08VRSA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u6587\u672c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6b65\u66b4\u9732\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347 jailbreak \u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 jailbreak \u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5a01\u80c1\uff1b\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30 MLLMs \u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack\uff08VRSA\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09Adaptive Scene Refinement\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u573a\u666f\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff1b2\uff09Semantic Coherent Completion\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u8865\u5168\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u5199\u5b50\u6587\u672c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff1b3\uff09Text-Image Consistency Alignment\uff08\u56fe\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u786e\u4fdd\u56fe\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "VRSA \u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90 MLLMs\uff08\u5982 GPT-4o\u3001Claude-4.5-Sonnet\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb jailbreak \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u5b58\u5728\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e jailbreak \u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff1bVRSA \u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e2d\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a MLLM \u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

While editing in the RAW domain provides greater accuracy and flexibility, most edits are performed on the camera's display-referred output (e.g., 8-bit sRGB JPEG) since RAW images are rarely stored. Existing RAW reconstruction methods can recover RAW data from sRGB images, but these approaches are typically optimized for pixel-wise RAW reconstruction fidelity and tend to degrade under diverse rendering styles and editing operations. We introduce a plug-and-play, edit-aware loss function that can be integrated into any existing RAW reconstruction framework to make the recovered RAWs more robust to different rendering styles and edits. Our loss formulation incorporates a modular, differentiable image signal processor (ISP) that simulates realistic photofinishing pipelines with tunable parameters. During training, parameters for each ISP module are randomly sampled from carefully designed distributions that model practical variations in real camera processing. The loss is then computed in sRGB space between ground-truth and reconstructed RAWs rendered through this differentiable ISP. Incorporating our loss improves sRGB reconstruction quality by up to 1.5-2 dB PSNR across various editing conditions. Moreover, when applied to metadata-assisted RAW reconstruction methods, our approach enables fine-tuning for target edits, yielding further gains. Since photographic editing is the primary motivation for RAW reconstruction in consumer imaging, our simple yet effective loss function provides a general mechanism for enhancing edit fidelity and rendering flexibility across existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4ecesRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efaRAW\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5faeISP\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728sRGB\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u8f91\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6237\u5e38\u5bf9\u62cd\u6444\u540e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u671f\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u800cRAW\u57df\u7f16\u8f91\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u8bbe\u5907\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u4fdd\u5b58RAW\u56fe\uff0c\u9700\u4ecesRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efaRAW\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f16\u8f91\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u5fae\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316ISP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5ISP\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837ISP\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u5b9e\u9645\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u635f\u5931\u5728sRGB\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8eISP\u6e32\u67d3\u540e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u8f91\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0csRGB\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe1.5\u20132 dB PSNR\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8f85\u52a9\u7684RAW\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u9488\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u7f16\u8f91\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709RAW\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5951\u5408\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u4ee5\u7f16\u8f91\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, water causes severe image degradation through wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and haze effects. Traditional reconstruction methods and convolutional neural network-based approaches often fail to adequately address these challenges due to limited receptive fields and inability to model global dependencies. This paper presented a novel deep learning framework that integrated a Swin Transformer architecture within a generative adversarial network (GAN) for underwater image reconstruction. Our generator employed a U-Net structure with Swin Transformer blocks to capture both local features and long-range dependencies crucial for color correction across entire images. A PatchGAN discriminator provided adversarial training to ensure high-frequency detail preservation. We trained and evaluated our model on the EUVP dataset, which contains paired underwater images of varying quality. Quantitative results demonstrate stateof-the-art performance with PSNR of 24.76 dB and SSIM of 0.89, representing significant improvements over existing methods.

Accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction remains challenging due to the complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing biomechanical, parametric models and deep-learning approaches either lack computational efficiency or fail to fully capture these intricate interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge. The deformation decoders output point-wise displacement fields, enabling precise modeling of surgical outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, notably improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions such as lips and chin, while robustly preserving anatomical integrity.

Recent works address these challenges by constructing a clustering prototype bank and then refining masks in a separate stage; however, such two-stage pipelines are costly, sensitive to hyperparameters, and decouple prototype discovery from segmentation learning, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a cluster-free, one-stage learnable-prototype framework with diversity regularization to enhance morphological intra-class heterogeneity coverage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on BCSS-WSSS, outperforming prior methods in mIoU and mDice.

Its success is largely attributed to deep learning, which leverages large datasets and effective loss functions to learn discriminative features. Despite these advances, facial recognition still faces challenges in explainability, demographic bias, privacy, and robustness to aging, pose variations, lighting changes, occlusions, and facial expressions. Privacy regulations have also led to the degradation of several datasets, raising legal, ethical, and privacy concerns. Synthetic facial data generation has been proposed as a promising solution. It mitigates privacy issues, enables experimentation with controlled facial attributes, alleviates demographic bias, and provides supplementary data to improve models trained on real data. This study compares the effectiveness of synthetic facial datasets generated using different techniques in facial recognition tasks. We evaluate accuracy, rank-1, rank-5, and the true positive rate at a false positive rate of 0.01% on eight leading datasets, offering a comparative analysis not extensively explored in the literature. Results demonstrate the ability of synthetic data to capture realistic variations while emphasizing the need for further research to close the performance gap with real data.

Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAQUA-Net\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u6c34\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7167\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6062\u590d\u8272\u5f69\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u5730\u4e2d\u6d77\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u771f\u5b9e\u6c34\u4e0b\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u989c\u8272\u5931\u771f\u3001\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u548c\u96fe\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAQUA-Net\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\uff1a\u9891\u57df\u878d\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u4e0e\u7167\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eRetinex\u7406\u8bba\u5b66\u4e60\u7167\u5ea6\u56fe\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6821\u6b63\u66dd\u5149\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u66f4\u5c11\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9891\u57df\u4e0e\u7167\u5ea6\u5206\u652f\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5730\u4e2d\u6d77\u771f\u5b9e\u6c34\u4e0b\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AQUA-Net\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6c34\u4e0b\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing approaches improve instruction adherence via supervised or reinforcement learning, yet single-turn success rates remain limited due to inherent stochasticity and a lack of deliberation. In this work, we propose a deliberative editing framework to 'think' while they edit, which simulates the human cognitive loop by iteratively executing a Think-while-Edit cycle: Critiquing results and Refining instructions , followed by Repeating the generation until satisfactory. Specifically, we train a single MLLM, EditThinker, to act as the reasoning engine of this framework, which jointly produce the critique score, reasoning process, and refined instructions. We employ reinforcement learning to align the EditThinker's thinking with its editing, thereby generating more targeted instruction improvements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the instruction-following capability of any image editing model by a large margin.
