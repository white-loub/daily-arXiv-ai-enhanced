### [1] [Exploring the Capabilities of LLM Encoders for Image-Text Retrieval in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15234)
*Hanbin Ko,Gihun Cho,Inhyeok Baek,Donguk Kim,Joonbeom Koo,Changi Kim,Dongheon Lee,Chang Min Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LLM2VEC4CXR与LLM2CLIP4CXR框架，通过领域适配LLM编码器提升胸部X光影像与临床文本对齐效果，强调鲁棒性优于单纯数据规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床报告异构性（缩写、风格差异等）阻碍医学影像-文本对齐，传统扩大数据规模反而可能降低模型性能。

Method: 构建领域适配的LLM文本编码器LLM2VEC4CXR，并与视觉骨干结合成双塔框架LLM2CLIP4CXR，在160万异构CXR数据上训练。

Result: 在文本理解、缩写处理、跨数据集泛化及临床对齐指标上优于BERT基线与现有医学CLIP模型。

Conclusion: 医学多模态学习的关键在于鲁棒性设计，而非仅依赖数据规模；开源模型促进后续研究。

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress
in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports,
including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability.
Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better
performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau
or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM)
encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across
diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR,
a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a
dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone.
LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines,
handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical
alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to
boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger
cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M
CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy
reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the
key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further
research in medical image-text representation learning.

### [2] [ORCA: Agentic Reasoning For Hallucination and Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15435)
*Chung-En Johnny Yu,Hsuan-Chih,Chen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORCA是一个通过结构化推理提升大型视觉语言模型事实准确性和对抗鲁棒性的框架，无需重新训练或访问模型内部。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型易受幻觉和对抗攻击影响，限制了其在现实应用中的可靠性。

Method: 采用Observe-Reason-Critique-Act循环，结合多个小型视觉模型进行证据提问、交叉验证和迭代优化。

Result: 在POPE和AMBER基准测试中，ORCA显著提升了模型准确率，最高达+48.00%。

Conclusion: ORCA为构建更可靠、鲁棒的多模态系统提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities
but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial
attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world
applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the
factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through
test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models
(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act
loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating
cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without
access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate
reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed
primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent
adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense
mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on
hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,
and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE
hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\%
to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,
ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined
with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further
improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to
+48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers
a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

### [3] [ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235)
*Jialiang Kang,Han Shu,Wenshuo Li,Yingjie Zhai,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSpec是一种为视觉语言模型设计的新型推测解码框架，通过轻量级视觉适配器压缩图像信息并增强多模态一致性，首次在VLM推测解码中实现显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法在视觉语言模型上加速效果有限，而多模态能力日益重要，亟需更高效方案。

Method: 引入轻量视觉适配器压缩图像令牌，保留位置信息并融入草稿模型注意力机制；提取全局图像特征增强文本连贯性；构建长回复多模态训练数据集，防止草稿模型走捷径。

Result: 实验证明ViSpec在VLM推测解码中首次实现显著加速，突破此前<1.5x的局限。

Conclusion: ViSpec为视觉语言模型推理加速提供了有效新框架，推动多模态大模型高效部署。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models
(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest
speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal
capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large
VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without
compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do
so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a
novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor
module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is
seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while
preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a
global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text
tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the
scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a
specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating
extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training
strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the
target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning
when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate
ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM
speculative decoding.

### [4] [CoPAD : Multi-source Trajectory Fusion and Cooperative Trajectory Prediction with Anchor-oriented Decoder in V2X Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15984)
*Kangyu Wu,Jiaqi Qiao,Ya Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPAD是一种轻量级协同轨迹预测框架，在V2X场景中实现高精度与高完整性预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单车感知的不稳定性限制了轨迹预测性能，需借助协同感知提升效果。

Method: 结合匈牙利算法与卡尔曼滤波的融合模块、PTA模块、模式注意力模块和锚点解码器，实现多源数据早期融合。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X-Seq数据集上达到SOTA性能，验证模型有效性。

Conclusion: CoPAD显著提升协同轨迹预测精度与多样性，适用于V2X环境。

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable
results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving.
However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain
limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight
framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This
framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and
Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode
attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs
early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road
infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.
The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among
historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich
the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors
is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments
show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq
dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory
prediction in V2X scenarios.

### [5] [M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241)
*Shreyash Verma,Amit Kesari,Vinayak Trivedi,Anupam Purwar,Ratnesh Jamidar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PACE是一个基于多模态大模型的合规性评估框架，能单次处理图文内容并显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合规框架分散、扩展性差，难以适应动态规则，需统一高效方案。

Method: 采用母子MLLM架构，母模型评估子模型输出，构建带增强样本的人工标注基准。

Result: 推理成本降低31倍以上，Gemini 2.0 Flash每图仅0.0005美元，准确率与高价模型相当。

Conclusion: M-PACE实现广告合规自动化，在成本与质量间取得实时平衡，适合大规模部署。

Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or
platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge
across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed,
multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification,
text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based
merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead,
hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines
efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single,
general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual
content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance
Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across
vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply
M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over
15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we
introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that
simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and
profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating
that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can
significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality
control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times,
with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by
mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5
Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and
output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over
advertising data.

### [6] [ProFusion: 3D Reconstruction of Protein Complex Structures from Multi-view AFM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15242)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProFusion结合深度学习与原子力显微镜，通过虚拟AFM数据集和扩散模型实现高效低成本的蛋白质复合物三维结构预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI方法在大型蛋白复合物结构预测中缺乏空间线索、实验方法成本高的问题。

Method: 构建虚拟AFM数据集，训练条件扩散模型合成多视角图像，并用NeRF重建三维结构。

Result: 重建结构平均Chamfer距离在AFM分辨率内，验证于多种实验AFM图像，结构保真度高。

Conclusion: 该方法具备高精度、低成本优势，适用于蛋白复合物结构快速预测与实验验证。

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but
often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple
interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques
like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion,
a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random
orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction.
However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep
learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework
that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins
with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to
synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D
protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging
resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively
validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong
potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and
rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

### [7] [Multi-Modal Interpretability for Enhanced Localization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15243)
*Muhammad Imran,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEL框架通过多尺度特征处理和自适应注意力加权，提升视觉-语言模型的可解释性，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键场景中，视觉-语言模型因对象关系复杂、视觉线索细微及对透明度和可靠性要求高而应用受限。

Method: 提出MMEL框架，结合梯度解释方法，引入分层语义关系模块，进行多尺度特征处理、自适应注意力加权与跨模态对齐。

Result: 实验表明MMEL生成的可视化更聚焦、具上下文感知，能更好反映模型对复杂场景的理解。

Conclusion: MMEL框架具跨领域通用性，适用于高可解释性与可靠性需求的应用场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the
frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in
safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships
between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency
and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning
(MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language
models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in
gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL
introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances
model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive
attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features
at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at
different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance
contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive
visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual
relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on
standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship
information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused
and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language
models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various
domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications
requiring high interpretability and reliability.

### [8] [Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250)
*Wenda Qin,Andrea Burns,Bryan A. Plummer,Margrit Betke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出导航感知剪枝方法NAP，通过预过滤和减少背景标记，在保持高成功率的同时节省超50%计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标记剪枝方法忽视VLN任务特性，导致效率提升受限。

Method: 利用导航特征预分前景/背景标记，结合大语言模型提取指令，专注剪枝背景并抑制回溯。

Result: 在标准VLN基准上显著优于先前方法，节省超50% FLOPS且保持高成功率。

Conclusion: NAP有效解决VLN中剪枝导致的信息损失与路径增长问题，实现高效导航。

Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token
pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss
by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges.
For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase
computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify
uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To
address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses
navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering
tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered
based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract
navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,
we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further
help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by
removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN
benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher
success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

### [9] [RespoDiff: Dual-Module Bottleneck Transformation for Responsible & Faithful T2I Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15257)
*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Sauradip Nag,Muhammad Awais,Serge Belongie,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RespoDiff是一种新型负责任文本到图像生成框架，通过双模块变换提升公平性与安全性，同时保持语义对齐和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提升公平性与安全性时牺牲了语义保真度和图像质量，亟需兼顾多目标的解决方案。

Method: 提出双模块架构，分别学习负责任概念与语义对齐，并设计新型得分匹配目标协调二者。

Result: 在不损害图像质量前提下，责任生成性能提升20%，并可无缝集成至SDXL等大模型。

Conclusion: RespoDiff有效平衡安全、公平与语义保真，为负责任生成提供实用新方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and
semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and
safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness
and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work,
we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image
generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate
bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two
distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible
concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining
semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning
process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective
coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while
optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach
improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across
diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale
models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自引导和在线数据选择方法对生成扩散模型训练效率的影响，发现自引导能稳定提升样本质量，而早期选择虽有效但复杂度高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低生成模型计算成本，探索高效数据筛选方法以提升训练效率。

Method: 整合JEST与自引导方法，在合成数据与图像生成任务中进行基准测试。

Result: 自引导显著提升样本质量与多样性；早期AJEST在数据效率上略优，但因开销大不具实用性。

Conclusion: 自引导是提升样本质量的核心手段，数据选择仅在特定早期阶段具有效率优势。

Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for
efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently
developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time
and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate
joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for
fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a
controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image
generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number
of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across
experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity.
Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or
modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However,
its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data
selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while
targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust
sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss
limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业场景中用户需确保AI生成内容来源可信，亟需可溯源的生成式AI技术。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，利用傅里叶变换的径向缩减提取模型特异性签名，并通过线性判别分析聚类实现溯源。

Result: 在自建PRISM-36K数据集上准确率达92.04%，在四个基准数据集平均达81.60%，在真实/伪造图像检测任务中平均达88.41%。

Conclusion: 频域指纹技术能有效实现跨架构、跨数据集的模型溯源，有助于提升生成式AI的可问责性与信任度。

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is,
solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This
feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive
in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and
expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address
these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image
Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is
based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages
amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The
output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant
analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the
model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct
PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN-
and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution
accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from
the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate
our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images,
achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage
with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for
cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable
solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了ViT、CLIP、DINOv2和DINOv3在多种心理旋转任务中的表现，发现自监督ViT优于监督ViT，中间层表现更佳，任务难度与旋转复杂度和遮挡相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究现代视觉Transformer是否具备类似人类的心理旋转能力，以理解其空间推理机制。

Method: 通过逐层分析模型表征，在从简单积木到真实物体的多种心理旋转任务中系统评估多个视觉模型。

Result: 自监督ViT更擅长捕捉几何结构；中间层优于最终层；任务难度随旋转复杂度和遮挡增加，与人类反应时间趋势一致。

Conclusion: 视觉Transformer在心理旋转任务中展现出与人类相似的空间表征约束，尤其自监督模型和中间层表现突出。

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been
central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success
of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models
develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from
simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study
human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and
photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we
examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised
ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate
layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with
rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and
suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

Result: 实验在两个常用数据集上揭示了token类型、任务、预训练目标与决策规则之间的最佳匹配关系。

Conclusion: 原始ViT特征本身具备强大表征能力，合理选择token与决策规则可避免额外变换仍取得优异性能。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently
demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in
standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate
the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image
Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention
block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features
obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common
foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing
approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through
additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined
with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods
can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive
analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features
has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically
evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and
segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification
and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic
regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of
interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules
and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an
analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study
provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule
based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting
detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are
not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context.
While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising
capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to
perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models
can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we
propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making
scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to
interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and
safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a
large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation

future research in robot intelligence. Our data and code will be made publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法存在文本描述不准确和视觉-语言嵌入对齐有限的问题，影响零样本泛化能力。

Method: 提出CoDoL方法，结合领域元网络（DMN）生成条件提示，优化跨域视觉-语言对齐。

Result: 在PACS、VLCS、OfficeHome和DigitDG四个基准上验证了CoDoL在提升嵌入对齐和OOD泛化方面的有效性。

Conclusion: CoDoL有效缓解了CLIP在OOD场景下的局限，显著提升模型鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.,
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great
potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite
showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer
from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and
robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited
vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the
generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes
readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the
vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To
capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further
propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional
tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks
(PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed
CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as
the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

TL;DR: AdaptiveNN是一种主动适应性视觉模型框架，通过模仿人类视觉的注视机制，在保证精度的同时大幅降低推理成本，并提升模型的灵活性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器视觉模型被动处理全场景，资源消耗大，限制了实际应用与未来发展。

Method: 将视觉感知建模为由粗到细的序列决策过程，结合表征学习与自奖励强化学习进行端到端训练。

Result: 在17个基准测试中实现最高28倍推理成本降低，适应不同任务与资源预算，且行为接近人类视觉认知。

Conclusion: AdaptiveNN为高效、灵活、可解释的计算机视觉提供了新范式，并有望成为研究视觉认知的有力工具。

Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments
by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing
machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in
excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and
model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and
real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework
aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision
models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential
decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions
pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,
and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory
integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,
enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without
additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17
benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,
fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving
and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side
comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction
without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and
resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via
its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,
flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits
closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential
as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at

TL;DR: LowDiff是一种基于级联方法的高效扩散框架，通过从低分辨率逐步生成高分辨率图像，显著提升采样效率并保持高质量生成结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型采样速度慢，现有方法忽视多分辨率生成潜力。

Method: 采用统一模型级联式从低到高分辨率逐步精炼图像，减少高分辨率采样步数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、FFHQ和ImageNet上实现超50%吞吐量提升，FID和IS指标媲美或更优。

Conclusion: LowDiff在保持生成质量的同时显著提升效率，具有广泛适用性和通用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior
efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or
reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the
possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.
In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework
based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution
outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine
images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed
architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even
superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is
applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive
experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across
CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our
method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and
settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional
CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional
CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an
FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1
produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together
with substantial efficiency gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在处理含多对象、属性及空间关系的提示时易出现组合失败，如实体纠缠、属性错配和空间违反。

Method: 提出MaskAttn-SDXL，在SDXL的UNet交叉注意力logits上学习每层二值掩码，稀疏化token-latent交互，仅保留语义相关连接。

Result: 模型在多对象提示中显著提升空间合规性与属性绑定，同时保持图像质量与多样性。

Conclusion: logit级掩码交叉注意力是实现组合控制的高效机制，为文本到图像生成提供实用的空间控制扩展。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer
from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and
spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities
entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To
address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating
mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s
UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each
cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent
interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The
method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region
masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In
practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in
multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.
These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an
data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method
thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image
generation.

TL;DR: RaceGAN是一种新型多域图像翻译框架，能在无参考图像情况下保持个体特征并高效转换种族属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型如StarGANv2和StyleGAN需依赖参考图像且难以保持个体性，RaceGAN旨在解决此问题。

Method: 提出RaceGAN框架，通过跨域风格编码映射实现种族属性翻译，无需参考图像。

Result: 在Chicago Face Dataset上优于其他模型，能有效翻译亚裔、白人、黑人特征，并通过InceptionReNetv2分类验证效果。

Conclusion: RaceGAN成功实现个体性保持的种族特征翻译，且能有效划分各族群潜在空间聚类。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress
in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several
applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was
restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling
image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to
map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via
reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of
StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and
need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to
translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We
present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several
domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and
high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms
other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black)
when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings
utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the
model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each
ethnic group.

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods
often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images.
Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive
annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that
leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently
transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global
symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately
providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large
scale.

Conclusion: 该方法具备强泛化能力，在身份保护与模型溯源领域潜力显著。

Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which
are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source
attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts,
yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different
generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect
the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely
unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of
generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that
disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant
latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We
further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.
We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across
representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization
using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments
show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating
strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity
protection.

Motivation: 神经肿瘤学数据异质性强、肿瘤复杂，现有基础模型泛化能力差，尤其对罕见分子标记预测不佳，影响治疗响应与风险分层。

Method: 采用自监督预训练（BYOL、DINO、MAE、MoCo）结合分布鲁棒优化（DRO），缓解机构与类别不平衡，提升表型估计与跨机构泛化能力。

Result: 在CUIMC、UPenn、UCSF三中心测试中，分子标记预测准确率与AUC显著提升，罕见标记如CDKN2A/2B、ATRX、Ki-67改善明显，生存预测c-index亦提升，模型具可解释性。

Conclusion: 基础模型结合DRO可生成更稳健表征，提升常见与罕见标记预测及生存分析，需前瞻性验证与整合纵向干预数据推动精准神经肿瘤学发展。

Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to
heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation
models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in
predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment
response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a
neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,
enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining
cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones
(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class
imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers
(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),
continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1
wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular
prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean
balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with
the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to
0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).
For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647
to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral
regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields
more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon
markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for
prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional
signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

Motivation: 传统可变形卷积受限于固定四边形采样区域，难以灵活匹配图像内容。

Method: 每个核元素使用四个边界偏移量，构建可动态调整大小和形状的矩形区域。

Result: 能精确控制感受野宽高，兼顾局部细节与长程依赖，即使1x1核也有效。

Conclusion: 该设计兼具注意力机制灵活性与标准卷积效率，为构建高效视觉模型提供实用方案。

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new
convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to
complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are
limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary
offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that
dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach
allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling
the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small
1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's
structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the
efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical
solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the
gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly
attention-based methods.

Conclusion: CAGE有效提升平面图重建的鲁棒性与几何完整性，架构创新具有实际价值。

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a
\textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly
from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations
are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in
fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage
structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine
geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native}
edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed,
geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of
coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room
boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this
design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed
and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes
optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on
Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\%
(angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained
models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is
limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to
overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised
learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges.
We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic
health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive
architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our
approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model
in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC),
but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC).
We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA
may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled
multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its
advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

Conclusion: EDGE显著提升多模态数据集蒸馏效率与性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset,
enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With
the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the
importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown
significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are
constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which
significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to
process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative
distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation.
Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets
with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and
captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow
with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we
propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval
performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on
Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and
efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves
results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic
automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future
state prediction (world model), and video decoding to dedicated models. These
approaches often utilize large models that require significant training
resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly
available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and
present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving
scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video
generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components
of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image
tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful
pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by
publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale.
Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces
of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models
and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and
models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict
realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of
algorithmic latency.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注任务性能，但对模型内部表征结构和变异性了解不足，需系统分析以指导模型优化与部署。

Method: 采用计算神经科学中的表征相似性分析方法，对六种模型在TCGA数据上的表征空间进行比较，评估其相似性、维度及对切片/疾病/染色的依赖性。

Result: UNI2与Virchow2表征结构最独特，Prov-GigaPath与其他模型相似度最高；视觉语言模型表征更紧凑；染色归一化可降低切片依赖性；训练范式不决定表征相似性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了基础模型表征结构的多样性，为提升模型鲁棒性、设计集成策略及理解训练范式影响提供了关键洞见，框架可推广至其他医学影像领域。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology
(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent
studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the
structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we
systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation
models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models
analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and
self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through
representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find
that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,
whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having
the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee
higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a
high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain
normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%
(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language
models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more
distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight
opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model
ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape
model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging
domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can
help ensure effective development and deployment.

Conclusion: 证明轻量级多模态模型可在现实场景中高效部署，同时保持核心空间推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful
multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on
extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements.
This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments
such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both
efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we
present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly
incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth
cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual
and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts
to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters,
SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial
reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger
alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable
multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial
reasoning capabilities. The code of the experimentation will be available at:

Abstract: We present Lynx, a high-fidelity model for personalized video synthesis from
a single input image. Built on an open-source Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
foundation model, Lynx introduces two lightweight adapters to ensure identity
fidelity. The ID-adapter employs a Perceiver Resampler to convert
ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for
conditioning, while the Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen
reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers
through cross-attention. These modules collectively enable robust identity
preservation while maintaining temporal coherence and visual realism. Through
evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which
yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance,
competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the
state of personalized video generation.

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against
backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches
often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters
responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of
fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior
performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater
interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we
propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism
to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an
\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two
complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through
the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that
jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and
sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner
problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer
problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing
clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains
strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the
proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions
for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化引入表征偏差，尤其在极低比特下性能劣于全精度模型。

Method: 提出最大熵编码量化方法，以最小编码长度为熵的代理，结合专家混合模型实现高效可扩展优化。

Result: 在多个视觉任务上性能超越现有方法，精度媲美甚至超越全精度模型。

Conclusion: MEC-Quant为量化感知训练树立新标杆，有效缓解量化偏差问题。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce
efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances
compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that
quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation,
especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled
objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so
that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to
unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we
propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a
computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a
scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that
not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution
for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on
computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT
is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of
MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells
and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro达60.8%，UI-Vision达30.9%，7B模型性能媲美72B模型。

Conclusion: GUI-ARP显著提升GUI定位精度，具备高效性与强竞争力。

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization
in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel
framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the
proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC),
GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant
regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference
for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is
achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding
benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9%
on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness
against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

Motivation: 现有自回归世界模型因空间结构破坏、解码低效和运动建模不足，难以生成视觉连贯的预测。

Method: 提出SAMPO框架，融合多尺度双向空间注意力、非对称分词器与轨迹感知运动提示模块，实现高效并行解码与动态区域聚焦。

Result: 实验表明SAMPO在动作条件视频预测和基于模型的控制中表现优异，推理速度提升4.4倍，且具备零样本泛化与模型扩展能力。

Conclusion: SAMPO有效解决了现有世界模型的关键缺陷，为长时程决策与物理仿真提供更高效、更真实的模拟能力。

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined
environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However,
existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent
predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and
inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise
\textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt
(\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive
modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame
generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with
bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports
parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both
temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene
understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves
spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations
for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.
Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects
spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on
dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.
Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in
action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving
generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's
zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

TL;DR: 提出对称双向多模态学习框架，提升欲望、情感与情绪识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视图像作为非语言线索，且多模态欲望理解研究不足。

Method: 结合高低分辨率图像建模，引入文本与图像双向引导解码器，实现局部与全局跨模态交互。

Result: 在MSED数据集上F1分数分别提升1.1%、0.6%、0.9%。

Conclusion: 方法有效提升多模态意图相关表征学习能力。

Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to
both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and
emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire
understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis
predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary
non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional
Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,
which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively
capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,
low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for
cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into
sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to
capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an
image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal
interaction at both local and global representations of image information.
Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale
image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into
sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a
multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as
emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent
improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding,
0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis. Our code is

Result: 在MeViS测试集上取得64.14% J&F分数，位列ICCV 2025第七届LSVOS挑战赛RVOS赛道第二名。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可显著提升现有模型性能，有效结合语言与视觉信息。

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a
video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between
vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large
Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning
capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a
training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the
RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language
Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in
the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and
(2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better
capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without
any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the
MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge
at ICCV 2025.

Motivation: 解决野外稀疏多外观图像重建中过平滑与过拟合问题。

Method: 结合单目深度几何先验与SfM锚定语义区域，引入虚拟视图几何监督。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，实现高质量多外观新视图合成。

Conclusion: MS-GS为稀疏多外观场景重建提供了更鲁棒、逼真的解决方案。

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and
exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons,
posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are
prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework
designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using
3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our
approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth
estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions
with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable
alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we
propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a
fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce
overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting
to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves
photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and
multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly
across different datasets.

Conclusion: Diff-Feat能形成更紧密语义聚类，显著提升多模态多标签分类效果。

Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful
representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce
\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate
features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and
fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most
discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the
middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for
language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located
in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across
varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best
performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under
DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that
pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a
few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear
projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields
state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on
Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a
wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that
\textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Conclusion: AI开发与工作流数字化应视为端到端协同设计过程，本文旨在填补实际部署中情境化知识的空白。

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in
paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build
upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to
capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and
workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By
documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address
the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world
AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏显式几何对齐机制，且难以区分真实细微变化与噪声。

Method: 基于ChangeMamba，引入BTDA模块进行语义特征级几何对齐，SSCA模块多源线索增强高置信变化并抑制噪声。

Result: F1-score从0.5730提升至0.5903，IoU从0.4015提升至0.4187，验证方法有效性。

Conclusion: DC-Mamba透明解决几何与特征层面挑战，是鲁棒且易部署的遥感变化检测方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover
changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models
(SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and
struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we
introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the
ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1)
Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric
awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and
(2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to
selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise
before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes
geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA
to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets.
Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong
ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU
from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our
"align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution
that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in
RSCD.

Conclusion: BTL框架有效推动拟人化GUI智能体发展，具备实证支持。

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid
advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning
techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists:
their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI
communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL),
a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human
cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes
interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid
detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye
movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring
cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for
precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms.
Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework:
(1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically
optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward
mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and
outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named
BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both
static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive
benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the
framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测评估指标对不同尺寸目标敏感，大目标主导误差，小目标被忽视，导致评估偏差。

Method: 通过理论推导分解评估项，提出SIEva评估框架与SIOpt优化方法，独立评估各区域并聚合结果，消除尺寸不平衡影响。

Result: 实验表明所提方法有效提升多尺寸目标检测性能，且可无缝集成多种SOD骨干网络。

Conclusion: SIEva与SIOpt能有效缓解尺寸偏差，提升显著目标检测的公平性与实用性。

Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient
Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,
particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly
different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel
perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD
metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation
outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed
into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being
directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the
prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet
potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading
to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this
challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.
The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then
aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size
imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated
optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle
and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad
range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present
generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the
validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments
speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at

methods for detecting fake news. This need arises from the widespread influence
and ease of sharing misinformation, which can lead to significant societal
harm. Current methods often struggle with the dynamic and multimodal nature of
short video content. This paper presents HFN, Heterogeneous Fusion Net, a novel
multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and text data to evaluate
the authenticity of short video content. HFN introduces a Decision Network that
dynamically adjusts modality weights during inference and a Weighted
Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with
incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV
(VEracity on Short Videos) specifically designed for short video fake news
detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV
datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over
state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a robust solution capable of
effectively identifying fake news in the complex landscape of short video
platforms, paving the way for more reliable and comprehensive approaches in
combating misinformation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在高风险、特定领域（如外科手术）中的表现尚未充分探索，需建立专业基准以评估和提升其临床可靠性。

Method: 构建包含21万+视觉问答、1048个细粒度属性、2.5万+医学知识三元组及四项临床推理任务的标注语料库，并基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B开发领域适配模型EyePCR-MLLM。

Conclusion: EyePCR为评估和增强外科视频理解模型的临床可靠性奠定了基础，推动MLLM在真实手术场景中的认知能力发展。

Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable
capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios
like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we
develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery
analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition
across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}.
EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover
1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph
of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded
reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis,
simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain
knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability.
In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B,
achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared
models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and
\textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals
the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation
for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video
understanding models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips
are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this
challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive
benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a
temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated
pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and
stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16
representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis
video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key
insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across
tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Rasa框架，结合病理报告文本与WSI图像，通过自蒸馏和风险感知数据增强提升生存分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WSI生存分析受限于噪声特征与数据不足，未充分利用病理报告中的辅助信息。

Method: 利用LLM提取病理报告文本，设计自蒸馏框架引导学生模型过滤冗余特征，并引入风险感知mix-up增强训练数据。

Result: 在CRC与TCGA-BRCA数据集上优于现有方法，验证了Rasa的有效性。

Conclusion: Rasa有效融合多模态信息，显著提升WSI生存分析性能，具临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for
evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information
essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based
survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility,
hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively.
Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could
assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains
largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary
self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First,
advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained,
WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a
carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is
designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student
model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a
risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student
model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data.
Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data
(TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略噪声样本内在多样性，且采用统一训练策略，导致模型优化效果不佳。

Method: 引入伪标签一致性评分（PCS）区分模糊与可优化样本，结合自适应对优化（APO）策略进行差异化训练。

Result: 在CC152K、MS-COCO和Flickr30K数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升噪声监督下的检索性能。

Conclusion: PCSR能更精细处理噪声数据，提高跨模态检索的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic
similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are
perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These
misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval
performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that
simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic
diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform
training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in
suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above
challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label
Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence
reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.
Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish
clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency
to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label
Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the
separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,
we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are
optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text
replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and
Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval
robustness under noisy supervision.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上显著提升分割性能，增强跨域适应性并降低通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡全局共享与本地个性化，为联邦医学图像分割提供新范式。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet
privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning
addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight
architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities;
however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated
settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM
framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image
segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized
strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client
commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)
component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled
global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm
via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model
and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach
significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain
adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

Conclusion: UNIV有效统一红外与可见光模态感知，为多模态视觉任务提供高性能基础模型。

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GS-Scale 是一种高效内存管理的 3D 高斯泼溅训练系统，可在消费级 GPU 上实现大规模场景训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 3D 高斯泼溅在大规模场景训练中 GPU 内存不足的问题。

Method: 将高斯参数存于主机内存，按需传输至 GPU，并结合三项系统优化：几何参数选择性卸载、参数前向流水线、延迟优化器更新。

Result: GPU 内存占用降低 3.3-5.6 倍，训练速度媲美全 GPU 方案，RTX 4070 Mobile 上高斯数量可从 400 万扩至 1800 万，LPIPS 提升 23-35%。

Conclusion: GS-Scale 实现了高效、可扩展的 3D 高斯泼溅训练，显著降低硬件门槛。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by
delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training
large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial
memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,
which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we
propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a
subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this
dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and
optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's
limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three
system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters
for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer
updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize
unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive
evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly
lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds
comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the
number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,
leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)
improvement.

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless
fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still
lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless
fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D
fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless
fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by
integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for
contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint
reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the
first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of
contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera
parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,
reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and
reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates
high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the
performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for
mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an
important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning
process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface
due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in
incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and
successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we
present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface
reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to
estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available
point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in
our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas
with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to
effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we
demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in
data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces,
outperforming existing methodologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在物体边界处深度模糊，需精细监督才能改善，本文旨在仅用自监督解决此问题。

Method: 将像素深度建模为混合分布，利用方差感知损失与不确定性传播整合进现有流程。

Result: 在KITTI与VKITTIv2上边界锐度提升达35%，点云质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升自监督单目深度估计的边界精度与3D重建质量。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding,
but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing
spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires
very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities
using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a
mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting
uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation
integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions
and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show
that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point
cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel
view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a
camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D
points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats.
View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the
camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the
point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.
Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views
demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena,
including intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.

Conclusion: 结合字布局与多尺度风格特征的条件扩散模型能有效提升手写笔画生成的风格一致性与真实性。

Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of
tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In
handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the
sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the
calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word
spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in
inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes
multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These
multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.
Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word
spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional
diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly
generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal
coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our
proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by
calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke
generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed
diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and
is competitive with recent image generation networks.

Motivation: 现有基于局部区域的方法依赖复杂定位网络，存在特征冗余且难以量化所需部件数量，限制了下游任务的特征利用。

Method: 先提取外围粗略特征生成采样图，再并行编码注视区域，使用上下文选择性注意力融合特征，并通过非极大值抑制消除空间冗余。

Result: 在多个标准细粒度数据集及昆虫数据集上性能媲美SOTA，且稳定优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决细粒度分类中的空间冗余与特征利用率问题，具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

Result: 在ModelNet、ScanObjNN等多个基准上显著提升性能，并增强空间推理与跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: SceneForge是一种模型无关的通用框架，有效推动3D-文本对比学习发展。

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive
learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive
alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object
scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct
multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent
multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting
contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge
effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets,
significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically
investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per
scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene
construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge
delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including
zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet,
as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's
compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving
performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge
improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to
retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial
reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely
with textual instructions.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在物体与上下文不匹配时容易出错，需系统评估其识别缺陷。

Method: 采用LLM引导采样识别不合情境的物体，CLIP引导采样检测易被幻觉的不存在物体，构建ORIC基准。

Result: 测试18个LVLM与2个开放词汇检测模型，发现其在不协调情境下存在显著识别缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究揭示LVLM对上下文敏感度不足，呼吁加强情境感知的物体识别研究。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image
caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and
textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous
contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually
expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification
and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the
Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark
that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate
from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,
which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)

Motivation: 现有方法处理高分辨率图像时计算开销过大，需更高效方案。

Method: PTP策略结合区域与令牌级视觉显著性及指令引导重要性，选择性保留关键令牌。

Result: 在13个基准测试中显著降低计算开销与延迟，性能损失极小。

Conclusion: PTP有效提升LVLMs处理高分辨率图像的效率，兼顾性能与速度。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal
understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution
images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple
sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing
exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token
Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and
token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human
visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually
salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens
most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: 该框架为业务化云相廓线反演提供有效解决方案，未来可集成至NWP系统以提升云微物理模拟精度。

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as
they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this
study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming
multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures,
aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration
with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal
observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band
visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,
and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar
(CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of
synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a
supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D
cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with
several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all
designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is
evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior
performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer
and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision
of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617,
significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

Method: 构建涵盖六种模态、十二种生成模型的MedForensics数据集，提出DSKI检测器，包含CDFA与MFRM两个核心模块。

Result: 实验表明DSKI在多种医学影像模态上检测准确率优于现有方法和人类专家。

Conclusion: DSKI为AI生成医学影像检测提供有效工具，推动医学影像安全与取证研究发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both
significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake
medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose
serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and
misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats
remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets
specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic
methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are
inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of
AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
\textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six
medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We
also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage
\textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language
feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI
comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for
extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during
training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts
detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods
and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical
modalities.

Conclusion: TrueMoE有效解决了合成图像检测中泛化难的问题

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an
increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a
single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content.
However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling
to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE,
a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that
reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple
specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is
a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of
manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to
be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a
granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively
assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across
a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior
generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: 该方法深化了对感受野参数间关系的理解，兼具计算效率提升与理论建模价值。

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

Conclusion: FloorSAM能有效提升平面图重建精度并恢复房间拓扑关系。

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor
navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric
algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,
limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a
framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using
grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we
create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for
precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.
Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,
followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and
regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room
topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better
accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy
and complex settings. Code and materials: github.com/Silentbarber/FloorSAM.

Result: 引入中央凹视觉特性后，模型所学物体表征质量显著提升，归因于物体在视野中显得更大，且中心与周边信息取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究使人类视觉表征学习模型更贴近真实生理机制，同时提升性能。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic
object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of
toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with
high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we
investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object
representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the
visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models
of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that
the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting
sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models
that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling
aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object
representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement
comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between
central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step
towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more
realistic and performant.

Result: 多光谱模态显著缓解性能下降，证明其增强检测鲁棒性的价值。

Conclusion: MCOD为多光谱伪装目标检测研究提供坚实基础，推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend
seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their
performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral
imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative
for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD
benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for
multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address
this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset
specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD
features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It
captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme
lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world
scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better
reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:
Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding
challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on
MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.
Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this
degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing
detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for
future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized
sampling, biodiversity assessment, long-term monitoring and remote, large-scale
surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in
size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The
integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists,
helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To
evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new
test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million
individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models
pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled)
multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant
species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label
training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data,
the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants
and the results achieved.

Result: 在GPTeval3D基准上，VLM3D在语义保真度、几何连贯性与空间正确性显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VLM3D有效解决SDS框架语义与空间缺陷，推动文本到3D生成质量提升。

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation
by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,
using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt
and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two
fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads
to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)
2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in
geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object
scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D
generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into
the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard
text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded
supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their
inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which
significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves
relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the
open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.
Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D
significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,
geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

Conclusion: 该方法实用高效，适用于任何预训练VLM，计算开销极小。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone
to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or
significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using
tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.
By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters
adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and
Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\%
performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On
COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%.
Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual
strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,
plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications

further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant,
achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle
diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional
approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform
smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying
deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,
we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements
anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation
patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into
anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains
are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized
partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global
deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%
Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms
existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios
(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our
SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on
segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a
segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript
acceptance.

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and
generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source
models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We
present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially
reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated
training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters
that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete
tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified
autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image
tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image
tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe
over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both
capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,
and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich
evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from
scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

Conclusion: CBPNet是一种参数高效且有效的持续学习框架，能显著缓解边缘设备上模型的可塑性衰减问题。

Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that
require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual
learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention.
In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a
mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach
introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's
ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the
limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in
plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters
during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual
Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient
framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively
integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by
adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results
on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong
baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of
the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional
parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating
our approach.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change
detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD
datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and
a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully
support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current
approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a
post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further
improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new
benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the
dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more
fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved
roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)
method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and
backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model
collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its
ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal
interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction
Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the
model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,
JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive
results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,
and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督场景下模型泛化能力研究不足，现有方法依赖域标签，而现实常无此信息。

Result: 在多个无监督域泛化基准上超越现有方法，无需类别或域标签。

Conclusion: 从信息论角度证明该表示优化可降低分布外风险，为无监督泛化提供理论与实践新方案。

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in
supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed
to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised
learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the
challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.
Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,
such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,
we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a
Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves
all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)
maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We
theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information
theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency
and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we
implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a
learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve
sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel
semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism
for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new
state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,
consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or
domain labels during representation learning.

Result: 在LoveDA、iSAID和WHU-CD三个基准上超越零样本SAM和专用模型，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 领域自适应增强可有效提升基础模型在遥感分割任务中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to
generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex
terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we
introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed
specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM
integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter
that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures
land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances
fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our
approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing
benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and
task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight
the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a
scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

Motivation: 解决视频理解中计算不可行与语义关键帧识别困难的问题。

Method: 提出可微关键帧选择机制，结合TAD三阶段筛选与KF-GRPO对比学习奖励机制。

Result: 在VideoMME达69.1%，LVBench达52.7%，7B模型媲美72B模型性能。

Conclusion: ChronoForge-RL在效率与精度上均显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with
two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing
every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying
semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In
this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called
ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and
KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these
issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism
that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage
process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal
information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective
temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection
detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.
Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm
with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models
to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our
proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench
compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while
enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B
parameter alternatives.

Conclusion: CIDER为生成更原创、公平的内容提供实用方案，推动可信生成式AI发展。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand
bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands
from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a
novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through
prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector
to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score
(BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I
models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit
biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a
practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the
development of trustworthy generative AI.

Result: 在计算机视觉和冷冻电镜任务中实验验证方法高效有效。

Conclusion: 数据不确定性与任务损失上界相关，所提方法具备通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing
methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to
estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and
hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron
Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost
uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode
where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model
that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL
cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure
uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not
rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method
suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data
uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to
the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the
proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The
results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在稀疏实地数据下易产生碎片化预测，需引入对象级分类提升地图连贯性。

Method: 提出LC-SLab框架，支持输入级（图神经网络）与输出级（后处理分割模型）聚合，并融合预训练网络特征。

Result: 在Sentinel-2与LUCAS数据上验证，对象方法精度媲美或超越像素模型，地图更连贯；输入级适合小数据，输出级适合大数据。

Conclusion: LC-SLab有效提升稀疏监督下土地覆盖制图质量，具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical
role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets
from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual
annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage
often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep
learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address
this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically
coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a
minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain
underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially
in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address
this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for
systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale
land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both
input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation
by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.
Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to
improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual
Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our
results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of
common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.
Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas
output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations
of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the
framework's practical utility.

Result: 实验表明GVR在避免逐场景训练的同时达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GVR为零样本3D视觉定位研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text
prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However,
existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to
handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require
larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose
\underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel
zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D
retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding
clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D
annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual
grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid
foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in

Conclusion: ENSAM在无预训练权重方法中表现最佳，验证了相对位置编码与Muon优化器的有效性。

Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a

ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder
in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative
positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training.
ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and
computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from
multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB
GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D
Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set
with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of
2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously
published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol),
surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three
metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall
and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation
studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon
optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation
quality.

Method: 采用双路径对比学习构建几何语义融合嵌入空间，结合粗配准（超点-超像素对应）与精配准（几何约束点级优化），并引入动态训练机制平衡多任务损失。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上分别超越SOTA方法23.7%和37.9%。

Conclusion: CrossI2P有效弥合2D/3D模态鸿沟，显著提升自动驾驶感知系统的配准性能。

Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in
autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains
challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but
depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well
as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that
unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end
pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via
dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional
alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine
registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel
correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction
modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise
registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient
normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence
refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry
benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and
robustness.

Method: 提出RACap模型，从检索描述中挖掘结构化关系语义，并从图像中识别异构对象，结合异构视觉信息增强表达。

Result: 实验表明，RACap仅用10.8M参数即优于先前轻量级模型。

Conclusion: RACap有效解决了现有检索增强图像描述方法在关系建模上的不足，性能优越且参数高效。

Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external
knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes.
However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the
representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture
fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image
objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we
propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning,
which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but
also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively
retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual
information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.
Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters,
achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning
models.

Conclusion: 基于视觉基础模型的范围视图分割方法具有广阔前景，为统一的、基础模型驱动的LiDAR分割开辟新路径。

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene
understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research
due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular
memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view
methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic
segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the
rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot
recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current
state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for
LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our
knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,
coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard
projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for
range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to
the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies
inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to
the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism
in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial
patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach
achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the
speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This
work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D
perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR
segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods
using VFMs leads to promising results.

Motivation: 现有迭代算法在遮挡、无纹理或重复纹理区域缺乏全局上下文与几何信息，导致性能受限。

Method: 设计空间注意力、匹配注意力与体素注意力模块，集成到现有迭代方法中，构建GREAT-Stereo框架。

Result: GREAT-IGEV在Scene Flow、KITTI 2015、ETH3D排名第一，Middlebury排名第二。

Conclusion: GREAT框架通用有效，显著提升立体匹配在困难区域的性能。

Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like
RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed
regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of
global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To
enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we
propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)
framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial
Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension,
Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and
Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more
robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify
the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into
several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it
through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This
framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.
Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first
on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves
second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that
combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This
feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures,
enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of
biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation
solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to
ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two
key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In
both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform
their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes.
In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust
against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the
importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning.

a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has
traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories,
which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object
detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a
limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is
training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models
instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring
3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D
proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the
extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard
benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful
baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely
sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view
setting.

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar
fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and
lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to
find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new
architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as
accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and
radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of
radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is
introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A
self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between
the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the
FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures
with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this
modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object
detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50,
while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset
for the same category.

Result: 在Sentinel-1/2与Landsat-8上MAPE达0.336/0.331/0.353，优于7种现有方法。

Conclusion: 模型显著提升预测精度，助力农民优化决策、提高产量。

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and
food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by
affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm
management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in
overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data
analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal
data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral
data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To
resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield
Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with
spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and
dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained
models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive
learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing
spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing
data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of
the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.
MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,
and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield
prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The
outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and
provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,
potentially improving crop yields.

Result: Saliency Maps适合轻量模型，Integrated Gradients适合深层模型；Attribution Fidelity能有效识别不可靠解释，优于传统指标。

Conclusion: Attribution Fidelity为MDE模型可解释性提供更可靠评估手段，有助于推动可信赖深度估计系统的发展。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand
the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

Motivation: 单一语义目标在视觉持续学习中易引发语义歧义与类内视觉多样性表达不足的问题。

Method: 利用轻量级LLM代理生成多语义原型，结合LogSumExp机制实现图像与最相关原型的自适应对齐。

Result: 在多个持续学习基准上，MuproCL均表现出一致的性能与鲁棒性提升。

Conclusion: MuproCL为语言引导的持续学习提供了一种更有效的实现路径。

Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a
Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual
Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two
critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name
results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual
diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual
appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework
that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category
disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic
prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to
adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive
experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently
enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for
language-guided continual learning.

Result: 在公开数据集上，DistillMatch优于现有算法。

Conclusion: DistillMatch有效提升多模态匹配性能与泛化能力，为跨模态感知与分析提供新方案。

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of
different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis.
However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this
task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets,
existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for
matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision
Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and
robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities,
including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal
image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch
employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that
extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to
assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it
extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's
features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.
Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by
translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation.
Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public
datasets.

Result: 实验表明CauMVC在完全和部分对齐数据上均具强泛化性和有效性。

Conclusion: CauMVC为广义多视图聚类提供新思路，首次将因果学习引入该领域并取得显著效果。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure
across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption
of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across
different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often
present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across
different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,
we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order
shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view
clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view
clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to
understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the
partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with
partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining
invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational
Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing
information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed
to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive
regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal
learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data
illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

Result: 在LRS2、LRS3及新中文数据集上性能超越现有方法，展现更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GLip有效利用局部判别区域，显著提升复杂环境下唇读准确率。

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of
recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR
over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world
visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and
pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local
Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon
two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between
visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content
facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech
mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain
local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues
for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path
feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features
within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the
model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding
acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a
coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a
Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features
with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,
refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our
framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive
learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual
challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3
benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced
challenging Mandarin dataset.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了噪声点云曲面重建中对法线依赖和控制点数量固定的问题，提升了重建精度与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a
fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are
inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing
data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth
normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency
makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the
availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the
case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface
representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening
properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using
B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline
control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of
a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very
difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we
develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface
reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and
the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth
surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction
method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing
widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all
of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 定量与定性实验均显示该方法在GAD任务中性能优越。

Conclusion: 语言引导推理有效提升群体活动检测的准确率与语义理解能力。

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members
and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing
deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,
transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic
dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on
implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual
reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel
framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by
introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>
tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and
language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained
commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>
tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities
and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.
Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the
<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,
we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates
MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual
features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in GAD taks.

Conclusion: SEE&TREK为提升多模态大模型的空间智能提供了一条高效且易集成的新路径。

Abstract: We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored
to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated
modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely
visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap
by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion
reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness
Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract
semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion
reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial
positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal
coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward
pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive
experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently
boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with
the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial
intelligence.

Conclusion: 该方法是高效实用的自监督真实图像去噪方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised
framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major
challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often
sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial
independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to
self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that
combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a
conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To
enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to
guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local
details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective
self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models

Conclusion: AdaSports-Traj能有效建模体育轨迹中的异构分布，提升跨角色与跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently
challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g.,
players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports
domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured
distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and
domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework
that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution
discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and
Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on
agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical
Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and
domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures
without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports
datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and
cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

Conclusion: SegDINO3D 有效结合 2D 知识显著提升 3D 实例分割性能，尤其在数据稀缺场景优势突出。

Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder
framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as
sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D
representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both
image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.
SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In
the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image
features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for
3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D
anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries
obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries
serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively
avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory
while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The
introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate
cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D
instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200
dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP
on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its
superiority.

Method: 设计点高斯编码器（PGE）与3D高斯光栅化生成稠密特征图，提出框高斯损失（BGL）实现一致优化。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet与View-of-Delft数据集上达到SOTA精度，推理速度大幅提升。

Conclusion: RadarGaussianDet3D适合自动驾驶实时部署，兼顾精度与效率。

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving
due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement
capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on
pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to
only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded
representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes
independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their
inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the
real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these
limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely
RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and
distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding
boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed
to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and
employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,
yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to
the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of
3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts
bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to
enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on
TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves
state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster
inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous
driving.

Conclusion: 本文不仅提供顶尖MRM模型，更为社区提供实证支持的开发指南，助力下一代MLLM对齐人类偏好。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made
aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs)
are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for
building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking
in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this
paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance
MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM
development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,
Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head
architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering
over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model}
and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a
powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward
adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,
featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully
curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our
results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as
MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,
outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility
beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world
reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance
across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not
only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with
a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the
next generation of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用低分辨率但宽视场的ToF传感器，以极少量测量重建3D场景。

Method: 采用前馈预测推断场景参数，结合可微渲染的分析合成框架进行优化。

Result: 在仿真与真实环境中成功恢复已知物体6D姿态，对其他参数化场景亦有初步成效。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏测量下有效，展示了低成本ToF传感器在3D重建中的潜力。

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth
measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.
These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but
image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data
in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes
rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse
measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few
measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple
parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a
known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both
feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering
within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter
estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method
effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both
simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial
results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to
explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

Motivation: 现有文本生成图像模型难以准确呈现以动作为核心的复杂语义场景，缺乏上下文细节。

Method: 构建评测基准AcT2I，并采用无需训练的知识蒸馏技术，通过大语言模型增强提示词，注入时序等密集信息。

Result: 最佳模型在AcT2I上生成准确率提升72%，显著改善动作场景的语义还原能力。

Conclusion: 当前T2I模型在复杂推理场景中存在局限，系统性融入语言知识可有效提升生成图像的语境准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in
generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist
in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the
primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models
frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent
in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual
details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from
action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do
not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises
from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual
dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this
by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large
Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by
incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that
injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation
accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings
highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that
require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge
in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and
contextually accurate images.

TL;DR: 本文提出Sycophantic Reflective Tuning（SRT）方法，有效缓解多模态大模型在图像输入下的视觉谄媚行为，同时避免过度固执。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大模型在处理图像时表现出明显的视觉谄媚行为，影响对话可靠性，需加以缓解。

Method: 提出SRT方法，使模型在回应前先判断用户指令是误导性还是纠正性，再进行反思推理。

Result: 应用SRT后，模型对误导指令的谄媚行为显著减少，且不会对纠正指令过度固执。

Conclusion: SRT有效平衡了模型在应对误导与纠正指令时的行为，提升了多模态对话系统的稳健性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary
capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we
observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.
While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models
(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image
inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To
better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to
the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we
first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist
misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also
makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even
if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective
Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,
allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or
corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a
significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,
without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective
instructions.

Motivation: 解决Otsu算法因穷举搜索导致的计算效率低下问题。

Method: 利用类间方差函数的单峰性，采用二分法进行阈值搜索。

Conclusion: 该优化在不牺牲分割质量前提下，显著提升运算效率，适用于实时大规模图像处理。

Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image
segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by
exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work
presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to
exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.
Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)
evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on
48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance
computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to
conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold
matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5
gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical
logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees
suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical
computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without
compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the
original Otsu method.

Result: 在脑肿瘤、RGB-D语义与显著目标分割任务中，多种缺失模态场景下性能显著超越SOTA。

Conclusion: UniMRSeg为多模态缺失分割提供统一高效方案，降低部署成本并提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from
incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods
address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination
models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model
subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified
modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical
self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges
representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,
feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the
hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the
intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for
missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant
contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among
incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight
reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual
semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid
consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality
combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and
whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under
diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D
semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be
released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.

TL;DR: SBP通过合成新语料提升语言模型预训练效果，超越传统单文档因果建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练未有效利用文档间关联，SBP旨在挖掘并利用这些关联提升性能。

Method: 先学习文档间关系模型，再合成新语料联合训练，隐含贝叶斯抽象概念机制。

Result: 在同等算力下，SBP显著优于重复基线，逼近20倍数据量的理论上限性能。

Conclusion: SBP有效提升模型表现，合成文本非简单改写，而是基于核心概念重构叙述。

Abstract: We introduce Synthetic Bootstrapped Pretraining (SBP), a language model (LM)
pretraining procedure that first learns a model of relations between documents
from the pretraining dataset and then leverages it to synthesize a vast new
corpus for joint training. While the standard pretraining teaches LMs to learn
causal correlations among tokens within a single document, it is not designed
to efficiently model the rich, learnable inter-document correlations that can
potentially lead to better performance. We validate SBP by designing a
compute-matched pretraining setup and pretrain a 3B-parameter model on up to 1T
tokens from scratch. We find SBP consistently improves upon a strong repetition
baseline and delivers a significant fraction of performance improvement
attainable by an oracle upper bound with access to 20x more unique data.
Qualitative analysis reveals that the synthesized documents go beyond mere
paraphrases -- SBP first abstracts a core concept from the seed material and
then crafts a new narration on top of it. Besides strong empirical performance,
SBP admits a natural Bayesian interpretation: the synthesizer implicitly learns
to abstract the latent concepts shared between related documents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宗喀语作为低资源语言，缺乏适配的分词器，限制了其NLP发展，亟需针对性研究。

Method: 比较BPE、WordPiece和SentencePiece三种算法，使用子词丰度、连续词比例、归一化序列长度和执行时间等指标评估性能。

Result: SentencePiece在宗喀语上表现最优，优于其他两种算法。

Conclusion: 低资源语言需定制化分词方案，SentencePiece为宗喀语NLP和大模型开发提供有效支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity and improving rapidly.
Tokenizers are crucial components of natural language processing, especially
for LLMs. Tokenizers break down input text into tokens that models can easily
process while ensuring the text is accurately represented, capturing its
meaning and structure. Effective tokenizers enhance the capabilities of LLMs by
improving a model's understanding of context and semantics, ultimately leading
to better performance in various downstream tasks, such as translation,
classification, sentiment analysis, and text generation. Most pre-trained
tokenizers are suitable for high-resource languages like English but perform
poorly for low-resource languages. Dzongkha, Bhutan's national language spoken
by around seven hundred thousand people, is a low-resource language, and its
linguistic complexity poses unique NLP challenges. Despite some progress,
significant research in Dzongkha NLP is lacking, particularly in tokenization.
This study evaluates the training and performance of three common tokenization
algorithms in comparison to other popular methods. Specifically, Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, and SentencePiece (Unigram) were evaluated for their
suitability for Dzongkha. Performance was assessed using metrics like Subword
Fertility, Proportion of Continued Words, Normalized Sequence Length, and
execution time. The results show that while all three algorithms demonstrate
potential, SentencePiece is the most effective for Dzongkha tokenization,
paving the way for further NLP advancements. This underscores the need for
tailored approaches for low-resource languages and ongoing research. In this
study, we presented three tokenization algorithms for Dzongkha, paving the way
for building Dzongkha Large Language Models.

Method: 采用红队测试方法，在对话、问答与内容生成三种真实场景中系统探测模型漏洞，并对主流多语言LLM进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验揭示当前多语言LLM在安全防护机制上存在严重不足，尤其在处理本地语言与文化语境时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 本研究为构建更安全、更具文化包容性的多语言AI系统奠定基础，强调需针对本地语言与文化特性优化毒性内容过滤机制。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed natural
language processing; however, their safety mechanisms remain under-explored in
low-resource, multilingual settings. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In
particular, we introduce \textsf{SGToxicGuard}, a novel dataset and evaluation
framework for benchmarking LLM safety in Singapore's diverse linguistic
context, including Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. SGToxicGuard adopts a
red-teaming approach to systematically probe LLM vulnerabilities in three
real-world scenarios: \textit{conversation}, \textit{question-answering}, and
\textit{content composition}. We conduct extensive experiments with
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs, and the results uncover critical gaps in
their safety guardrails. By offering actionable insights into cultural
sensitivity and toxicity mitigation, we lay the foundation for safer and more
inclusive AI systems in linguistically diverse environments.\footnote{Link to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要客观评估的应用中可能因政治偏见而失效，尤其在事实核查任务中影响尚不明确。

Method: 构建语义相同但政治内涵不同的最小对陈述，评估六个大语言模型对其真假判断的一致性，并测试提示中强调客观性是否缓解偏见。

Result: 判断性词汇显著影响模型的真实性评估，少数模型显示政治偏见倾向，但提示强调客观性未能有效缓解。

Conclusion: 政治偏见对大语言模型事实核查的影响有限，判断性词汇的作用更关键，需改进模型对语义细微差别的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in applications requiring
objective assessment, which could be compromised by political bias. Many
studies found preferences for left-leaning positions in LLMs, but downstream
effects on tasks like fact-checking remain underexplored. In this study, we
systematically investigate political bias through exchanging words with
euphemisms or dysphemisms in German claims. We construct minimal pairs of
factually equivalent claims that differ in political connotation, to assess the
consistency of LLMs in classifying them as true or false. We evaluate six LLMs
and find that, more than political leaning, the presence of judgmental words
significantly influences truthfulness assessment. While a few models show
tendencies of political bias, this is not mitigated by explicitly calling for
objectivism in prompts.

Result: SCAO在减少问题线索时表现稳定优异，更贴近真实自省。

Conclusion: 现有性能多依赖问题模式，SCAO能更好促进LLM真正的自我意识。

Abstract: Hallucination prediction in large language models (LLMs) is often interpreted
as a sign of self-awareness. However, we argue that such performance can arise
from question-side shortcuts rather than true model-side introspection. To
disentangle these factors, we propose the Approximate Question-side Effect
(AQE), which quantifies the contribution of question-awareness. Our analysis
across multiple datasets reveals that much of the reported success stems from
exploiting superficial patterns in questions. We further introduce SCAO
(Semantic Compression by Answering in One word), a method that enhances the use
of model-side signals. Experiments show that SCAO achieves strong and
consistent performance, particularly in settings with reduced question-side
cues, highlighting its effectiveness in fostering genuine self-awareness in
LLMs.

Result: 在五个大模型和六个领域实验中，HERO平均提升2.5-3 mAP，超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: HERO有效实现对不同长度和类型机器影响文本的精准检测，提升应用场景安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLMs) can be used to write or modify documents,
presenting a challenge for understanding the intent behind their use. For
example, benign uses may involve using LLM on a human-written document to
improve its grammar or to translate it into another language. However, a
document entirely produced by a LLM may be more likely to be used to spread
misinformation than simple translation (\eg, from use by malicious actors or
simply by hallucinating). Prior works in Machine Generated Text (MGT) detection
mostly focus on simply identifying whether a document was human or machine
written, ignoring these fine-grained uses. In this paper, we introduce a
HiErarchical, length-RObust machine-influenced text detector (HERO), which
learns to separate text samples of varying lengths from four primary types:
human-written, machine-generated, machine-polished, and machine-translated.
HERO accomplishes this by combining predictions from length-specialist models
that have been trained with Subcategory Guidance. Specifically, for categories
that are easily confused (\eg, different source languages), our Subcategory
Guidance module encourages separation of the fine-grained categories, boosting
performance. Extensive experiments across five LLMs and six domains demonstrate
the benefits of our HERO, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 2.5-3 mAP on
average.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown substantial capabilities
in integrating visual and textual information, yet frequently rely on spurious
correlations, undermining their robustness and generalization in complex
multimodal reasoning tasks. This paper addresses the critical challenge of
superficial correlation bias in MLLMs through a novel causal mediation-based
debiasing framework. Specially, we distinguishing core semantics from spurious
textual and visual contexts via counterfactual examples to activate
training-stage debiasing and employ a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with dynamic routing to selectively engages modality-specific debiasing
experts. Empirical evaluation on multimodal sarcasm detection and sentiment
analysis tasks demonstrates that our framework significantly surpasses unimodal

Result: 在四种低资源语言上显著降低WER，最高达14.3%，对高资源语言也有效。

Conclusion: 方法仅依赖原始标注数据，具广泛适用性，尤其适合数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces three self-contained data augmentation methods for
low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Our techniques first generate
novel text--using gloss-based replacement, random replacement, or an LLM-based
approach--and then apply Text-to-Speech (TTS) to produce synthetic audio. We
apply these methods, which leverage only the original annotated data, to four
languages with extremely limited resources (Vatlongos, Nashta, Shinekhen
Buryat, and Kakabe). Fine-tuning a pretrained Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 model on a
combination of the original audio and generated synthetic data yields
significant performance gains, including a 14.3% absolute WER reduction for
Nashta. The methods prove effective across all four low-resource languages and
also show utility for high-resource languages like English, demonstrating their
broad applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对大语言模型自然语言解释的有效不确定性量化方法，而这对理解解释的可信度至关重要。

Method: 提出新颖的后验、模型无关不确定性估计框架，并设计抗噪鲁棒方法。

Result: 在问答任务上的实验表明，所提方法表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效量化自然语言解释的不确定性，尤其在含噪医疗问答场景中具备鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities, enabling
concise, context-aware answers in question answering (QA) tasks. The lack of
transparency in complex LLMs has inspired extensive research aimed at
developing methods to explain large language behaviors. Among existing
explanation methods, natural language explanations stand out due to their
ability to explain LLMs in a self-explanatory manner and enable the
understanding of model behaviors even when the models are closed-source.
However, despite these promising advancements, there is no existing work
studying how to provide valid uncertainty guarantees for these generated
natural language explanations. Such uncertainty quantification is critical in
understanding the confidence behind these explanations. Notably, generating
valid uncertainty estimates for natural language explanations is particularly
challenging due to the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs and the
presence of noise in medical inquiries. To bridge this gap, in this work, we
first propose a novel uncertainty estimation framework for these generated
natural language explanations, which provides valid uncertainty guarantees in a
post-hoc and model-agnostic manner. Additionally, we also design a novel robust
uncertainty estimation method that maintains valid uncertainty guarantees even
under noise. Extensive experiments on QA tasks demonstrate the desired
performance of our methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仓库级代码补全方法存在查询构建不当、单路径检索及检索器与LLM不匹配等问题。

Method: 提出CodeRAG框架，包含概率引导查询构建、多路径代码检索和BestFit偏好对齐重排序。

Result: 在ReccEval和CCEval基准上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CodeRAG有效解决了仓库级代码补全的关键问题，性能优越且开源可用。

Abstract: Repository-level code completion automatically predicts the unfinished code
based on the broader information from the repository. Recent strides in Code
Large Language Models (code LLMs) have spurred the development of
repository-level code completion methods, yielding promising results.
Nevertheless, they suffer from issues such as inappropriate query construction,
single-path code retrieval, and misalignment between code retriever and code
LLM. To address these problems, we introduce CodeRAG, a framework tailored to
identify relevant and necessary knowledge for retrieval-augmented
repository-level code completion. Its core components include log probability
guided query construction, multi-path code retrieval, and preference-aligned
BestFit reranking. Extensive experiments on benchmarks ReccEval and CCEval
demonstrate that CodeRAG significantly and consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of CodeRAG is available at

Motivation: 医学领域文本摘要对自动化工具需求增长，但因数据敏感和稀缺，现有通用模型难以直接适用。

Method: 使用PEGASUS与PEGASUS-X模型，在中等规模放射报告数据集上进行不同检查点和数据量的微调实验，并监控验证集表现。

Result: PEGASUS呈现epoch-wise双下降现象，PEGASUS-X大检查点反而性能下降，表明高表达力模型在小数据下易过拟合。

Conclusion: 在数据稀缺的专业领域微调高表达力模型存在风险，需更稳健的微调策略。

Abstract: Regardless of the rapid development of artificial intelligence, abstractive
summarisation is still challenging for sensitive and data-restrictive domains
like medicine. With the increasing number of imaging, the relevance of
automated tools for complex medical text summarisation is expected to become
highly relevant. In this paper, we investigated the adaptation via fine-tuning
process of a non-domain-specific abstractive summarisation encoder-decoder
model family, and gave insights to practitioners on how to avoid over- and
underfitting. We used PEGASUS and PEGASUS-X, on a medium-sized radiological
reports public dataset. For each model, we comprehensively evaluated two
different checkpoints with varying sizes of the same training data. We
monitored the models' performances with lexical and semantic metrics during the
training history on the fixed-size validation set. PEGASUS exhibited different
phases, which can be related to epoch-wise double-descent, or
peak-drop-recovery behaviour. For PEGASUS-X, we found that using a larger
checkpoint led to a performance detriment. This work highlights the challenges
and risks of fine-tuning models with high expressivity when dealing with scarce
training data, and lays the groundwork for future investigations into more
robust fine-tuning strategies for summarisation models in specialised domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音自监督方法在标签质量与计算效率间难以兼顾，需一种兼顾高效与强标签的方案。

Method: 利用模型自身中间表征经随机投影量化生成增强标签，结合原始输入锚定标签，通过可微Gumbel-Softmax实现端到端双层优化。

Result: 在LibriSpeech、AMI、YODAS等数据集上持续优于BEST-RQ，同时保持低复杂度与高效率。

Conclusion: BiRQ有效平衡了标签质量与训练效率，为语音自监督学习提供了一种更优的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Speech is a rich signal, and labeled audio-text pairs are costly, making
self-supervised learning essential for scalable representation learning. A core
challenge in speech SSL is generating pseudo-labels that are both informative
and efficient: strong labels, such as those used in HuBERT, improve downstream
performance but rely on external encoders and multi-stage pipelines, while
efficient methods like BEST-RQ achieve simplicity at the cost of weaker labels.
We propose BiRQ, a bilevel SSL framework that combines the efficiency of
BEST-RQ with the refinement benefits of HuBERT-style label enhancement. The key
idea is to reuse part of the model itself as a pseudo-label generator:
intermediate representations are discretized by a random-projection quantizer
to produce enhanced labels, while anchoring labels derived directly from the
raw input stabilize training and prevent collapse. Training is formulated as an
efficient first-order bilevel optimization problem, solved end-to-end with
differentiable Gumbel-softmax selection. This design eliminates the need for
external label encoders, reduces memory cost, and enables iterative label
refinement in an end-to-end fashion. BiRQ consistently improves over BEST-RQ
while maintaining low complexity and computational efficiency. We validate our
method on various datasets, including 960-hour LibriSpeech, 150-hour AMI
meetings and 5,000-hour YODAS, demonstrating consistent gains over BEST-RQ.

Conclusion: 混合方法在多样性与一致性间取得最佳平衡，且各方法质量无显著差异。

Abstract: Generative AI applications commonly leverage user personas as a steering
mechanism for synthetic data generation, but reliance on natural language
representations forces models to make unintended inferences about which
attributes to emphasize, limiting precise control over outputs. We introduce
PILOT (Psychological and Linguistic Output Targeting), a two-phase framework
for steering large language models with structured psycholinguistic profiles.
In Phase 1, PILOT translates natural language persona descriptions into
multidimensional profiles with normalized scores across linguistic and
psychological dimensions. In Phase 2, these profiles guide generation along
measurable axes of variation. We evaluate PILOT across three state-of-the-art
LLMs (Mistral Large 2, Deepseek-R1, LLaMA 3.3 70B) using 25 synthetic personas
under three conditions: Natural-language Persona Steering (NPS), Schema-Based
Steering (SBS), and Hybrid Persona-Schema Steering (HPS). Results demonstrate
that schema-based approaches significantly reduce artificial-sounding persona
repetition while improving output coherence, with silhouette scores increasing
from 0.098 to 0.237 and topic purity from 0.773 to 0.957. Our analysis reveals
a fundamental trade-off: SBS produces more concise outputs with higher topical
consistency, while NPS offers greater lexical diversity but reduced
predictability. HPS achieves a balance between these extremes, maintaining
output variety while preserving structural consistency. Expert linguistic
evaluation confirms that PILOT maintains high response quality across all
conditions, with no statistically significant differences between steering
approaches.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大语言模型和多模态大语言模型在英语和中文数据集上的讽刺检测能力，发现音频模态表现最佳，且多模态融合效果更优，凸显MLLMs在跨语言多模态讽刺理解中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺检测依赖跨模态线索，而现有研究多集中于文本或视觉-文本，音频-视觉-文本的综合理解仍待探索。

Method: 在零样本、少样本及LoRA微调设置下评估LLMs和MLLMs，同时将模型作为特征编码器，通过协同门控融合模块整合多模态表示。

Result: 音频模态单模态表现最强，文本-音频和音频-视觉组合优于单模态与三模态模型，Qwen-Omni等MLLMs在零样本和微调下表现优异。

Conclusion: MLLMs在跨语言、音频-视觉-文本的讽刺理解任务中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Sarcasm detection remains a challenge in natural language understanding, as
sarcastic intent often relies on subtle cross-modal cues spanning text, speech,
and vision. While prior work has primarily focused on textual or visual-textual
sarcasm, comprehensive audio-visual-textual sarcasm understanding remains
underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate large language models
(LLMs) and multimodal LLMs for sarcasm detection on English (MUStARD++) and
Chinese (MCSD 1.0) in zero-shot, few-shot, and LoRA fine-tuning settings. In
addition to direct classification, we explore models as feature encoders,
integrating their representations through a collaborative gating fusion module.
Experimental results show that audio-based models achieve the strongest
unimodal performance, while text-audio and audio-vision combinations outperform
unimodal and trimodal models. Furthermore, MLLMs such as Qwen-Omni show
competitive zero-shot and fine-tuned performance. Our findings highlight the
potential of MLLMs for cross-lingual, audio-visual-textual sarcasm
understanding.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在现实应用中日益普及，但其在对抗条件下的安全性尚未充分探索。

Method: 由26名红队成员生成726个对抗性提示，涵盖非法活动、虚假信息和不道德行为三类危害，提交给四种主流模型，并由17名标注员对2904条输出按5分制评估有害性。

Result: Pixtral 12B有害响应率最高（约62%），Claude Sonnet 3.5最抗攻击（约10%）；纯文本提示比多模态更易绕过安全机制；模型类型与输入模态均显著影响有害性。

Conclusion: 随着多模态大语言模型广泛应用，必须建立更强大的多模态安全评估基准。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used in real world
applications, yet their safety under adversarial conditions remains
underexplored. This study evaluates the harmlessness of four leading MLLMs
(GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus) when exposed to
adversarial prompts across text-only and multimodal formats. A team of 26 red
teamers generated 726 prompts targeting three harm categories: illegal
activity, disinformation, and unethical behaviour. These prompts were submitted
to each model, and 17 annotators rated 2,904 model outputs for harmfulness
using a 5-point scale. Results show significant differences in vulnerability
across models and modalities. Pixtral 12B exhibited the highest rate of harmful
responses (~62%), while Claude Sonnet 3.5 was the most resistant (~10%).
Contrary to expectations, text-only prompts were slightly more effective at
bypassing safety mechanisms than multimodal ones. Statistical analysis
confirmed that both model type and input modality were significant predictors
of harmfulness. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust,
multimodal safety benchmarks as MLLMs are deployed more widely.

Motivation: 减少高惩罚误分类，提升分级准确性以辅助教育评估。

Method: 应用保形预测生成覆盖集，再以softmax重归一化概率加权平均解码。

Result: 在不同基础模型上QWK提升1-3分，句子级达84.9%/85.7%，文档级73.3%。

Conclusion: 方法兼顾统计保证与实用价值，可辅助人工聚焦少量合理分级。

Abstract: We present a simple, model-agnostic post-processing technique for
fine-grained Arabic readability classification in the BAREC 2025 Shared Task
(19 ordinal levels). Our method applies conformal prediction to generate
prediction sets with coverage guarantees, then computes weighted averages using
softmax-renormalized probabilities over the conformal sets. This
uncertainty-aware decoding improves Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) by reducing
high-penalty misclassifications to nearer levels. Our approach shows consistent
QWK improvements of 1-3 points across different base models. In the strict
track, our submission achieves QWK scores of 84.9\%(test) and 85.7\% (blind
test) for sentence level, and 73.3\% for document level. For Arabic educational
assessment, this enables human reviewers to focus on a handful of plausible
levels, combining statistical guarantees with practical usability.

Motivation: 解决异构查询带来的缓存选择组合复杂性，提升LLM推理成本效益。

Result: 理论证明算法遗憾界为$O(\sqrt{MNT})$，实验显示总成本降低约12%。

Conclusion: 该算法在异构查询场景下兼具理论优势与实际效果，填补了此前缺乏问题相关界的研究空白。

Abstract: This paper revisits the LLM cache bandit problem, with a special focus on
addressing the query heterogeneity for cost-effective LLM inference. Previous
works often assume uniform query sizes. Heterogeneous query sizes introduce a
combinatorial structure for cache selection, making the cache replacement
process more computationally and statistically challenging. We treat optimal
cache selection as a knapsack problem and employ an accumulation-based strategy
to effectively balance computational overhead and cache updates. In theoretical
analysis, we prove that the regret of our algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{MNT})$
bound, improving the coefficient of $\sqrt{MN}$ compared to the $O(MN\sqrt{T})$
result in Berkeley, where $N$ is the total number of queries and $M$ is the
cache size. Additionally, we also provide a problem-dependent bound, which was
absent in previous works. The experiment rely on real-world data show that our
algorithm reduces the total cost by approximately 12\%.

Method: 构建评估框架，从用法特征、创意性、信息量三方面，对比在线俚语词典（OSD）的人类用例与GPT-4o、Llama-3生成的俚语。

Result: LLM生成的俚语存在系统性偏差，虽具创意性，但与人类用法对齐不足，不适合作为模型蒸馏的金标准或用于外推性语言分析。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型尚未充分捕捉与人类一致的俚语结构知识，限制其在高阶语言任务中的应用。

Abstract: Slang is a commonly used type of informal language that poses a daunting
challenge to NLP systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs),
however, have made the problem more approachable. While LLM agents are becoming
more widely applied to intermediary tasks such as slang detection and slang
interpretation, their generalizability and reliability are heavily dependent on
whether these models have captured structural knowledge about slang that align
well with human attested slang usages. To answer this question, we contribute a
systematic comparison between human and machine-generated slang usages. Our
evaluative framework focuses on three core aspects: 1) Characteristics of the
usages that reflect systematic biases in how machines perceive slang, 2)
Creativity reflected by both lexical coinages and word reuses employed by the
slang usages, and 3) Informativeness of the slang usages when used as
gold-standard examples for model distillation. By comparing human-attested
slang usages from the Online Slang Dictionary (OSD) and slang generated by
GPT-4o and Llama-3, we find significant biases in how LLMs perceive slang. Our
results suggest that while LLMs have captured significant knowledge about the
creative aspects of slang, such knowledge does not align with humans
sufficiently to enable LLMs for extrapolative tasks such as linguistic
analyses.

Conclusion: M-DaQ有效提升LLM多语言能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multilingual Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is essential for enabling large
language models (LLMs) to generalize effectively across diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts. However, the scarcity of high-quality multilingual training
data and corresponding building method remains a critical bottleneck. While
data selection has shown promise in English settings, existing methods often
fail to generalize across languages due to reliance on simplistic heuristics or
language-specific assumptions. In this work, we introduce Multilingual Data
Quality and Diversity (M-DaQ), a novel method for improving LLMs
multilinguality, by selecting high-quality and semantically diverse
multilingual IFT samples. We further conduct the first systematic investigation
of the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis (SAH) in multilingual setting.
Empirical results across 18 languages demonstrate that models fine-tuned with
M-DaQ method achieve significant performance gains over vanilla baselines over
60% win rate. Human evaluations further validate these gains, highlighting the
increment of cultural points in the response. We release the M-DaQ code to
support future research.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上AUROC提升5.55%，F1提升2.08%，具备强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效捕捉人机文本本质差异，为可靠检测提供新范式。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has blurred the line
between AI-generated and human-written text. This progress brings societal
risks such as misinformation, authorship ambiguity, and intellectual property
concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated text detection
methods. However, recent advances in generative language modeling have resulted
in significant overlap between the feature distributions of human-written and
AI-generated text, blurring classification boundaries and making accurate
detection increasingly challenging. To address the above challenges, we propose
a DNA-inspired perspective, leveraging a repair-based process to directly and
interpretably capture the intrinsic differences between human-written and
AI-generated text. Building on this perspective, we introduce DNA-DetectLLM, a
zero-shot detection method for distinguishing AI-generated and human-written
text. The method constructs an ideal AI-generated sequence for each input,
iteratively repairs non-optimal tokens, and quantifies the cumulative repair
effort as an interpretable detection signal. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and exhibits
strong robustness against various adversarial attacks and input lengths.
Specifically, DNA-DetectLLM achieves relative improvements of 5.55% in AUROC
and 2.08% in F1 score across multiple public benchmark datasets.

Result: 实验表明Climb能准确衡量跨语言交互，训练出的模型性能达SOTA水平。

Conclusion: Climb为多语言训练数据分配提供了系统化、高效的新方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to a wide range of
applications worldwide, driving an unprecedented global demand for effective
multilingual capabilities. Central to achieving robust multilingual performance
is the strategic allocation of language proportions within training corpora.
However, determining optimal language ratios is highly challenging due to
intricate cross-lingual interactions and sensitivity to dataset scale. This
paper introduces Climb (Cross-Lingual Interaction-aware Multilingual
Balancing), a novel framework designed to systematically optimize multilingual
data allocation. At its core, Climb introduces a cross-lingual
interaction-aware language ratio, explicitly quantifying each language's
effective allocation by capturing inter-language dependencies. Leveraging this
ratio, Climb proposes a principled two-step optimization procedure--first
equalizing marginal benefits across languages, then maximizing the magnitude of
the resulting language allocation vectors--significantly simplifying the
inherently complex multilingual optimization problem. Extensive experiments
confirm that Climb can accurately measure cross-lingual interactions across
various multilingual settings. LLMs trained with Climb-derived proportions
consistently achieve state-of-the-art multilingual performance, even achieving
competitive performance with open-sourced LLMs trained with more tokens.

Result: 语言使学习系统能高效获取抽象概念与因果结构，从而发展出类人智能。

Conclusion: 语言是通向通用人工智能与人类智能核心能力的关键桥梁。

Abstract: We use language to communicate our thoughts. But is language merely the
expression of thoughts, which are themselves produced by other, nonlinguistic
parts of our minds? Or does language play a more transformative role in human
cognition, allowing us to have thoughts that we otherwise could (or would) not
have? Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science
have reinvigorated this old question. We argue that language may hold the key
to the emergence of both more general AI systems and central aspects of human
intelligence. We highlight two related properties of language that make it such
a powerful tool for developing domain--general abilities. First, language
offers compact representations that make it easier to represent and reason
about many abstract concepts (e.g., exact numerosity). Second, these compressed
representations are the iterated output of collective minds. In learning a
language, we learn a treasure trove of culturally evolved abstractions. Taken
together, these properties mean that a sufficiently powerful learning system
exposed to language--whether biological or artificial--learns a compressed
model of the world, reverse engineering many of the conceptual and causal
structures that support human (and human-like) thought.

mechanism with multiple LLMs to generate diverse, high-quality topics within
this structure. For each topic, we use lightweight BM25 retrieval to obtain
relevant documents and concatenate them into 128K-token training samples.
Experiments on HELMET and Ruler benchmarks demonstrate that LiteLong achieves
competitive long-context performance and can seamlessly integrate with other
long-dependency enhancement methods. LiteLong makes high-quality long-context
data synthesis more accessible by reducing both computational and data
engineering costs, facilitating further research in long-context language
training.

TL;DR: R2U通过过程监督优化检索文档的生成效用，提升问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效捕捉文档对生成任务的实际效用。

Method: 提出R2U框架，利用大模型监督蒸馏训练小型重写器。

Result: 在多个开放域问答基准上优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: R2U能有效弥合检索相关性与生成效用之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems often suffer from a gap between
optimizing retrieval relevance and generative utility: retrieved documents may
be topically relevant but still lack the content needed for effective reasoning
during generation. While existing "bridge" modules attempt to rewrite the
retrieved text for better generation, we show how they fail to capture true
document utility. In this work, we propose R2U, with a key distinction of
directly optimizing to maximize the probability of generating a correct answer
through process supervision. As such direct observation is expensive, we also
propose approximating an efficient distillation pipeline by scaling the
supervision from LLMs, which helps the smaller rewriter model generalize
better. We evaluate our method across multiple open-domain question-answering
benchmarks. The empirical results demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong bridging baselines.

TL;DR: 提出基于分块的自监督学习方法（Chunk SSL），适用于流式与离线语音预训练，提升语音识别与翻译效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习多假设完整语句，难以适应流式场景中的部分语句输入。

Method: 采用分块掩码预测损失，结合前序块信息恢复掩码帧；使用高分辨率有限标量量化（FSQ）离散特征，并引入分组掩码损失降低计算开销。

Result: 在Librispeech和Must-C数据集上，流式与离线模式均取得具竞争力的语音识别与翻译结果。

Conclusion: Chunk SSL为语音预训练提供统一解决方案，兼顾效率与性能，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Low latency speech human-machine communication is becoming increasingly
necessary as speech technology advances quickly in the last decade. One of the
primary factors behind the advancement of speech technology is self-supervised
learning. Most self-supervised learning algorithms are designed with full
utterance assumption and compromises have to made if partial utterances are
presented, which are common in the streaming applications. In this work, we
propose a chunk based self-supervised learning (Chunk SSL) algorithm as an
unified solution for both streaming and offline speech pre-training. Chunk SSL
is optimized with the masked prediction loss and an acoustic encoder is
encouraged to restore indices of those masked speech frames with help from
unmasked frames in the same chunk and preceding chunks. A copy and append data
augmentation approach is proposed to conduct efficient chunk based
pre-training. Chunk SSL utilizes a finite scalar quantization (FSQ) module to
discretize input speech features and our study shows a high resolution FSQ
codebook, i.e., a codebook with vocabulary size up to a few millions, is
beneficial to transfer knowledge from the pre-training task to the downstream
tasks. A group masked prediction loss is employed during pre-training to
alleviate the high memory and computation cost introduced by the large
codebook. The proposed approach is examined in two speech to text tasks, i.e.,
speech recognition and speech translation. Experimental results on the
\textsc{Librispeech} and \textsc{Must-C} datasets show that the proposed method
could achieve very competitive results for speech to text tasks at both
streaming and offline modes.

Result: 实验证明DivLogicEval需强逻辑推理能力，并比较了主流LLM在该任务上的表现差异。

Conclusion: DivLogicEval能更忠实评估LLM逻辑推理能力，有助于推动模型在该方向的改进。

Abstract: Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important
measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular
benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful
evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning
benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are
deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may
lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical
logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of
diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable
evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the
influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we
demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the
questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs
in conducting logical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学信息抽取方法局限于窄领域，难以处理跨学科研究，且常导致信息碎片化或冲突。

Method: 构建包含500篇摘要的多领域数据集，采用统一事件抽取框架，分段标注背景、方法、结果、结论及触发词与论元。

Result: 实验显示当前模型在社会学与人文学科表现较差，与人工标注存在显著差距。

Conclusion: SciEvent为跨领域科学信息抽取提供了具挑战性的基准，推动通用化发展。

Abstract: Scientific information extraction (SciIE) has primarily relied on
entity-relation extraction in narrow domains, limiting its applicability to
interdisciplinary research and struggling to capture the necessary context of
scientific information, often resulting in fragmented or conflicting
statements. In this paper, we introduce SciEvent, a novel multi-domain
benchmark of scientific abstracts annotated via a unified event extraction (EE)
schema designed to enable structured and context-aware understanding of
scientific content. It includes 500 abstracts across five research domains,
with manual annotations of event segments, triggers, and fine-grained
arguments. We define SciIE as a multi-stage EE pipeline: (1) segmenting
abstracts into core scientific activities--Background, Method, Result, and
Conclusion; and (2) extracting the corresponding triggers and arguments.
Experiments with fine-tuned EE models, large language models (LLMs), and human
annotators reveal a performance gap, with current models struggling in domains
such as sociology and humanities. SciEvent serves as a challenging benchmark
and a step toward generalizable, multi-domain SciIE.

Result: 在真实与合成数据集上验证了方法能有效实现概念级遗忘并保留无关知识。

Conclusion: 该方法为大语言模型提供更直观、高效的遗忘机制，满足隐私与版权需求。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) has recently attracted considerable attention as a
solution to privacy and copyright issues in large language models (LLMs).
Existing MU methods aim to remove specific target sentences from an LLM while
minimizing damage to unrelated knowledge. However, these approaches require
explicit target sentences and do not support removing broader concepts, such as
persons or events. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept Unlearning
(CU) as a new requirement for LLM unlearning. We leverage knowledge graphs to
represent the LLM's internal knowledge and define CU as removing the forgetting
target nodes and associated edges. This graph-based formulation enables a more
intuitive unlearning and facilitates the design of more effective methods. We
propose a novel method that prompts the LLM to generate knowledge triplets and
explanatory sentences about the forgetting target and applies the unlearning
process to these representations. Our approach enables more precise and
comprehensive concept removal by aligning the unlearning process with the LLM's
internal knowledge representations. Experiments on real-world and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method effectively achieves concept-level
unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更真实、稳定的LLM遗忘效果。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across various
applications, privacy and copyright concerns have heightened the need for more
effective LLM unlearning techniques. Many existing unlearning methods aim to
suppress undesirable outputs through additional training (e.g., gradient
ascent), which reduces the probability of generating such outputs. While such
suppression-based approaches can control model outputs, they may not eliminate
the underlying knowledge embedded in the model's internal activations; muting a
response is not the same as forgetting it. Moreover, such suppression-based
methods often suffer from model collapse. To address these issues, we propose a
novel unlearning method that directly intervenes in the model's internal
activations. In our formulation, forgetting is defined as a state in which the
activation of a forgotten target is indistinguishable from that of ``unknown''
entities. Our method introduces an unlearning objective that modifies the
activation of the target entity away from those of known entities and toward
those of unknown entities in a sparse autoencoder latent space. By aligning the
target's internal activation with those of unknown entities, we shift the
model's recognition of the target entity from ``known'' to ``unknown'',
achieving genuine forgetting while avoiding over-suppression and model
collapse. Empirically, we show that our method effectively aligns the internal
activations of the forgotten target, a result that the suppression-based
approaches do not reliably achieve. Additionally, our method effectively
reduces the model's recall of target knowledge in question-answering tasks
without significant damage to the non-target knowledge.

Abstract: Medical English-Vietnamese machine translation (En-Vi MT) is essential for
healthcare access and communication in Vietnam, yet Vietnamese remains a
low-resource and under-studied language. We systematically evaluate prompting
strategies for six multilingual LLMs (0.5B-9B parameters) on the MedEV dataset,
comparing zero-shot, few-shot, and dictionary-augmented prompting with Meddict,
an English-Vietnamese medical lexicon. Results show that model scale is the
primary driver of performance: larger LLMs achieve strong zero-shot results,
while few-shot prompting yields only marginal improvements. In contrast,
terminology-aware cues and embedding-based example retrieval consistently
improve domain-specific translation. These findings underscore both the promise
and the current limitations of multilingual LLMs for medical En-Vi MT.

Conclusion: 语音语言模型在语法层面表现更优，概念层面仍需加强。

Abstract: Transformer-based speech language models (SLMs) have significantly improved
neural speech recognition and understanding. While existing research has
examined how well SLMs encode shallow acoustic and phonetic features, the
extent to which SLMs encode nuanced syntactic and conceptual features remains
unclear. By drawing parallels with linguistic competence assessments for large
language models, this study is the first to systematically evaluate the
presence of contextual syntactic and semantic features across SLMs for
self-supervised learning (S3M), automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech
compression (codec), and as the encoder for auditory large language models
(AudioLLMs). Through minimal pair designs and diagnostic feature analysis
across 71 tasks spanning diverse linguistic levels, our layer-wise and
time-resolved analysis uncovers that 1) all speech encode grammatical features
more robustly than conceptual ones.

Result: 在希腊语ASR基准上平均相对提升约20%，实现SOTA性能，验证跨模态表征对齐有效性。

Conclusion: 连续空间融合是构建多语言、低资源语音LLM的有效路径，具备良好泛化潜力。

Abstract: We present a multimodal fusion framework that bridges pre-trained
decoder-based large language models (LLM) and acoustic encoder-decoder
architectures such as Whisper, with the aim of building speech-enabled LLMs.
Instead of directly using audio embeddings, we explore an intermediate
audio-conditioned text space as a more effective mechanism for alignment. Our
method operates fully in continuous text representation spaces, fusing
Whisper's hidden decoder states with those of an LLM through cross-modal
attention, and supports both offline and streaming modes. We introduce
\textit{VoxKrikri}, the first Greek speech LLM, and show through analysis that
our approach effectively aligns representations across modalities. These
results highlight continuous space fusion as a promising path for multilingual
and low-resource speech LLMs, while achieving state-of-the-art results for
Automatic Speech Recognition in Greek, providing an average $\sim20\%$ relative
improvement across benchmarks.

Motivation: 自动发音评估对计算机辅助语言学习至关重要，而大尺度多模态模型在此领域的细粒度评估效果尚不明确。

Method: 使用Speechocean762数据集和私有语料对大尺度多模态模型进行微调，并与零样本设置及现有系统对比。

Result: 微调模型在词句级别表现优异，音素级别评估仍困难；皮尔逊相关系数达0.9，斯皮尔曼相关系数约0.6，表明后者更能反映排序一致性。

Conclusion: 大尺度多模态模型在自动发音评估中展现出潜力，但仍需改进细粒度建模和排序感知评估方法。

Abstract: Automatic Pronunciation Assessment (APA) is critical for Computer-Assisted
Language Learning (CALL), requiring evaluation across multiple granularities
and aspects. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) present new opportunities for APA,
but their effectiveness in fine-grained assessment remains uncertain. This work
investigates fine-tuning LMMs for APA using the Speechocean762 dataset and a
private corpus. Fine-tuning significantly outperforms zero-shot settings and
achieves competitive results on single-granularity tasks compared to public and
commercial systems. The model performs well at word and sentence levels, while
phoneme-level assessment remains challenging. We also observe that the Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) reaches 0.9, whereas Spearman's rank Correlation
Coefficient (SCC) remains around 0.6, suggesting that SCC better reflects
ordinal consistency. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations
of LMMs for APA and point to future work on fine-grained modeling and
rank-aware evaluation.

Method: 训练学生模型生成故事，由教师模型对其可读性、连贯性和创造力评分，形成交互学习循环。

Result: 仅用100万词交互学习，叙事能力提升效果等同于4.1亿词的下一词预测训练。

Conclusion: 高层反馈显著提升数据效率，为低资源语言模型训练提供新路径。

Abstract: Children efficiently acquire language not just by listening, but by
interacting with others in their social environment. Conversely, large language
models are typically trained with next-word prediction on massive amounts of
text. Motivated by this contrast, we investigate whether language models can be
trained with less data by learning not only from next-word prediction but also
from high-level, cognitively inspired feedback. We train a student model to
generate stories, which a teacher model rates on readability, narrative
coherence, and creativity. By varying the amount of pretraining before the
feedback loop, we assess the impact of this interactive learning on formal and
functional linguistic competence. We find that the high-level feedback is
highly data efficient: With just 1 M words of input in interactive learning,
storytelling skills can improve as much as with 410 M words of next-word
prediction.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖超参数调优或真实分布信息，但实际中难以获取或使用，因此需更实用的公平性提升方案。

Method: 借鉴认知科学，采用频率框架提示（REFER），通过显式参考类别降低认知负荷，替代抽象概率表示。

Result: 实验表明REFER能有效提升意见摘要的公平性，且在大模型和强推理指令下效果更佳。

Conclusion: 频率框架提示是一种实用且有效的方法，可改善大语言模型在意见摘要中的公平表现。

Abstract: Individuals express diverse opinions, a fair summary should represent these
viewpoints comprehensively. Previous research on fairness in opinion
summarisation using large language models (LLMs) relied on hyperparameter
tuning or providing ground truth distributional information in prompts.
However, these methods face practical limitations: end-users rarely modify
default model parameters, and accurate distributional information is often
unavailable. Building upon cognitive science research demonstrating that
frequency-based representations reduce systematic biases in human statistical
reasoning by making reference classes explicit and reducing cognitive load,
this study investigates whether frequency framed prompting (REFER) can
similarly enhance fairness in LLM opinion summarisation. Through systematic
experimentation with different prompting frameworks, we adapted techniques
known to improve human reasoning to elicit more effective information
processing in language models compared to abstract probabilistic
representations.Our results demonstrate that REFER enhances fairness in
language models when summarising opinions. This effect is particularly
pronounced in larger language models and using stronger reasoning instructions.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型是否能模拟计算论证理论中的结构化推理，尤其针对自然辩论中的论证图结构。

Method: 使用QuAD语义框架，在无图结构提示下，通过对话数据测试多种LLM及提示策略（如思维链、上下文学习）的论证排序能力。

Result: 模型与QuAD排序中等一致，长输入或语序混乱时性能下降，高级提示可减轻长度与位置偏差。

Conclusion: LLM在形式化论证语义建模上具潜力但存局限，需发展图感知推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at linear reasoning tasks but remain
underexplored on non-linear structures such as those found in natural debates,
which are best expressed as argument graphs. We evaluate whether LLMs can
approximate structured reasoning from Computational Argumentation Theory (CAT).
Specifically, we use Quantitative Argumentation Debate (QuAD) semantics, which
assigns acceptability scores to arguments based on their attack and support
relations. Given only dialogue-formatted debates from two NoDE datasets, models
are prompted to rank arguments without access to the underlying graph. We test
several LLMs under advanced instruction strategies, including Chain-of-Thought
and In-Context Learning. While models show moderate alignment with QuAD
rankings, performance degrades with longer inputs or disrupted discourse flow.
Advanced prompting helps mitigate these effects by reducing biases related to
argument length and position. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LLMs in modeling formal argumentation semantics and motivate
future work on graph-aware reasoning.

Motivation: 解决长上下文输入中KV缓存带来的内存瓶颈问题，尤其避免序列级压缩导致的重要上下文丢失。

Method: 采用无分块训练策略与gist shift技巧的高效内核，支持灵活推理与实时内存压缩。

Result: 在多个长上下文任务中显著提升压缩质量，尤其擅长细节回忆与长程依赖建模。

Conclusion: UniGist在压缩效率与上下文保留之间取得良好平衡，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly capable of handling long-context
inputs, but the memory overhead of key-value (KV) cache remains a major
bottleneck for general-purpose deployment. While various compression strategies
have been explored, sequence-level compression, which drops the full KV caches
for certain tokens, is particularly challenging as it can lead to the loss of
important contextual information. To address this, we introduce UniGist, a
sequence-level long-context compression framework that efficiently preserves
context information by replacing raw tokens with special compression tokens
(gists) in a fine-grained manner. We adopt a chunk-free training strategy and
design an efficient kernel with a gist shift trick, enabling optimized GPU
training. Our scheme also supports flexible inference by allowing the actual
removal of compressed tokens, resulting in real-time memory savings.
Experiments across multiple long-context tasks demonstrate that UniGist
significantly improves compression quality, with especially strong performance
in detail-recalling tasks and long-range dependency modeling.

Result: 构建了含7.13亿英文词的平行语料库，规模超以往工作两倍，且为目前最大规模纯人工翻译公开语料。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、灵活、可复现，语料与代码以MIT许可证开源，推动机器翻译发展。

Abstract: The quality and accessibility of multilingual datasets are crucial for
advancing machine translation. However, previous corpora built from United
Nations documents have suffered from issues such as opaque process, difficulty
of reproduction, and limited scale. To address these challenges, we introduce a
complete end-to-end solution, from data acquisition via web scraping to text
alignment. The entire process is fully reproducible, with a minimalist
single-machine example and optional distributed computing steps for
scalability. At its core, we propose a new Graph-Aided Paragraph Alignment
(GAPA) algorithm for efficient and flexible paragraph-level alignment. The
resulting corpus contains over 713 million English tokens, more than doubling
the scale of prior work. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the
largest publicly available parallel corpus composed entirely of
human-translated, non-AI-generated content. Our code and corpus are accessible

Abstract: While the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to
advance, it remains unclear how such ability varies across languages in
multilingual LLMs and whether different languages produce reasoning paths that
complement each other. To investigate this question, we train a reward model to
rank generated responses for a given question across languages. Our results
show that our cross-lingual reward model substantially improves mathematical
reasoning performance compared to using reward modeling within a single
language, benefiting even high-resource languages. While English often exhibits
the highest performance in multilingual models, we find that cross-lingual
sampling particularly benefits English under low sampling budgets. Our findings
reveal new opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning by leveraging the

TL;DR: 研究视觉信息如何影响语音和文本模型的语言表征，发现视觉接地提升跨模态对齐，但主要增强词身份而非语义区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉信息对语音与文本模型内部词表征的影响，以改进语音模型的语义能力。

Method: 通过全局表征比较和针对性聚类分析，检验语音与文本模型在音位与语义层面的区分能力。

Result: 视觉接地增强语音与文本表征对齐，但语音模型仍以音位为主，语义区分未提升；文本模型语义区分略有改善。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于开发更高效方法，为语音模型注入视觉引导的语义信息。

Abstract: How does visual information included in training affect language processing
in audio- and text-based deep learning models? We explore how such visual
grounding affects model-internal representations of words, and find
substantially different effects in speech- vs. text-based language encoders.
Firstly, global representational comparisons reveal that visual grounding
increases alignment between representations of spoken and written language, but
this effect seems mainly driven by enhanced encoding of word identity rather
than meaning. We then apply targeted clustering analyses to probe for phonetic
vs. semantic discriminability in model representations. Speech-based
representations remain phonetically dominated with visual grounding, but in
contrast to text-based representations, visual grounding does not improve
semantic discriminability. Our findings could usefully inform the development
of more efficient methods to enrich speech-based models with visually-informed
semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏细粒度科目覆盖、忽略逐步推理、偏重英文，未系统评估视觉信息作用。

Method: 构建含图像的多选题基准，采用双评估框架分析答案准确率与思维链完整性，并对比不同输入模式性能。

Result: 提供细粒度资源与稳健方法，剖析MLLM多模态推理能力，揭示难度与视觉信息影响。

Conclusion: Multi-Physics填补中文物理多模态评估空白，推动科学领域MLLM发展。

Abstract: While multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning progress,
their application in specialized scientific domains like physics reveals
significant gaps in current evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, existing
benchmarks often lack fine-grained subject coverage, neglect the step-by-step
reasoning process, and are predominantly English-centric, failing to
systematically evaluate the role of visual information. Therefore, we introduce
\textbf {Multi-Physics} for Chinese physics reasoning, a comprehensive
benchmark that includes 5 difficulty levels, featuring 1,412 image-associated,
multiple-choice questions spanning 11 high-school physics subjects. We employ a
dual evaluation framework to evaluate 20 different MLLMs, analyzing both final
answer accuracy and the step-by-step integrity of their chain-of-thought.
Furthermore, we systematically study the impact of difficulty level and visual
information by comparing the model performance before and after changing the
input mode. Our work provides not only a fine-grained resource for the
community but also offers a robust methodology for dissecting the multimodal
reasoning process of state-of-the-art MLLMs, and our dataset and code have been
open-sourced: https://github.com/luozhongze/Multi-Physics.

TL;DR: SVD通过解码时引导输出分布，实现轻量级任务适配，无需额外训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低大模型任务适配成本，避免依赖参数微调。

Method: 利用KL散度梯度提取引导向量，在解码阶段调整输出分布。

Result: 在多个任务和基准上提升准确率与真实性，最高达5点。

Conclusion: SVD提供了一种理论扎实、轻量高效的LLM任务适配新路径。

Abstract: Adapting billion-parameter language models to a downstream task is still
costly, even with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We re-cast task
adaptation as output-distribution alignment: the objective is to steer the
output distribution toward the task distribution directly during decoding
rather than indirectly through weight updates. Building on this view, we
introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVD), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and
theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and
extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained
models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to
steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We
theoretically prove that SVD is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of
full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the
steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVD paired with four
standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 points and
open-ended truthfulness by 2 points, with similar gains (1-2 points) on
commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT
adapter. SVD thus offers a lightweight, theoretically grounded path to stronger
task adaptation for large language models.

Method: 通过分析现有检测系统并结合认知偏差、社会动态和情绪反应等心理学概念，提出改进方向。

Result: 揭示了现有方法的关键局限，并提出整合神经行为模型等未来研究路径。

Conclusion: 融合人类心理与技术因素的框架有望更有效地检测和缓解虚假信息的社会危害。

Abstract: Misinformation remains one of the most significant issues in the digital age.
While automated fact-checking has emerged as a viable solution, most current
systems are limited to evaluating factual accuracy. However, the detrimental
effect of misinformation transcends simple falsehoods; it takes advantage of
how individuals perceive, interpret, and emotionally react to information. This
underscores the need to move beyond factuality and adopt more human-centered
detection frameworks. In this survey, we explore the evolving interplay between
traditional fact-checking approaches and psychological concepts such as
cognitive biases, social dynamics, and emotional responses. By analyzing
state-of-the-art misinformation detection systems through the lens of human
psychology and behavior, we reveal critical limitations of current methods and
identify opportunities for improvement. Additionally, we outline future
research directions aimed at creating more robust and adaptive frameworks, such
as neuro-behavioural models that integrate technological factors with the
complexities of human cognition and social influence. These approaches offer
promising pathways to more effectively detect and mitigate the societal harms
of misinformation.

Result: 在QMSum与FAME数据集上，FRAME降低2/5错误，SCOPE优于基线，P-MESA评估准确率达89%。

Conclusion: 应重新思考摘要任务以提升可控性、忠实性与个性化。

Abstract: Meeting summarization with large language models (LLMs) remains error-prone,
often producing outputs with hallucinations, omissions, and irrelevancies. We
present FRAME, a modular pipeline that reframes summarization as a semantic
enrichment task. FRAME extracts and scores salient facts, organizes them
thematically, and uses these to enrich an outline into an abstractive summary.
To personalize summaries, we introduce SCOPE, a reason-out-loud protocol that
has the model build a reasoning trace by answering nine questions before
content selection. For evaluation, we propose P-MESA, a multi-dimensional,
reference-free evaluation framework to assess if a summary fits a target
reader. P-MESA reliably identifies error instances, achieving >= 89% balanced
accuracy against human annotations and strongly aligns with human severity
ratings (r >= 0.70). On QMSum and FAME, FRAME reduces hallucination and
omission by 2 out of 5 points (measured with MESA), while SCOPE improves
knowledge fit and goal alignment over prompt-only baselines. Our findings
advocate for rethinking summarization to improve control, faithfulness, and
personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AES系统缺乏置信度与解释，限制其在高风险考试中的应用。

Method: 对Llama-3 8B和Qwen-2.5 3B进行微调，并在90%风险水平下校准，使用UAcc评估可靠性。

Result: 校准模型稳定达到覆盖率目标，预测集紧凑有效。

Conclusion: 开源中型LLM已可支持教师辅助AES，未来可扩展并开展用户研究。

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems now reach near human agreement on some
public benchmarks, yet real-world adoption, especially in high-stakes
examinations, remains limited. A principal obstacle is that most models output
a single score without any accompanying measure of confidence or explanation.
We address this gap with conformal prediction, a distribution-free wrapper that
equips any classifier with set-valued outputs and formal coverage guarantees.
Two open-source large language models (Llama-3 8B and Qwen-2.5 3B) are
fine-tuned on three diverse corpora (ASAP, TOEFL11, Cambridge-FCE) and
calibrated at a 90 percent risk level. Reliability is assessed with UAcc, an
uncertainty-aware accuracy that rewards models for being both correct and
concise. To our knowledge, this is the first work to combine conformal
prediction and UAcc for essay scoring. The calibrated models consistently meet
the coverage target while keeping prediction sets compact, indicating that
open-source, mid-sized LLMs can already support teacher-in-the-loop AES; we
discuss scaling and broader user studies as future work.

Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制在离散时间建模中的局限，探索更灵活的邻域交互方式。

Method: 引入局部最大动态模型，结合对齐敏感性参数，使用拟静止集分析系统行为，并借鉴李雅普诺夫方法研究稳定性。

Result: 证明系统状态凸包收敛但结构复杂化，不具有限时收敛性，并推导出不同参数下的极限行为。

Conclusion: 局部最大动态扩展了注意力机制理论框架，揭示了非对称交互下经典方法的局限，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: We introduce a new discrete-time attention model, termed the localmax
dynamics, which interpolates between the classic softmax dynamics and the
hardmax dynamics, where only the tokens that maximize the influence toward a
given token have a positive weight. As in hardmax, uniform weights are
determined by a parameter controlling neighbor influence, but the key extension
lies in relaxing neighborhood interactions through an alignment-sensitivity
parameter, which allows controlled deviations from pure hardmax behavior. As we
prove, while the convex hull of the token states still converges to a convex
polytope, its structure can no longer be fully described by a maximal alignment
set, prompting the introduction of quiescent sets to capture the invariant
behavior of tokens near vertices. We show that these sets play a key role in
understanding the asymptotic behavior of the system, even under time-varying
alignment sensitivity parameters. We further show that localmax dynamics does
not exhibit finite-time convergence and provide results for vanishing, nonzero,
time-varying alignment-sensitivity parameters, recovering the limiting behavior
of hardmax as a by-product. Finally, we adapt Lyapunov-based methods from
classical opinion dynamics, highlighting their limitations in the asymmetric
setting of localmax interactions and outlining directions for future research.

Motivation: 现有偏置项微调方法缺乏有效指导，难以选择最优偏置项以提升下游任务性能。

Method: 提出BEFT方法，系统选择需微调的偏置项，并在多种架构和规模的LLM上进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验证明BEFT在分类、多选和生成任务上优于其他偏置选择方法，具备高效性和通用性。

Conclusion: BEFT为偏置项微调提供了有效指导，显著提升参数效率与下游性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning all-bias-terms stands out among various parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, owing to its out-of-the-box usability and
competitive performance, especially in low-data regimes. Bias-only fine-tuning
has the potential for unprecedented parameter efficiency. However, the link
between fine-tuning different bias terms (i.e., bias terms in the query, key,
or value projections) and downstream performance remains unclear. The existing
approaches, e.g., based on the magnitude of bias change or empirical Fisher
information, provide limited guidance for selecting the particular bias term
for effective fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose an approach for selecting
the bias term to be fine-tuned, forming the foundation of our bias-efficient
fine-tuning (BEFT). We extensively evaluate our bias-efficient approach against
other bias-selection approaches, across a wide range of large language models
(LLMs) spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures from 110M to 6.7B
parameters. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
bias-efficient approach on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
multiple-choice, and generation tasks.

Motivation: 现有口语评估方法存在误差传播或忽略语篇级信息的问题，难以满足日益增长的L2学习者需求。

Result: 在Speak & Improve基准测试中表现优于先前最优级联系统，具备跨部分泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该模型紧凑高效，专为计算机辅助语言学习应用设计，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Spoken Language Assessment (SLA) estimates a learner's oral proficiency from
spontaneous speech. The growing population of L2 English speakers has
intensified the demand for reliable SLA, a critical component of Computer
Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Existing efforts often rely on cascaded
pipelines, which are prone to error propagation, or end-to-end models that
often operate on a short audio window, which might miss discourse-level
evidence. This paper introduces a novel multimodal foundation model approach
that performs session-level evaluation in a single pass. Our approach couples
multi-target learning with a frozen, Whisper ASR model-based speech prior for
acoustic-aware calibration, allowing for jointly learning holistic and
trait-level objectives of SLA without resorting to handcrafted features. By
coherently processing the entire response session of an L2 speaker, the model
excels at predicting holistic oral proficiency. Experiments conducted on the
Speak & Improve benchmark demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms
the previous state-of-the-art cascaded system and exhibits robust cross-part
generalization, producing a compact deployable grader that is tailored for CALL
applications.

Motivation: 现有LLM直接用于口语对话效果不佳，且语音适配可能损害推理能力。

Method: 通过解耦推理与语音输出，引入中间‘verbalizing’步骤，并开发低延迟的ReVerT工具。

Result: 多基准测试表明，方法显著提升语音自然性与简洁性，同时对推理影响极小。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡LLM推理能力与口语表达需求，为口语对话系统提供新思路。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) to
leverage their advanced reasoning capabilities. However, direct application of
LLMs in spoken communication often yield suboptimal results due to mismatches
between optimal textual and verbal delivery. While existing approaches adapt
LLMs to produce speech-friendly outputs, their impact on reasoning performance
remains underexplored. In this work, we propose Think-Verbalize-Speak, a
framework that decouples reasoning from spoken delivery to preserve the full
reasoning capacity of LLMs. Central to our method is verbalizing, an
intermediate step that translates thoughts into natural, speech-ready text. We
also introduce ReVerT, a latency-efficient verbalizer based on incremental and
asynchronous summarization. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that
our method enhances speech naturalness and conciseness with minimal impact on
reasoning. The project page with the dataset and the source code is available

TL;DR: DeCE是一种分解式LLM评估框架，通过自动提取标准答案要求中的实例化标准，分别评估精确率与召回率，显著提升与专家判断的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标难以准确衡量高风险领域长答案的语义正确性，且LLM评估常将多维质量压缩为单一分数。

Method: 提出DeCE框架，分解评估精确率（事实准确性与相关性）和召回率（必要概念覆盖），无需预定义分类或人工评分标准。

Result: 在法律问答任务中，DeCE与专家评分相关性达0.78，远超传统指标与现有LLM评估方法，并揭示模型在精确率与召回率间的权衡。

Conclusion: DeCE提供了一种可解释、可扩展且适用于专家领域的LLM评估方案。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form answers in high-stakes domains such as law or medicine
remains a fundamental challenge. Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to
capture semantic correctness, and current LLM-based evaluators often reduce
nuanced aspects of answer quality into a single undifferentiated score. We
introduce DeCE, a decomposed LLM evaluation framework that separates precision
(factual accuracy and relevance) and recall (coverage of required concepts),
using instance-specific criteria automatically extracted from gold answer
requirements. DeCE is model-agnostic and domain-general, requiring no
predefined taxonomies or handcrafted rubrics. We instantiate DeCE to evaluate
different LLMs on a real-world legal QA task involving multi-jurisdictional
reasoning and citation grounding. DeCE achieves substantially stronger
correlation with expert judgments ($r=0.78$), compared to traditional metrics
($r=0.12$), pointwise LLM scoring ($r=0.35$), and modern multidimensional
evaluators ($r=0.48$). It also reveals interpretable trade-offs: generalist
models favor recall, while specialized models favor precision. Importantly,
only 11.95% of LLM-generated criteria required expert revision, underscoring
DeCE's scalability. DeCE offers an interpretable and actionable LLM evaluation
framework in expert domains.

Motivation: 现有MoE剪枝方法采用均匀稀疏策略，忽略不同层专家冗余差异，导致性能下降。

Method: 通过可微分专家剪枝DiEP，将离散搜索空间转为连续空间，自适应学习层间重要性并调整剪枝率。

Result: 在五种先进MoE模型上验证，DiEP仅保留一半专家即可维持原模型92%性能，在MMLU数据集上优于其他方法达7.1%。

Conclusion: DiEP能更高效、灵活地压缩MoE模型，兼顾性能与资源消耗，为大规模MoE部署提供新方案。

Abstract: Despite the significant breakthrough of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), the
increasing scale of these MoE models presents huge memory and storage
challenges. Existing MoE pruning methods, which involve reducing parameter size
with a uniform sparsity across all layers, often lead to suboptimal outcomes
and performance degradation due to varying expert redundancy in different MoE
layers. To address this, we propose a non-uniform pruning strategy, dubbed
\textbf{Di}fferentiable \textbf{E}xpert \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{DiEP}), which
adaptively adjusts pruning rates at the layer level while jointly learning
inter-layer importance, effectively capturing the varying redundancy across
different MoE layers. By transforming the global discrete search space into a
continuous one, our method handles exponentially growing non-uniform expert
combinations, enabling adaptive gradient-based pruning. Extensive experiments
on five advanced MoE models demonstrate the efficacy of our method across
various NLP tasks. Notably, \textbf{DiEP} retains around 92\% of original
performance on Mixtral 8$\times$7B with only half the experts, outperforming
other pruning methods by up to 7.1\% on the challenging MMLU dataset.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型能否利用常识解决对话中的指代歧义，并分析简化语言请求对其能力的影响。

Method: 构建多语言评估数据集，采用LLM-as-Judge与人工标注评估多个主流模型，并对Llama-3.1-8B进行偏好优化微调。

Result: 现有模型倾向于固守单一解释或覆盖所有可能，而非模糊处理或请求澄清；简化提示削弱常识推理；微调显著提升表现。

Conclusion: 需进阶微调方法以增强模型处理歧义能力，确保其在多样沟通风格下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Ambiguous words or underspecified references require interlocutors to resolve
them, often by relying on shared context and commonsense knowledge. Therefore,
we systematically investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can leverage
commonsense to resolve referential ambiguity in multi-turn conversations and
analyze their behavior when ambiguity persists. Further, we study how requests
for simplified language affect this capacity. Using a novel multilingual
evaluation dataset, we test DeepSeek v3, GPT-4o, Qwen3-32B, GPT-4o-mini, and
Llama-3.1-8B via LLM-as-Judge and human annotations. Our findings indicate that
current LLMs struggle to resolve ambiguity effectively: they tend to commit to
a single interpretation or cover all possible references, rather than hedging
or seeking clarification. This limitation becomes more pronounced under
simplification prompts, which drastically reduce the use of commonsense
reasoning and diverse response strategies. Fine-tuning Llama-3.1-8B with Direct
Preference Optimization substantially improves ambiguity resolution across all
request types. These results underscore the need for advanced fine-tuning to
improve LLMs' handling of ambiguity and to ensure robust performance across
diverse communication styles.

Conclusion: CultureScope是当前最全面的LLM文化理解评估框架，开源促进后续研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse cultural
environments, evaluating their cultural understanding capability has become
essential for ensuring trustworthy and culturally aligned applications.
However, most existing benchmarks lack comprehensiveness and are challenging to
scale and adapt across different cultural contexts, because their frameworks
often lack guidance from well-established cultural theories and tend to rely on
expert-driven manual annotations. To address these issues, we propose
CultureScope, the most comprehensive evaluation framework to date for assessing
cultural understanding in LLMs. Inspired by the cultural iceberg theory, we
design a novel dimensional schema for cultural knowledge classification,
comprising 3 layers and 140 dimensions, which guides the automated construction
of culture-specific knowledge bases and corresponding evaluation datasets for
any given languages and cultures. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method can effectively evaluate cultural understanding. They also reveal that
existing large language models lack comprehensive cultural competence, and
merely incorporating multilingual data does not necessarily enhance cultural
understanding. All code and data files are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言难以精确表达复杂软件结构，导致大模型生成完整仓库效果不佳。

Method: 构建统一规划图RPG，分三阶段：提案规划、实现细化、图引导代码生成与测试验证。

Result: 在RepoCraft基准上，生成平均3.6万行代码，功能覆盖率81.5%，通过率69.7%，显著超越基线。

Conclusion: RPG有效建模依赖关系，支持渐进式规划，提升LLM对仓库结构的理解与生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel at function- and file-level code generation, yet
generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge.
This process demands coherent and reliable planning across proposal- and
implementation-level stages, while natural language, due to its ambiguity and
verbosity, is ill-suited for faithfully representing complex software
structures. To address this, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG),
a persistent representation that unifies proposal- and implementation-level
planning by encoding capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions
in one graph. RPG replaces ambiguous natural language with an explicit
blueprint, enabling long-horizon planning and scalable repository generation.
Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework for repository
generation from scratch. It operates in three stages: proposal-level planning
and implementation-level refinement to construct the graph, followed by
graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate this setting, we
construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks.
On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces repositories averaging nearly 36K LOC, roughly
3.9$\times$ the strongest baseline (Claude Code) and about 64$\times$ other
baselines. It attains 81.5% functional coverage and a 69.7% pass rate,
exceeding Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 percentage points, respectively. Further
analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables progressively more
sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and enhances LLM
understanding of repositories, thereby accelerating agent localization.

their beliefs, desires, and intentions. Plans are a central component of BDI
agents, and define sequences of actions that an agent must undertake to achieve
a certain goal. Existing approaches to plan generation often require
significant manual effort, and are mainly focused on single-agent systems. As a
result, in this work, we have developed a tool that automatically generates BDI
plans using Alternating-Time Temporal Logic (ATL). By using ATL, the plans
generated accommodate for possible competition or cooperation between the
agents in the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool by
generating plans for an illustrative game that requires agent collaboration to
achieve a shared goal. We show that the generated plans allow the agents to
successfully attain this goal.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了WinC-MAPF框架，提出DAG-ECBS算法，使用有界次优求解器仍能保证完备性，提升可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WinC-MAPF框架原有方法依赖最优求解器，限制了实用性与效率。

Method: 设计DAG-ECBS算法，动态分组并规划路径，保证每组解有界次优，同时维持完备性。

Result: DAG-ECBS相比SS-CBS更具可扩展性，优于无完备性保证的窗口ECBS。

Conclusion: 本研究为设计兼容WinC-MAPF框架的更多MAPF方法提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a set of
collision-free paths for a team of agents. Although several MAPF methods which
solve full-horizon MAPF have completeness guarantees, very few MAPF methods
that plan partial paths have completeness guarantees. Recent work introduced
the Windowed Complete MAPF (WinC-MAPF) framework, which shows how windowed
optimal MAPF solvers (e.g., SS-CBS) can use heuristic updates and disjoint
agent groups to maintain completeness even when planning partial paths
(Veerapaneni et al. 2024). A core limitation of WinC-MAPF is that they required
optimal MAPF solvers. Our main contribution is to extend WinC-MAPF by showing
how we can use a bounded suboptimal solver while maintaining completeness. In
particular, we design Dynamic Agent Grouping ECBS (DAG-ECBS) which dynamically
creates and plans agent groups while maintaining that each agent group solution
is bounded suboptimal. We prove how DAG-ECBS can maintain completeness in the
WinC-MAPF framework. DAG-ECBS shows improved scalability compared to SS-CBS and
can outperform windowed ECBS without completeness guarantees. More broadly, our
work serves as a blueprint for designing more MAPF methods that can use the
WinC-MAPF framework.

TL;DR: 提出基于提示词的框架，实现无需重训练的数据即时遗忘，兼顾性能与隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对GDPR等法规对数据遗忘的需求，解决传统方法计算昂贵且脆弱的问题。

Method: 将类别语义绑定至专用提示词，在单次训练中统一知识获取与移除。

Result: 实验表明可有效遗忘指定类别，保留其余性能，并抵御成员推断攻击。

Conclusion: 该架构内置可移除性，为构建模块化、可扩展且符合伦理的AI模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed multimedia analysis by enabling robust and
transferable representations across diverse modalities and tasks. However,
their static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands
-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by
privacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,
including retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often
computationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or
continuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:
rethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in
capability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies
knowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than
encoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics
to dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by
removing the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or
access to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves
predictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten
ones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security
guarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal
prevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.
This ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against
unauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for
deployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding
removability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new
foundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models.

Conclusion: MPNP-DDI为药物警戒、多药风险评估和精准医疗提供强大计算工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDI) is crucial for medication
safety and effective drug development. However, existing methods often struggle
to capture structural information across different scales, from local
functional groups to global molecular topology, and typically lack mechanisms
to quantify prediction confidence. To address these limitations, we propose
MPNP-DDI, a novel Multi-scale Graph Neural Process framework. The core of
MPNP-DDI is a unique message-passing scheme that, by being iteratively applied,
learns a hierarchy of graph representations at multiple scales. Crucially, a
cross-drug co-attention mechanism then dynamically fuses these multi-scale
representations to generate context-aware embeddings for interacting drug
pairs, while an integrated neural process module provides principled
uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPNP-DDI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets. By
providing accurate, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware predictions built upon
multi-scale structural features, MPNP-DDI represents a powerful computational
tool for pharmacovigilance, polypharmacy risk assessment, and precision
medicine.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has made significant advancements
in fields such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP),
demonstrating its capability to synthesize high-fidelity data and improve
generalization. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating GenAI
into wireless sensing systems. By leveraging generative techniques such as data
augmentation, domain adaptation, and denoising, wireless sensing applications,
including device localization, human activity recognition, and environmental
monitoring, can be significantly improved. This survey investigates the
convergence of GenAI and wireless sensing from two complementary perspectives.
First, we explore how GenAI can be integrated into wireless sensing pipelines,
focusing on two modes of integration: as a plugin to augment task-specific
models and as a solver to directly address sensing tasks. Second, we analyze
the characteristics of mainstream generative models, such as Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and diffusion
models, and discuss their applicability and unique advantages across various
wireless sensing tasks. We further identify key challenges in applying GenAI to
wireless sensing and outline a future direction toward a wireless foundation
model: a unified, pre-trained design capable of scalable, adaptable, and
efficient signal understanding across diverse sensing tasks.

Conclusion: IEFS-GMB有效提升EEG分类性能与临床适用性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based EEG classification is crucial for the automated detection
of neurological disorders, improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early
intervention. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals limits
model performance, making feature selection (FS) vital for optimizing
representations learned by neural network encoders. Existing FS methods are
seldom designed specifically for EEG diagnosis; many are architecture-dependent
and lack interpretability, limiting their applicability. Moreover, most rely on
single-iteration data, resulting in limited robustness to variability. To
address these issues, we propose IEFS-GMB, an Information Entropy-based Feature
Selection method guided by a Gradient Memory Bank. This approach constructs a
dynamic memory bank storing historical gradients, computes feature importance
via information entropy, and applies entropy-based weighting to select
informative EEG features. Experiments on four public neurological disease
datasets show that encoders enhanced with IEFS-GMB achieve accuracy
improvements of 0.64% to 6.45% over baseline models. The method also
outperforms four competing FS techniques and improves model interpretability,
supporting its practical use in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 推特数据结合机器学习可有效支持娱乐性药物的实时药效监测与表征。

Abstract: Understanding the real-world effects of recreational drug use remains a
critical challenge in public health and biomedical research, especially as
traditional surveillance systems often underrepresent user experiences. In this
study, we leverage social media (specifically Twitter) as a rich and unfiltered
source of user-reported effects associated with three emerging psychoactive
substances: ecstasy, GHB, and 2C-B. By combining a curated list of slang terms
with biomedical concept extraction via MetaMap, we identified and weakly
annotated over 92,000 tweets mentioning these substances. Each tweet was
labeled with a polarity reflecting whether it reported a positive or negative
effect, following an expert-guided heuristic process. We then performed
descriptive and comparative analyses of the reported phenotypic outcomes across
substances and trained multiple machine learning classifiers to predict
polarity from tweet content, accounting for strong class imbalance using
techniques such as cost-sensitive learning and synthetic oversampling. The top
performance on the test set was obtained from eXtreme Gradient Boosting with
cost-sensitive learning (F1 = 0.885, AUPRC = 0.934). Our findings reveal that
Twitter enables the detection of substance-specific phenotypic effects, and
that polarity classification models can support real-time pharmacovigilance and
drug effect characterization with high accuracy.

Abstract: The process by which Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire complex
capabilities during training remains a key open question in mechanistic
interpretability. This project investigates whether these learning dynamics can
be characterized through the lens of Complex Network Theory (CNT). I introduce
a novel methodology to represent a Transformer-based LLM as a directed,
weighted graph where nodes are the model's computational components (attention
heads and MLPs) and edges represent causal influence, measured via an
intervention-based ablation technique. By tracking the evolution of this
component-graph across 143 training checkpoints of the Pythia-14M model on a
canonical induction task, I analyze a suite of graph-theoretic metrics. The
results reveal that the network's structure evolves through distinct phases of
exploration, consolidation, and refinement. Specifically, I identify the
emergence of a stable hierarchy of information spreader components and a
dynamic set of information gatherer components, whose roles reconfigure at key
learning junctures. This work demonstrates that a component-level network
perspective offers a powerful macroscopic lens for visualizing and
understanding the self-organizing principles that drive the formation of
functional circuits in LLMs.

Abstract: The team formation and routing problem is a challenging optimization problem

the team formation and routing problem that leverages graph neural networks for
these predictions. Computational experiments demonstrate that applying our
strategy enhances the solution method and outperforms traditional partial
column generation approaches from the literature, particularly on hard
instances solved under a tight time limit.

Conclusion: 结构化数据设计、推理导向初始化与可验证强化学习能推动医学AI超越单纯精度优化，实现更安全可靠临床应用。

Abstract: While large language models show promise in medical applications, achieving
expert-level clinical reasoning remains challenging due to the need for both
accurate answers and transparent reasoning processes. To address this
challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical
reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our
Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets
with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented
diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning
trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third,
we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core
reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive
hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers
substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much
larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and
consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results
demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and
verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple
accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent,
reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment
in high-stakes clinical environments.

Abstract: Printed Electronics (PE) provide a flexible, cost-efficient alternative to

Conclusion: 生物启发的同步动力学可作为生成模型的有效结构先验，提升方向结构图像的建模能力。

Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit
coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using
standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion.
Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we
propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging
stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical
systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled
oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for
structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs
\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally
coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,
gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The
reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse
patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach
enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical
generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale
details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware
networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive
results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation
quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired
synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) involves acquiring and accumulating knowledge from
evolving tasks while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, leveraging
contrastive loss to construct more transferable and less forgetful
representations has been a promising direction in CL. Despite advancements,
their performance is still limited due to confusion arising from both
inter-task and intra-task features. To address the problem, we propose a simple
yet effective contrastive strategy named \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{P}re-fixing,
\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}djusting for \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{C}ontrastive
learning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the
entire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with
the centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \textbf{E}quiangular
\textbf{T}ight \textbf{F}rame (ETF). Meanwhile, for individual tasks, our
method helps regulate the feature structure and form intra-task adjustable ETFs
within their respective allocated regions. As a result, our method
\textit{simultaneously} ensures discriminative feature structures both between
tasks and within tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing
contrastive continual learning framework. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决保形预测在单次校准中覆盖率波动大的问题

Method: 利用小样本Beta校正调整显著性水平

Result: 以用户定义概率确保预测器达到目标覆盖率

Conclusion: 该方法有效增强实际应用中的风险控制能力

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction sets with
guaranteed marginal coverage. However, in split conformal prediction this
guarantee is training-conditional only in expectation: across many calibration
draws, the average coverage equals the nominal level, but the realized coverage
for a single calibration set may vary substantially. This variance undermines
effective risk control in practical applications. Here we introduce the Small
Sample Beta Correction (SSBC), a plug-and-play adjustment to the conformal
significance level that leverages the exact finite-sample distribution of
conformal coverage to provide probabilistic guarantees, ensuring that with
user-defined probability over the calibration draw, the deployed predictor
achieves at least the desired coverage.

Abstract: Recent work has investigated the capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
as zero-shot models for generating individual-level characteristics (e.g., to
serve as risk models or augment survey datasets). However, when should a user
have confidence that an LLM will provide high-quality predictions for their
particular task? To address this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical
study of LLMs' zero-shot predictive capabilities across a wide range of tabular
prediction tasks. We find that LLMs' performance is highly variable, both on
tasks within the same dataset and across different datasets. However, when the
LLM performs well on the base prediction task, its predicted probabilities
become a stronger signal for individual-level accuracy. Then, we construct
metrics to predict LLMs' performance at the task level, aiming to distinguish
between tasks where LLMs may perform well and where they are likely unsuitable.
We find that some of these metrics, each of which are assessed without labeled
data, yield strong signals of LLMs' predictive performance on new tasks.

Abstract: Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative
algorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to
solve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering
data from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in
critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial
robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid
theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the
presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we
study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with
$l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method.
Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized
unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial
Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial
generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with
respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical
analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further
present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating
our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the
family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial
robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.

TL;DR: 提出AC-SMFG算法解决Stackelberg平均场博弈中的策略优化问题，具备有限时间收敛性且实证表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在样本效率低、依赖强假设、缺乏收敛保证等局限，亟需更高效稳健的算法。

Method: 设计单循环Actor-Critic算法AC-SMFG，交替更新领导者、代表性跟随者与平均场，基于连续生成的马尔可夫样本。

Result: 理论证明算法在有限时间和样本下收敛至平稳点，仿真显示其在策略质量与收敛速度上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: AC-SMFG是首个具备非渐近收敛保证的Stackelberg MFG算法，且‘梯度对齐’假设更宽松，实用性强。

Abstract: We study policy optimization in Stackelberg mean field games (MFGs), a
hierarchical framework for modeling the strategic interaction between a single
leader and an infinitely large population of homogeneous followers. The
objective can be formulated as a structured bi-level optimization problem, in
which the leader needs to learn a policy maximizing its reward, anticipating
the response of the followers. Existing methods for solving these (and related)
problems often rely on restrictive independence assumptions between the
leader's and followers' objectives, use samples inefficiently due to
nested-loop algorithm structure, and lack finite-time convergence guarantees.
To address these limitations, we propose AC-SMFG, a single-loop actor-critic
algorithm that operates on continuously generated Markovian samples. The
algorithm alternates between (semi-)gradient updates for the leader, a
representative follower, and the mean field, and is simple to implement in
practice. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the
algorithm to a stationary point of the Stackelberg objective. To our knowledge,
this is the first Stackelberg MFG algorithm with non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees. Our key assumption is a "gradient alignment" condition, which
requires that the full policy gradient of the leader can be approximated by a
partial component of it, relaxing the existing leader-follower independence
assumption. Simulation results in a range of well-established economics
environments demonstrate that AC-SMFG outperforms existing multi-agent and MFG
learning baselines in policy quality and convergence speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VMDNet是一种新的时间序列预测框架，通过样本级VMD分解、频率感知嵌入和双层优化，有效避免信息泄露并自适应调参，在强周期性数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VMD方法存在信息泄露和超参调优不当问题，影响预测效果。

Method: 提出VMDNet框架，结合样本级VMD、频率嵌入、并行TCN和Stackelberg启发式双层优化。

Result: 在两个能源数据集上达到SOTA，尤其在强周期性条件下表现突出，弱周期性下仍保持稳健。

Conclusion: VMDNet能有效捕捉周期结构，提升时间序列预测性能，具备实用推广价值。

Abstract: In time series forecasting, capturing recurrent temporal patterns is
essential; decomposition techniques make such structure explicit and thereby
improve predictive performance. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is a
powerful signal-processing method for periodicity-aware decomposition and has
seen growing adoption in recent years. However, existing studies often suffer
from information leakage and rely on inappropriate hyperparameter tuning. To
address these issues, we propose VMDNet, a causality-preserving framework that
(i) applies sample-wise VMD to avoid leakage; (ii) represents each decomposed
mode with frequency-aware embeddings and decodes it using parallel temporal
convolutional networks (TCNs), ensuring mode independence and efficient
learning; and (iii) introduces a bilevel, Stackelberg-inspired optimisation to
adaptively select VMD's two core hyperparameters: the number of modes (K) and
the bandwidth penalty (alpha). Experiments on two energy-related datasets
demonstrate that VMDNet achieves state-of-the-art results when periodicity is
strong, showing clear advantages in capturing structured periodic patterns
while remaining robust under weak periodicity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在随机优化中缺乏自适应性，无法在不同噪声水平下自动达到最优收敛速率。

Method: 结合动量归一化技术与新颖的自适应参数选择策略。

Result: 在T次迭代中达到$\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{\bar{\sigma}}/T^{1/4})$的梯度范数收敛速率，适用于高低噪声环境。

Conclusion: 首次为随机分层优化提供了自适应且紧致的收敛性保证，实验验证了算法在合成与深度学习任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Hierarchical optimization refers to problems with interdependent decision
variables and objectives, such as minimax and bilevel formulations. While
various algorithms have been proposed, existing methods and analyses lack
adaptivity in stochastic optimization settings: they cannot achieve optimal
convergence rates across a wide spectrum of gradient noise levels without prior
knowledge of the noise magnitude. In this paper, we propose novel adaptive
algorithms for two important classes of stochastic hierarchical optimization
problems: nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization and
nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization. Our algorithms achieve sharp
convergence rates of $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{\bar{\sigma}}/T^{1/4})$
in $T$ iterations for the gradient norm, where $\bar{\sigma}$ is an upper bound
on the stochastic gradient noise. Notably, these rates are obtained without
prior knowledge of the noise level, thereby enabling automatic adaptivity in
both low and high-noise regimes. To our knowledge, this work provides the first
adaptive and sharp convergence guarantees for stochastic hierarchical
optimization. Our algorithm design combines the momentum normalization
technique with novel adaptive parameter choices. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and deep learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithms.

Result: 在CARLA仿真器中，DA-IBC优于标准IBC，能有效建模多模态动作分布。

Conclusion: DA-IBC成功解决了标准BC在多模态行为学习中的局限性。

Abstract: Standard Behavior Cloning (BC) fails to learn multimodal driving decisions,
where multiple valid actions exist for the same scenario. We explore Implicit
Behavioral Cloning (IBC) with Energy-Based Models (EBMs) to better capture this
multimodality. We propose Data-Augmented IBC (DA-IBC), which improves learning
by perturbing expert actions to form the counterexamples of IBC training and
using better initialization for derivative-free inference. Experiments in the
CARLA simulator with Bird's-Eye View inputs demonstrate that DA-IBC outperforms
standard IBC in urban driving tasks designed to evaluate multimodal behavior
learning in a test environment. The learned energy landscapes are able to
represent multimodal action distributions, which BC fails to achieve.

Result: 理论保证高概率正确排序，仿真与基因组学案例均显示优于流行方法。

Conclusion: RAMPART为特征排序提供高效可靠新方案，具广泛科学与决策应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate ranking of important features is a fundamental challenge in
interpretable machine learning with critical applications in scientific
discovery and decision-making. Unlike feature selection and feature importance,
the specific problem of ranking important features has received considerably
less attention. We introduce RAMPART (Ranked Attributions with MiniPatches And
Recursive Trimming), a framework that utilizes any existing feature importance
measure in a novel algorithm specifically tailored for ranking the top-$k$
features. Our approach combines an adaptive sequential halving strategy that
progressively focuses computational resources on promising features with an
efficient ensembling technique using both observation and feature subsampling.
Unlike existing methods that convert importance scores to ranks as
post-processing, our framework explicitly optimizes for ranking accuracy. We
provide theoretical guarantees showing that RAMPART achieves the correct
top-$k$ ranking with high probability under mild conditions, and demonstrate
through extensive simulation studies that RAMPART consistently outperforms
popular feature importance methods, concluding with a high-dimensional genomics
case study.

Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据噪声大、异质性强，传统PCA虽稳健但需改进以提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法兼顾PCA可解释性与稀疏性优势，为单细胞数据分析提供稳健、自动化的新工具。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells
but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR
amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency,
making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous
datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on
principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its
interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix
Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal
components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel
biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that
simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use
of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering
sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains
the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of
sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and
four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves
the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-,
autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态/层次化数据提供理论最优、结构自适应的注意力机制，具良好泛化性与实用性。

Abstract: Transformers and their attention mechanism have been revolutionary in the
field of Machine Learning. While originally proposed for the language data,
they quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities
with various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the
attention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales
from potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to
incorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based
on ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar
problems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in
this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a
mathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then
mathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct
from the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived
formulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard
Softmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the
hierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an
efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived
attention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the
proposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train
transformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it
can also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained
transformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in
zero-shot manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合精度量化方法在低于4比特时因忽略层间交互而性能下降，需更优方案支持低资源部署。

Method: 提出SPQE计算层敏感度与交互，再用IMPQ将其转为二元二次优化问题，分配2或4比特精度。

Result: 在Llama-3等模型上，IMPQ相比基线在2-4比特下困惑度降低20%-80%，且比特越低优势越明显。

Conclusion: IMPQ有效建模层间交互，显著提升极低比特混合精度量化的性能，推动大模型低资源部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise impressive capabilities, yet their
multi-billion-parameter scale makes on-device or low-resource deployment
prohibitive. Mixed-precision quantization offers a compelling solution, but
existing methods struggle when the average precision drops below four bits, as
they rely on isolated, layer-specific metrics that overlook critical
inter-layer interactions affecting overall performance. In this paper, we
propose two innovations to address these limitations. First, we frame the
mixed-precision quantization problem as a cooperative game among layers and
introduce Shapley-based Progressive Quantization Estimation (SPQE) to
efficiently obtain accurate Shapley estimates of layer sensitivities and
inter-layer interactions. Second, building upon SPQE, we propose
Interaction-aware Mixed-Precision Quantization (IMPQ) which translates these
Shapley estimates into a binary quadratic optimization formulation, assigning
either 2 or 4-bit precision to layers under strict memory constraints.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen-3 models
across three independent PTQ backends (Quanto, HQQ, GPTQ) demonstrate IMPQ's
scalability and consistently superior performance compared to methods relying
solely on isolated metrics. Across average precisions spanning 4 bit down to 2
bit, IMPQ cuts Perplexity by 20 to 80 percent relative to the best baseline,
with the margin growing as the bit-width tightens.

Motivation: 解决LLM在时序动态知识推理中的不足，弥补静态知识图谱的缺陷。

Method: 提出EvoReasoner算法进行多跳时序推理，并通过EvoKG模块实现噪声容忍的增量式知识图谱更新。

Result: 在时序问答基准和端到端动态更新场景中超越现有方法，8B模型性能媲美671B模型。

Conclusion: 时序推理与知识图谱动态演化结合，可显著增强LLM对动态知识的处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many language understanding tasks but
struggle to reason over knowledge that evolves. To address this, recent work
has explored augmenting LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) to provide structured,
up-to-date information. However, many existing approaches assume a static
snapshot of the KG and overlook the temporal dynamics and factual
inconsistencies inherent in real-world data. To address the challenge of
reasoning over temporally shifting knowledge, we propose EvoReasoner, a
temporal-aware multi-hop reasoning algorithm that performs global-local entity
grounding, multi-route decomposition, and temporally grounded scoring. To
ensure that the underlying KG remains accurate and up-to-date, we introduce
EvoKG, a noise-tolerant KG evolution module that incrementally updates the KG
from unstructured documents through confidence-based contradiction resolution
and temporal trend tracking. We evaluate our approach on temporal QA benchmarks
and a novel end-to-end setting where the KG is dynamically updated from raw
documents. Our method outperforms both prompting-based and KG-enhanced
baselines, effectively narrowing the gap between small and large LLMs on
dynamic question answering. Notably, an 8B-parameter model using our approach
matches the performance of a 671B model prompted seven months later. These
results highlight the importance of combining temporal reasoning with KG
evolution for robust and up-to-date LLM performance. Our code is publicly
available at github.com/junhongmit/TREK.

Abstract: Accurate solar forecasting underpins effective renewable energy management.
We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global
horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from
site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or
satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To
deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three
classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural
components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station
identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors
(e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural
network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across
stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It
outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse
geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top
commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and
generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.

Abstract: Given a set of financial transactions (who buys from whom, when, and for how
much), as well as prior information from buyers and sellers, how can we find
fraudulent transactions? If we have labels for some transactions for known
types of fraud, we can build a classifier. However, we also want to find new
types of fraud, still unknown to the domain experts ('Detection'). Moreover, we
also want to provide evidence to experts that supports our opinion
('Justification'). In this paper, we propose FRAUDGUESS, to achieve two goals:
(a) for 'Detection', it spots new types of fraud as micro-clusters in a
carefully designed feature space; (b) for 'Justification', it uses
visualization and heatmaps for evidence, as well as an interactive dashboard
for deep dives. FRAUDGUESS is used in real life and is currently considered for
deployment in an Anonymous Financial Institution (AFI). Thus, we also present
the three new behaviors that FRAUDGUESS discovered in a real, million-scale
financial dataset. Two of these behaviors are deemed fraudulent or suspicious
by domain experts, catching hundreds of fraudulent transactions that would
otherwise go un-noticed.

Conclusion: WIEN-INR 是适用于高保真科学数据编码的实用框架，尤其适合需高效保留细节的应用场景。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a compact and
parametric alternative to discrete array-based data representations, encoding
information directly in neural network weights to enable resolution-independent
representation and memory efficiency. However, existing INR approaches, when
constrained to compact network sizes, struggle to faithfully represent the
multi-scale structures, high-frequency information, and fine textures that
characterize the majority of scientific datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose WIEN-INR, a wavelet-informed implicit neural representation that
distributes modeling across different resolution scales and employs a
specialized kernel network at the finest scale to recover subtle details. This
multi-scale architecture allows for the use of smaller networks to retain the
full spectrum of information while preserving the training efficiency and
reducing storage cost. Through extensive experiments on diverse scientific
datasets spanning different scales and structural complexities, WIEN-INR
achieves superior reconstruction fidelity while maintaining a compact model
size. These results demonstrate WIEN-INR as a practical neural representation
framework for high-fidelity scientific data encoding, extending the
applicability of INRs to domains where efficient preservation of fine detail is
essential.

Result: 在连续控制任务中，相比ODT显著提升样本效率与平均回报，尤其在训练早期。

Conclusion: EWA-VQ-ODT计算高效、可解释，具理论保证，是增强在线决策Transformer的有效方法。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a compelling architecture for sequential
decision-making by modeling trajectories via self-attention. In reinforcement
learning (RL), they enable return-conditioned control without relying on value
function approximation. Decision Transformers (DTs) exploit this by casting RL
as supervised sequence modeling, but they are restricted to offline data and
lack exploration. Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) address this limitation
through entropy-regularized training on on-policy rollouts, offering a stable
alternative to traditional RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic, which depend on
bootstrapped targets and reward shaping. Despite these advantages, ODTs use
standard attention, which lacks explicit memory of action-specific outcomes.
This leads to inefficiencies in learning long-term action effectiveness.
Inspired by cognitive models such as Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA), we
propose Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization for Online
Decision Transformers (EWA-VQ-ODT), a lightweight module that maintains
per-action mental accounts summarizing recent successes and failures.
Continuous actions are routed via direct grid lookup to a compact
vector-quantized codebook, where each code stores a scalar attraction updated
online through decay and reward-based reinforcement. These attractions modulate
attention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no
change to the backbone or training objective. On standard continuous-control
benchmarks, EWA-VQ-ODT improves sample efficiency and average return over ODT,
particularly in early training. The module is computationally efficient,
interpretable via per-code traces, and supported by theoretical guarantees that
bound the attraction dynamics and its impact on attention drift.

Motivation: 许多实际问题需要在参数未知的情况下进行决策，传统动态规划方法不适用。

Method: 采用贝叶斯估计与一致风险度量，结合策略梯度与对偶表示，扩展包络定理至连续情形。

Result: 算法收敛速率为$O(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})$，并扩展至情节式设定，给出达到误差界$O(\epsilon)$所需的迭代次数上界。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效处理参数不确定下的风险敏感决策问题，具备理论收敛保证。

Abstract: Motivated by many application problems, we consider Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with a general loss function and unknown parameters. To mitigate the
epistemic uncertainty associated with unknown parameters, we take a Bayesian
approach to estimate the parameters from data and impose a coherent risk
functional (with respect to the Bayesian posterior distribution) on the loss.
Since this formulation usually does not satisfy the interchangeability
principle, it does not admit Bellman equations and cannot be solved by
approaches based on dynamic programming. Therefore, We propose a policy
gradient optimization method, leveraging the dual representation of coherent
risk measures and extending the envelope theorem to continuous cases. We then
show the stationary analysis of the algorithm with a convergence rate of
$O(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})$, where $T$ is the number of policy gradient iterations
and $r$ is the sample size of the gradient estimator. We further extend our
algorithm to an episodic setting, and establish the global convergence of the
extended algorithm and provide bounds on the number of iterations needed to
achieve an error bound $O(\epsilon)$ in each episode.

lifting trajectories into a higher-dimensional space. The framework follows a
two-stage design: first, a probabilistic neural goal estimator predicts
plausible long-term targets, specifying where to go; second, a Koopman
operator-based refinement module incorporates intention and history into a
nonlinear feature space, enabling linear prediction that dictates how to go.
This dual structure not only ensures strong predictive accuracy but also
inherits the favorable properties of linear operators while faithfully
capturing nonlinear dynamics. As a result, our model offers three key
advantages: (i) competitive accuracy, (ii) interpretability grounded in Koopman
spectral theory, and (iii) low-latency deployment. We validate these benefits
on ETH/UCY, the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, and nuScenes, which feature rich
multi-agent interactions and map-constrained nonlinear motion. Across
benchmarks, KoopCast consistently delivers high predictive accuracy together
with mode-level interpretability and practical efficiency.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional data often lie on or
near a low-dimensional manifold. Estimating the dimension of this manifold is
essential for leveraging its structure, yet existing work on dimension
estimation is fragmented and lacks systematic evaluation. This article provides
a comprehensive survey for both researchers and practitioners. We review
often-overlooked theoretical foundations and present eight representative
estimators. Through controlled experiments, we analyze how individual factors
such as noise, curvature, and sample size affect performance. We also compare
the estimators on diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, introducing a
principled approach to dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. Our results
offer practical guidance and suggest that, for a problem of this generality,
simpler methods often perform better.

Motivation: 现有方法无法在完全去中心化设置下同时解决非平稳性和相对过度泛化问题。

Method: 提出DAC方法，将任务形式化为上下文马尔可夫决策过程，利用潜在变量建模动态分布作为上下文，并引入基于上下文的价值函数和乐观边际值。

Result: 在多个合作任务中，DAC优于多个基线方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DAC能有效应对完全去中心化多智能体强化学习中的关键挑战。

Abstract: This paper studies fully decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement
learning, where each agent solely observes the states, its local actions, and
the shared rewards. The inability to access other agents' actions often leads
to non-stationarity during value function updates and relative
overgeneralization during value function estimation, hindering effective
cooperative policy learning. However, existing works fail to address both
issues simultaneously, due to their inability to model the joint policy of
other agents in a fully decentralized setting. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a novel method named Dynamics-Aware Context (DAC), which formalizes the
task, as locally perceived by each agent, as an Contextual Markov Decision
Process, and further addresses both non-stationarity and relative
overgeneralization through dynamics-aware context modeling. Specifically, DAC
attributes the non-stationary local task dynamics of each agent to switches
between unobserved contexts, each corresponding to a distinct joint policy.
Then, DAC models the step-wise dynamics distribution using latent variables and
refers to them as contexts. For each agent, DAC introduces a context-based
value function to address the non-stationarity issue during value function
update. For value function estimation, an optimistic marginal value is derived
to promote the selection of cooperative actions, thereby addressing the
relative overgeneralization issue. Experimentally, we evaluate DAC on various
cooperative tasks (including matrix game, predator and prey, and SMAC), and its
superior performance against multiple baselines validates its effectiveness.

Result: 在高度非线性、非加性、非高斯噪声系统中优于现有数据驱动方法。

Conclusion: 该模型在理论和实验上均支持通用近似与解析信念传播。

Abstract: Predicting the distribution of future states in a stochastic system, known as
belief propagation, is fundamental to reasoning under uncertainty. However,
nonlinear dynamics often make analytical belief propagation intractable,
requiring approximate methods. When the system model is unknown and must be
learned from data, a key question arises: can we learn a model that (i)
universally approximates general nonlinear stochastic dynamics, and (ii)
supports analytical belief propagation? This paper establishes the theoretical
foundations for a class of models that satisfy both properties. The proposed
approach combines the expressiveness of normalizing flows for density
estimation with the analytical tractability of Bernstein polynomials. Empirical
results show the efficacy of our learned model over state-of-the-art
data-driven methods for belief propagation, especially for highly non-linear
systems with non-additive, non-Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: 实验验证了算法在重尾噪声下的有效性

Abstract: Existing decentralized stochastic optimization methods assume the lower-level
loss function is strongly convex and the stochastic gradient noise has finite
variance. These strong assumptions typically are not satisfied in real-world
machine learning models. To address these limitations, we develop a novel
decentralized stochastic bilevel optimization algorithm for the nonconvex
bilevel optimization problem under heavy-tailed noises. Specifically, we
develop a normalized stochastic variance-reduced bilevel gradient descent
algorithm, which does not rely on any clipping operation. Moreover, we
establish its convergence rate by innovatively bounding interdependent gradient
sequences under heavy-tailed noises for nonconvex decentralized bilevel
optimization problems. As far as we know, this is the first decentralized
bilevel optimization algorithm with rigorous theoretical guarantees under
heavy-tailed noises. The extensive experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of our algorithm in handling heavy-tailed noises.

Result: 攻击成功率提升至84%，低分辨率估计可迁移至高分辨率，检测器经增强后性能提升30%。

Conclusion: PolyJuice有效突破黑盒检测器，同时可作为增强训练数据提升检测器性能。

Abstract: Synthetic image detectors (SIDs) are a key defense against the risks posed by
the growing realism of images from text-to-image (T2I) models. Red teaming
improves SID's effectiveness by identifying and exploiting their failure modes
via misclassified synthetic images. However, existing red-teaming solutions (i)
require white-box access to SIDs, which is infeasible for proprietary
state-of-the-art detectors, and (ii) generate image-specific attacks through
expensive online optimization. To address these limitations, we propose
PolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs,
based on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples
correctly and incorrectly classified by the SID. PolyJuice generates attacks by
(i) identifying the direction of this shift through a lightweight offline
process that only requires black-box access to the SID, and (ii) exploiting
this direction by universally steering all generated images towards the SID's
failure modes. PolyJuice-steered T2I models are significantly more effective at
deceiving SIDs (up to 84%) compared to their unsteered counterparts. We also
show that the steering directions can be estimated efficiently at lower
resolutions and transferred to higher resolutions using simple interpolation,
reducing computational overhead. Finally, tuning SID models on
PolyJuice-augmented datasets notably enhances the performance of the detectors
(up to 30%).

Motivation: 零阶优化中多查询与迭代次数存在权衡，如何最优分配查询预算尚不明确。

Method: 提出投影对齐法ZO-Align，对比简单平均法ZO-Avg，推导多种设定下收敛速率。

Result: ZO-Avg下单查询最优，ZO-Align下多查询更优，实验验证理论结论。

Conclusion: 多查询问题本质是聚合方法选择，非中间查询数选择。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a powerful framework for problems
where explicit gradients are unavailable and have to be approximated using only
queries to function value. The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but
suffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to
improves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off:
under a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the
total number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one
another. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored
question.
  This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze
two aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new
Projection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate
minimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the
dependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex,
non-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg,
we prove that using more than one query per iteration is always
query-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal. On the
contrary, ZO-Align generally performs better with more queries per iteration,
resulting in a full-subspace estimation as the optimal approach. Thus, our work
clarifies that the multi-query problem boils down to a choice not about an
intermediate query size, but between two classic algorithms, a choice dictated
entirely by the aggregation method used. These theoretical findings are also
consistently validated by extensive experiments.

Result: 实验表明新方法减少奖励黑客，推理更规范，准确率优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于提升RLVR在医疗问答中的可靠性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently shown that
large language models (LLMs) can develop their own reasoning without direct
supervision. However, applications in the medical domain, specifically for
question answering, are susceptible to significant reward hacking during the
reasoning phase. Our work addresses two primary forms of this behavior: i)
providing a final answer without preceding reasoning, and ii) employing
non-standard reasoning formats to exploit the reward mechanism. To mitigate
these, we introduce a composite reward function with specific penalties for
these behaviors. Our experiments show that extending RLVR with our proposed
reward model leads to better-formatted reasoning with less reward hacking and
good accuracy compared to the baselines. This approach marks a step toward
reducing reward hacking and enhancing the reliability of models utilizing RLVR.

Conclusion: 小规模LLM结合结构化上下文可有效替代百亿参数模型进行超参数调优。

Abstract: Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML)
pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most
rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block
Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context
Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training
trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze
optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two
locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial
budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9
percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

Abstract: Novel class discovery is essential for ML models to adapt to evolving
real-world data, with applications ranging from scientific discovery to
robotics. However, these datasets contain complex and entangled factors of
variation, making a systematic study of class discovery difficult. As a result,
many fundamental questions are yet to be answered on why and when new class
discoveries are more likely to be successful. To address this, we propose a
simple controlled experimental framework using the dSprites dataset with
procedurally generated modifying factors. This allows us to investigate what
influences successful class discovery. In particular, we study the relationship
between the number of known/unknown classes and discovery performance, as well
as the impact of known class 'coverage' on discovering new classes. Our
empirical results indicate that the benefit of the number of known classes
reaches a saturation point beyond which discovery performance plateaus. The
pattern of diminishing return across different settings provides an insight for
cost-benefit analysis for practitioners and a starting point for more rigorous
future research of class discovery on complex real-world datasets.

Method: 构建共享高斯潜在空间，为每种数据配备编码器/解码器，通过组合实现不同任务。

Result: 在图像生成、表征学习、联合分类与生成任务中均取得领先或改进性能，如CIFAR10上FID提升、ImageNet线性分类超越MoCo与SimCLR。

Conclusion: LZN为多任务机器学习提供统一有效框架，具备实用潜力与扩展性。

Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three
core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA)
solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified
principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and
foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)
as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent
space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,
text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent
zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as
compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional
image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses
an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We
demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN
can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA
Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without
modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently
(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation
learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and
SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear
classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously
(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,
LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA
classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available
at https://github.com/microsoft/latent-zoning-networks. The project website is

Conclusion: 个性化预测方案在保持可解释性的同时具备理论保证与实用性能。

Abstract: In machine learning applications, predictive models are trained to serve
future queries across the entire data distribution. Real-world data often
demands excessively complex models to achieve competitive performance, however,
sacrificing interpretability. Hence, the growing deployment of machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare, motivates the search
for methods for accurate and explainable predictions. This work proposes a
Personalized Prediction scheme, where an easy-to-interpret predictor is learned
per query. In particular, we wish to produce a "sparse linear" classifier with
competitive performance specifically on some sub-population that includes the
query point. The goal of this work is to study the PAC-learnability of this
prediction model for sub-populations represented by "halfspaces" in a
label-agnostic setting. We first give a distribution-specific PAC-learning
algorithm for learning reference classes for personalized prediction. By
leveraging both the reference-class learning algorithm and a list learner of
sparse linear representations, we prove the first upper bound,
$O(\mathrm{opt}^{1/4} )$, for personalized prediction with sparse linear
classifiers and homogeneous halfspace subsets. We also evaluate our algorithms
on a variety of standard benchmark data sets.

Abstract: In the age of information overload, content management for online news

summarization by employing advanced machine learning techniques to generate
concise and coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning. Using the
Cornell Newsroom dataset, comprising 1.3 million article-summary pairs, we
developed a pipeline leveraging BERT embeddings to transform textual data into
numerical representations. By framing the task as a binary classification
problem, we explored various models, including logistic regression,
feed-forward neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Our
findings demonstrate that LSTM networks, with their ability to capture
sequential dependencies, outperform baseline methods like Lede-3 and simpler
models in F1 score and ROUGE-1 metrics. This study underscores the potential of
automated summarization in improving content management systems for online news
platforms, enabling more efficient content organization and enhanced user

Abstract: We highlight a fundamental connection between information geometry and

certain conditions, a VB solution always requires estimation or computation of
natural gradients. We show several consequences of this fact by using the
natural-gradient descent algorithm of Khan and Rue (2023) called the Bayesian
Learning Rule (BLR). These include (i) a simplification of Bayes' rule as
addition of natural gradients, (ii) a generalization of quadratic surrogates
used in gradient-based methods, and (iii) a large-scale implementation of VB
algorithms for large language models. Neither the connection nor its
consequences are new but we further emphasize the common origins of the two
fields of information geometry and Bayes with a hope to facilitate more work at
the intersection of the two fields.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升影响函数在大规模模型中的实用性与效率。

Abstract: Assessing the impact the training data on machine learning models is crucial
for understanding the behavior of the model, enhancing the transparency, and
selecting training data. Influence function provides a theoretical framework
for quantifying the effect of training data points on model's performance given
a specific test data. However, the computational and memory costs of influence
function presents significant challenges, especially for large-scale models,
even when using approximation methods, since the gradients involved in
computation are as large as the model itself. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach that leverages dropout as a gradient compression mechanism to
compute the influence function more efficiently. Our method significantly
reduces computational and memory overhead, not only during the influence
function computation but also in gradient compression process. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that our method
could preserves critical components of the data influence and enables its
application to modern large-scale models.

Conclusion: 所提方法兼具理论保证与实际性能优势，适用于复杂强化学习特征选择任务。

Abstract: This work proposes an efficient batch algorithm for feature selection in
reinforcement learning (RL) with theoretical convergence guarantees. To
mitigate the estimation bias inherent in conventional regularization schemes,
the first contribution extends policy evaluation within the classical
least-squares temporal-difference (LSTD) framework by formulating a
Bellman-residual objective regularized with the sparsity-inducing, nonconvex
projected minimax concave (PMC) penalty. Owing to the weak convexity of the PMC
penalty, this formulation can be interpreted as a special instance of a general
nonmonotone-inclusion problem. The second contribution establishes novel
convergence conditions for the forward-reflected-backward splitting (FRBS)
algorithm to solve this class of problems. Numerical experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art feature-selection methods, particularly in scenarios with many
noisy features.

Conclusion: H2T2为边缘分层推理系统提供高效、自适应、模型无关的在线优化方案，显著提升成本敏感场景下的实用性能。

Abstract: We focus on a binary classification problem in an edge intelligence system
where false negatives are more costly than false positives. The system has a
compact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote
model, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For
each sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference.
Based on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the
remote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between
classification accuracy and these offloading costs within such a hierarchical
inference (HI) system. To optimize this system, we propose an online learning
framework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's
confidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model
and whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We
present a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is
calibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce
H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it
achieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and
learns in the inference phase using limited feedback. Simulations on real-world
datasets show that H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold HI
policies, sometimes even surpassing offline optima. The policy also
demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and adapts effectively to
mismatched classifiers.

Conclusion: 结构感知与多样性引导的示例选择能有效提升上下文学习性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to new and data-scarce tasks using only a few
carefully selected task-specific examples presented in the prompt. However,
given the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Which
examples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query?
While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for
this purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional
embedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In
this work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled,
information theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear
function over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a
query-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a
larger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query.
This formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning
theoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query
instance. We derive a principled surrogate objective that is approximately
submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm with an approximation
guarantee. We further enhance our method by (i) incorporating the kernel trick
to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mappings, and
(ii) introducing an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity in
the selected examples. Empirically, we demonstrate significant improvements
over standard retrieval methods across a suite of classification tasks,
highlighting the benefits of structure-aware, diverse example selection for ICL
in real-world, label-scarce scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型深度学习模型在边缘设备部署时的高计算与存储开销问题。

Method: 基于随机矩阵理论的谱分析，逐层保留信息方向并结合自蒸馏进行压缩。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现80%参数压缩、2.8倍推理加速与近半功耗降低，精度损失仅2%。

Conclusion: RMT-KD为网络蒸馏提供了一种数学基础扎实且高效实用的新方法。

Abstract: Large deep learning models such as BERT and ResNet achieve state-of-the-art
performance but are costly to deploy at the edge due to their size and compute
demands. We present RMT-KD, a compression method that leverages Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for knowledge distillation to iteratively reduce network size.
Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only
informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden
representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with
self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE, AG News, and
CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy
loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption.
These results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network
distillation.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中何时模仿演示动作的难题，克服现有方法的二元决策缺陷。

Method: 使用集成方法建模Q值分布，提出概率法和优势法两种不确定性感知的连续正则化策略。

Result: 在8个机器人任务中显著优于现有方法，复杂任务提升达14倍，且对演示质量和数量鲁棒。

Conclusion: SPReD框架有效平衡模仿与自主策略，提升训练稳定性和性能，具实用价值。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, demonstrations can accelerate
learning, but determining when to imitate them remains challenging. We propose
Smooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that
addresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a
demonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to
explicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy
actions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary
uncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood
of demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation
by statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that
make binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous,
uncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance
during training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves
remarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming
existing approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining
robustness to demonstration quality and quantity. Our code is available at
https://github.com/YujieZhu7/SPReD.

Motivation: 大语言模型易出现幻觉和分布外错误，现有检测方法存在效率或可解释性不足的问题。

Method: 通过流式计算协方差谱统计量（如熵、特征值间隙、KL散度），输入轻量级循环分类器，追踪表征结构的时间变化。

Result: 该方法仅需单次前向传播，保留时间上下文，聚合全局信号，提供可解释的精度-延迟权衡。

Conclusion: EigenTrack在效率、可解释性和检测能力上优于现有黑箱、灰箱和白箱方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer broad utility but remain prone to
hallucination and out-of-distribution (OOD) errors. We propose EigenTrack, an
interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden
activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming
covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL
divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier,
EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal
hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and
grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling.
Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates
global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Method: 比较物理模型、经验修正系数与数据驱动神经网络，将机龄作为输入特征或乘性偏差引入模型。

Result: 基线模型对老旧飞机燃油消耗低估，年龄相关修正与神经网络显著降低偏差、提升精度。

Conclusion: 参数与机器学习框架需纳入老化效应以提升评估可靠性，同时需更丰富数据以捕捉真实发动机退化复杂性。

Abstract: Accurate modelling of aircraft fuel-flow is crucial for both operational
planning and environmental impact assessment, yet standard parametric models
often neglect performance deterioration that occurs as aircraft age. This paper
investigates multiple approaches to integrate engine ageing effects into
fuel-flow prediction for the Airbus A320-214, using a comprehensive dataset of
approximately nineteen thousand Quick Access Recorder flights from nine
distinct airframes with varying years in service. We systematically evaluate
classical physics-based models, empirical correction coefficients, and
data-driven neural network architectures that incorporate age either as an
input feature or as an explicit multiplicative bias. Results demonstrate that
while baseline models consistently underestimate fuel consumption for older
aircraft, the use of age-dependent correction factors and neural models
substantially reduces bias and improves prediction accuracy. Nevertheless,
limitations arise from the small number of airframes and the lack of detailed
maintenance event records, which constrain the representativeness and
generalization of age-based corrections. This study emphasizes the importance
of accounting for the effects of ageing in parametric and machine learning
frameworks to improve the reliability of operational and environmental
assessments. The study also highlights the need for more diverse datasets that
can capture the complexity of real-world engine deterioration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI轨迹数据稀缺，手动标注成本高，合成方法在多样性与任务覆盖间难以平衡。

Method: GUI-ReWalk采用随机探索模拟人类试错，再通过目标推理引导连贯交互，并支持跨应用的长程任务生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GUI-ReWalk生成的数据覆盖更广、轨迹熵更高、用户意图更真实。

Conclusion: GUI-ReWalk是可扩展、数据高效的框架，推动GUI智能体研究与实际自动化应用。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, powered by large language and
vision-language models, hold promise for enabling end-to-end automation in
digital environments. However, their progress is fundamentally constrained by
the scarcity of scalable, high-quality trajectory data. Existing data
collection strategies either rely on costly and inconsistent manual annotations
or on synthetic generation methods that trade off between diversity and
meaningful task coverage. To bridge this gap, we present GUI-ReWalk: a
reasoning-enhanced, multi-stage framework for synthesizing realistic and
diverse GUI trajectories. GUI-ReWalk begins with a stochastic exploration phase
that emulates human trial-and-error behaviors, and progressively transitions
into a reasoning-guided phase where inferred goals drive coherent and
purposeful interactions. Moreover, it supports multi-stride task generation,
enabling the construction of long-horizon workflows across multiple
applications. By combining randomness for diversity with goal-aware reasoning
for structure, GUI-ReWalk produces data that better reflects the intent-aware,
adaptive nature of human-computer interaction. We further train Qwen2.5-VL-7B
on the GUI-ReWalk dataset and evaluate it across multiple benchmarks, including
Screenspot-Pro, OSWorld-G, UI-Vision, AndroidControl, and GUI-Odyssey. Results
demonstrate that GUI-ReWalk enables superior coverage of diverse interaction
flows, higher trajectory entropy, and more realistic user intent. These
findings establish GUI-ReWalk as a scalable and data-efficient framework for
advancing GUI agent research and enabling robust real-world automation.

Method: 改进FSNet，采用单样本单次学习模式，利用线性回归生成伪目标并持续更新模型。

Result: 在平滑退化数据集上RMSE为0.00197、MAE为0.00154；在含容量再生尖峰的数据集上RMSE为0.01588、MAE为0.01234。

Conclusion: iFSNet结合伪目标与自适应结构，有效提升在线多步预测性能。

Abstract: Data-driven models accurately perform early battery prognosis to prevent
equipment failure and further safety hazards. Most existing machine learning
(ML) models work in offline mode which must consider their retraining
post-deployment every time new data distribution is encountered. Hence, there
is a need for an online ML approach where the model can adapt to varying
distributions. However, existing online incremental multistep forecasts are a
great challenge as there is no way to correct the model of its forecasts at the
current instance. Also, these methods need to wait for a considerable amount of
time to acquire enough streaming data before retraining. In this study, we
propose iFSNet (incremental Fast and Slow learning Network) which is a modified
version of FSNet for a single-pass mode (sample-by-sample) to achieve multistep
forecasting using pseudo targets. It uses a simple linear regressor of the
input sequence to extrapolate pseudo future samples (pseudo targets) and
calculate the loss from the rest of the forecast and keep updating the model.
The model benefits from the associative memory and adaptive structure
mechanisms of FSNet, at the same time the model incrementally improves by using
pseudo targets. The proposed model achieved 0.00197 RMSE and 0.00154 MAE on
datasets with smooth degradation trajectories while it achieved 0.01588 RMSE
and 0.01234 MAE on datasets having irregular degradation trajectories with
capacity regeneration spikes.

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效引导LLM内部表征，使其在不同群体间表现一致，实现无公平-效用权衡的理想分布。

Abstract: To fix the 'bias in, bias out' problem in fair machine learning, it is
important to steer feature distributions of data or internal representations of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to ideal ones that guarantee group-fair outcomes.
Previous work on fair generative models and representation steering could
greatly benefit from provable fairness guarantees on the model output. We
define a distribution as ideal if the minimizer of any cost-sensitive risk on
it is guaranteed to have exact group-fair outcomes (e.g., demographic parity,
equal opportunity)-in other words, it has no fairness-utility trade-off. We
formulate an optimization program for optimal steering by finding the nearest
ideal distribution in KL-divergence, and provide efficient algorithms for it
when the underlying distributions come from well-known parametric families
(e.g., normal, log-normal). Empirically, our optimal steering techniques on
both synthetic and real-world datasets improve fairness without diminishing
utility (and sometimes even improve utility). We demonstrate affine steering of
LLM representations to reduce bias in multi-class classification, e.g.,
occupation prediction from a short biography in Bios dataset (De-Arteaga et
al.). Furthermore, we steer internal representations of LLMs towards desired
outputs so that it works equally well across different groups.

Motivation: 当前半导体制造依赖启发式规则进行产能规划，但难以应对复杂流程交互导致的瓶颈问题。

Method: 采用异构图神经网络表示策略，结合深度强化学习训练，捕捉机器与工序间的复杂关系，实现前瞻性决策。

Result: 在Intel Minifab和SMT2020测试中，最大场景下吞吐量和周期时间各提升约1.8%。

Conclusion: 该模型能有效处理大规模机器级动作空间，优于传统启发式方法，具备实际部署潜力。

Abstract: In manufacturing, capacity planning is the process of allocating production
resources in accordance with variable demand. The current industry practice in
semiconductor manufacturing typically applies heuristic rules to prioritize
actions, such as future change lists that account for incoming machine and
recipe dedications. However, while offering interpretability, heuristics cannot
easily account for the complex interactions along the process flow that can
gradually lead to the formation of bottlenecks. Here, we present a neural
network-based model for capacity planning on the level of individual machines,
trained using deep reinforcement learning. By representing the policy using a
heterogeneous graph neural network, the model directly captures the diverse
relationships among machines and processing steps, allowing for proactive
decision-making. We describe several measures taken to achieve sufficient
scalability to tackle the vast space of possible machine-level actions.
  Our evaluation results cover Intel's small-scale Minifab model and
preliminary experiments using the popular SMT2020 testbed. In the largest
tested scenario, our trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle
time by about 1.8% each.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注Lookahead优化器在训练数据上的收敛性，其泛化能力缺乏严谨分析，且依赖强假设。

Method: 利用平均模型稳定性，对Lookahead与小批量SGD结合的情形进行稳定性与泛化分析。

Result: 在凸和强凸情形下推导出泛化界，凸情形下实现批量大小的线性加速。

Conclusion: 该分析摆脱了Lipschitz假设限制，更全面揭示了优化与泛化的关系。

Abstract: The Lookahead optimizer enhances deep learning models by employing a
dual-weight update mechanism, which has been shown to improve the performance
of underlying optimizers such as SGD. However, most theoretical studies focus
on its convergence on training data, leaving its generalization capabilities
less understood. Existing generalization analyses are often limited by
restrictive assumptions, such as requiring the loss function to be globally
Lipschitz continuous, and their bounds do not fully capture the relationship
between optimization and generalization. In this paper, we address these issues
by conducting a rigorous stability and generalization analysis of the Lookahead
optimizer with minibatch SGD. We leverage on-average model stability to derive
generalization bounds for both convex and strongly convex problems without the
restrictive Lipschitzness assumption. Our analysis demonstrates a linear
speedup with respect to the batch size in the convex setting.

Conclusion: MCTD-ME为蛋白设计提供高效、可扩展的新范式，框架模型无关，可推广至从头设计与多目标分子生成。

Abstract: The goal of protein design is to generate amino acid sequences that fold into
functional structures with desired properties. Prior methods combining
autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle
with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search
space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts,
which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token
planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME
uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine,
jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It
further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided
by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while
preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule
(PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse
folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and
unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity
(scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from
multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and
applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and
multi-objective molecular generation.

Conclusion: LSRE有效增强MetaBBO的泛化能力，且其设计选择经消融实验验证合理。

Abstract: To relieve intensive human-expertise required to design optimization
algorithms, recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) researches leverage
generalization strength of meta-learning to train neural network-based
algorithm design policies over a predefined training problem set, which
automates the adaptability of the low-level optimizers on unseen problem
instances. Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs
is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the
MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited
in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further
results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance
generation approach, termed as \textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse
training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies.
LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features
into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space
leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity.
By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with
minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a
diversified problem set, termed as \textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the
effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe
their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios.
Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to
existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only
demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal
interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.

Conclusion: ThermalGuardian有效提升汽车深度学习框架在温度变化环境下的鲁棒性与可靠性，为车载AI系统提供关键质量保障。

Abstract: Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems,
supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate
model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive
deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT
in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud,
vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from
-40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally,
heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase.
These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments
through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks
are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency
variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer
critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors,
high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series
operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot
be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they
ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge
this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning
framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically,
ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules
targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature
fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based
on real-time GPU temperature.

Conclusion: 首次证明Muon类优化器可达理论最优，为设计更高效加速变体指明方向。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated remarkable empirical success in handling
matrix-structured parameters for training neural networks. However, a
significant gap persists between its practical performance and theoretical
understanding. Existing analyses indicate that the standard Muon variant
achieves only a suboptimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$ in
stochastic non-convex settings, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. To
explore the theoretical limits of the Muon framework, we construct and analyze
a variance-reduced variant, termed Muon-VR2. We provide the first rigorous
proof that incorporating a variance-reduction mechanism enables Muon-VR2 to
attain an optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, thereby
matching the theoretical lower bound for this class of problems. Moreover, our
analysis establishes convergence guarantees for Muon variants under the
Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) condition. Extensive experiments on vision
(CIFAR-10) and language (C4) benchmarks corroborate our theoretical findings on
per-iteration convergence. Overall, this work provides the first proof of
optimality for a Muon-style optimizer and clarifies the path toward developing
more practically efficient, accelerated variants.

Conclusion: SolarCrossFormer在实际运行中表现稳健，具备高精度、高灵活性和强泛化能力，适合大规模光伏系统并网应用。

Abstract: Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the
large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid.
However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution
required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a
novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines
satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological
stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the
inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy
and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any
location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours
ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real
life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the
model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input
data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of
one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield
a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The
results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather
prediction service.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统求解器因NP难问题效率低，现有LNS方法受限于邻域生成效果。

Method: 提出HyP-ASO框架，用公式计算变量选择概率，RL网络预测邻域大小。

Result: 实验证明HyP-ASO优于现有LNS方法，轻量且高扩展性。

Conclusion: HyP-ASO适合高效求解大规模整数线性规划问题。

Abstract: Directly solving large-scale Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) using traditional
solvers is slow due to their NP-hard nature. While recent frameworks based on
Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) can accelerate the solving process, their
performance is often constrained by the difficulty in generating sufficiently
effective neighborhoods. To address this challenge, we propose HyP-ASO, a
hybrid policy-based adaptive search optimization framework that combines a
customized formula with deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). The formula leverages
feasible solutions to calculate the selection probabilities for each variable
in the neighborhood generation process, and the RL policy network predicts the
neighborhood size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyP-ASO significantly
outperforms existing LNS-based approaches for large-scale ILPs. Additional
experiments show it is lightweight and highly scalable, making it well-suited
for solving large-scale ILPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式AI与隐私医疗中多源异构数据的协同分析难题，同时满足HIPAA合规要求。

Method: 利用热核系数将欧氏距离转为几何感知相似度，设计HK-MVFC与FedHK-MVFC算法，结合差分隐私与安全聚合。

Result: 在心血管数据集上聚类准确率提升8-12%，通信量减少70%，效率保留98.2%，验证于10,000条跨院病历。

Conclusion: 为医疗联邦学习建立几何感知新标准，实现理论严谨性与临床实用性的统一。

Abstract: In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we
propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory
with federated healthcare analytics. Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients
from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware
similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay
this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence
guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy
Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View
Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across
hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate
HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular
patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced
communication, and $98.2 \%$ efficiency retention over centralized methods.
Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for
collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data.
Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence,
adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new
standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, turning advanced
math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while
ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmoHeal是一个基于AI的个性化情绪疗愈系统，结合音乐疗法原理，通过识别27种细粒度情绪并匹配音视频内容，有效改善用户情绪状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字心理健康工具缺乏对个体情绪状态的细致识别与动态适配，尤其在应对睡前焦虑等常见问题时效果有限。

Method: 采用微调的XLM-RoBERTa模型识别用户文本情绪，结合音乐疗法知识图谱（GEMS、iso-principle）映射至音乐参数，利用CLAMP3模型检索音视频内容实现‘匹配-引导-目标’情绪调节。

Result: 40人实验显示显著情绪改善（M=4.12, p<0.001），情绪识别准确度高（M=4.05, p<0.001），且识别准确度与疗效强相关（r=0.72, p<0.001）。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了基于理论、细粒度情绪感知的数字健康工具的可行性，为音乐疗法的AI规模化应用提供蓝图。

Abstract: Existing digital mental wellness tools often overlook the nuanced emotional
states underlying everyday challenges. For example, pre-sleep anxiety affects
more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, yet current approaches remain largely
static and "one-size-fits-all", failing to adapt to individual needs. In this
work, we present EmoHeal, an end-to-end system that delivers personalized,
three-stage supportive narratives. EmoHeal detects 27 fine-grained emotions
from user text with a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model, mapping them to musical
parameters via a knowledge graph grounded in music therapy principles (GEMS,
iso-principle). EmoHeal retrieves audiovisual content using the CLAMP3 model to
guide users from their current state toward a calmer one
("match-guide-target"). A within-subjects study (N=40) demonstrated significant
supportive effects, with participants reporting substantial mood improvement
(M=4.12, p<0.001) and high perceived emotion recognition accuracy (M=4.05,
p<0.001). A strong correlation between perceived accuracy and therapeutic
outcome (r=0.72, p<0.001) validates our fine-grained approach. These findings
establish the viability of theory-driven, emotion-aware digital wellness tools
and provides a scalable AI blueprint for operationalizing music therapy
principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态GNN方法难以捕捉癫痫发作期间脑连接的动态演化，且时序与图结构交互建模不成熟。

Method: 提出显式动态图结构，节点与边随时间演化，结合两流Mamba与增强GCN架构。

Conclusion: 理论与实验证明显式动态建模与time-then-graph策略更有效，EvoBrain为癫痫检测提供新范式。

Abstract: Dynamic GNNs, which integrate temporal and spatial features in
Electroencephalography (EEG) data, have shown great potential in automating
seizure detection. However, fully capturing the underlying dynamics necessary
to represent brain states, such as seizure and non-seizure, remains a
non-trivial task and presents two fundamental challenges. First, most existing
dynamic GNN methods are built on temporally fixed static graphs, which fail to
reflect the evolving nature of brain connectivity during seizure progression.
Second, current efforts to jointly model temporal signals and graph structures
and, more importantly, their interactions remain nascent, often resulting in
inconsistent performance. To address these challenges, we present the first
theoretical analysis of these two problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and
necessity of explicit dynamic modeling and time-then-graph dynamic GNN method.
Building on these insights, we propose EvoBrain, a novel seizure detection
model that integrates a two-stream Mamba architecture with a GCN enhanced by
Laplacian Positional Encoding, following neurological insights. Moreover,
EvoBrain incorporates explicitly dynamic graph structures, allowing both nodes
and edges to evolve over time. Our contributions include (a) a theoretical
analysis proving the expressivity advantage of explicit dynamic modeling and
time-then-graph over other approaches, (b) a novel and efficient model that
significantly improves AUROC by 23% and F1 score by 30%, compared with the
dynamic GNN baseline, and (c) broad evaluations of our method on the
challenging early seizure prediction tasks.

Motivation: LLM虽经安全对齐仍易受越狱攻击，需探索其安全机制分布并设计高效攻击方法。

Method: 在中间层s和e间添加残差连接，绕过中后层安全机制，实现白盒越狱。

Result: 在HarmBench测试集上比最优基线提升51%，且验证集困惑度变化极小。

Conclusion: LLM安全机制集中于中后层，SABER有效揭示其脆弱性，为安全研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with safe-alignment training are powerful
instruments with robust language comprehension capabilities. These models
typically undergo meticulous alignment procedures involving human feedback to
ensure the acceptance of safe inputs while rejecting harmful or unsafe ones.
However, despite their massive scale and alignment efforts, LLMs remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where malicious users manipulate the model to
produce harmful outputs that it was explicitly trained to avoid. In this study,
we find that the safety mechanisms in LLMs are predominantly embedded in the
middle-to-late layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel white-box
jailbreak method, SABER (Safety Alignment Bypass via Extra Residuals), which
connects two intermediate layers $s$ and $e$ such that $s < e$, through a
residual connection. Our approach achieves a 51% improvement over the
best-performing baseline on the HarmBench test set. Furthermore, SABER induces
only a marginal shift in perplexity when evaluated on the HarmBench validation
set. The source code is publicly available at

Result: 在CIFAR-100-LT和Places-LT基准上达到新SOTA，性能优异。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效、结构简单，兼具适应性与实用性。

Abstract: Imbalanced classification datasets pose significant challenges in machine
learning, often leading to biased models that perform poorly on
underrepresented classes. With the rise of foundation models, recent research
has focused on the full, partial, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of these
models to deal with long-tail classification. Despite the impressive
performance of these works on the benchmark datasets, they still fail to close
the gap with the networks trained using the balanced datasets and still require
substantial computational resources, even for relatively smaller datasets.
Underscoring the importance of computational efficiency and simplicity, in this
work we propose a novel framework that leverages the rich semantic latent space
of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data and train a simple
linear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tail
classification. The computational efficiency gain arises from the number of
trainable parameters that are reduced to just the number of parameters in the
linear model. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art for the CIFAR-100-LT
benchmark and demonstrates strong performance on the Places-LT benchmark,
highlighting the effectiveness and adaptability of our simple and effective
approach.

TL;DR: 提出ToFU框架，通过学习过程中的变换减少模型对特定数据的记忆，从而提升联邦遗忘效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦遗忘方法多为事后处理，难以高效清除神经网络深度记忆的数据，需设计更易遗忘的联邦学习系统。

Method: 提出ToFU框架，在训练中引入变换，理论证明其可限制实例特定信息，简化后续遗忘过程。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和MUFAC基准上，ToFU优于现有方法，提升性能并缩短遗忘时间。

Conclusion: ToFU可作为即插即用框架增强现有联邦遗忘方法，实现更高效、理论可证的数据遗忘。

Abstract: Neural networks unintentionally memorize training data, creating privacy
risks in federated learning (FL) systems, such as inference and reconstruction
attacks on sensitive data. To mitigate these risks and to comply with privacy
regulations, Federated Unlearning (FU) has been introduced to enable
participants in FL systems to remove their data's influence from the global
model. However, current FU methods primarily act post-hoc, struggling to
efficiently erase information deeply memorized by neural networks. We argue
that effective unlearning necessitates a paradigm shift: designing FL systems
inherently amenable to forgetting. To this end, we propose a
learning-to-unlearn Transformation-guided Federated Unlearning (ToFU) framework
that incorporates transformations during the learning process to reduce
memorization of specific instances. Our theoretical analysis reveals how
transformation composition provably bounds instance-specific information,
directly simplifying subsequent unlearning. Crucially, ToFU can work as a
plug-and-play framework that improves the performance of existing FU methods.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the MUFAC benchmark show that ToFU
outperforms existing FU baselines, enhances performance when integrated with
current methods, and reduces unlearning time.

Conclusion: 潜伏学习缺失是机器学习数据效率低的可能原因，检索机制可有效辅助参数化学习以提升泛化能力。

Abstract: When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms
could improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive
science to argue that one weakness of machine learning systems is their failure
to exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the
task at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this
perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling
to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive
science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these
issues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval
mechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better
across many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential
components for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of
within-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information
across retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible
contributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning
systems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval
methods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization.

Motivation: 扩散模型采样成本高，现有方法未充分利用语义相似查询间的共享计算。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，结合共享采样方案与定制训练策略，实现效率与质量平衡。

Result: 实验表明SAGE降低25.5%采样成本，FID降低5.0%，CLIP提升5.4%，多样性提高160%。

Conclusion: SAGE有效提升扩散模型效率与生成质量，为实际应用提供更优解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models manifest evident benefits across diverse domains, yet their
high sampling cost, requiring dozens of sequential model evaluations, remains a
major limitation. Prior efforts mainly accelerate sampling via optimized
solvers or distillation, which treat each query independently. In contrast, we
reduce total number of steps by sharing early-stage sampling across
semantically similar queries. To enable such efficiency gains without
sacrificing quality, we propose SAGE, a semantic-aware shared sampling
framework that integrates a shared sampling scheme for efficiency and a
tailored training strategy for quality preservation. Extensive experiments show
that SAGE reduces sampling cost by 25.5%, while improving generation quality
with 5.0% lower FID, 5.4% higher CLIP, and 160% higher diversity over
baselines.

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis primarily relies on manual microscopic analysis of bone
marrow morphology supported by additional laboratory parameters, making it
complex and time consuming. While artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have
been proposed, most utilize private datasets and only cover parts of the
diagnostic pipeline. Therefore, we present a large, high-quality, publicly
available leukemia bone marrow dataset spanning the entire diagnostic process,
from cell detection to diagnosis. Using this dataset, we further propose
methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction. The
dataset comprises 246 pediatric patients with diagnostic, clinical and
laboratory information, over 40 000 cells with bounding box annotations and
more than 28 000 of these with high-quality class labels, making it the most
comprehensive dataset publicly available. Evaluation of the AI models yielded
an average precision of 0.96 for the cell detection, an area under the curve of
0.98, and an F1-score of 0.61 for the 33-class cell classification, and a mean
F1-score of 0.90 for the diagnosis prediction using predicted cell counts.
While the proposed approaches demonstrate their usefulness for AI-assisted
diagnostics, the dataset will foster further research and development in the
field, ultimately contributing to more precise diagnoses and improved patient
outcomes.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning from scratch has shown impressive results in
solving sequential decision-making tasks with efficient simulators, real-world
applications with expensive interactions require more sample-efficient agents.
Foundation models (FMs) are natural candidates to improve sample efficiency as
they possess broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but it is yet unclear
how to effectively integrate them into the reinforcement learning framework. In
this paper, we anticipate and, most importantly, evaluate two promising
strategies. First, we consider the use of foundation world models (FWMs) that
exploit the prior knowledge of FMs to enable training and evaluating agents
with simulated interactions. Second, we consider the use of foundation agents
(FAs) that exploit the reasoning capabilities of FMs for decision-making. We
evaluate both approaches empirically in a family of grid-world environments
that are suitable for the current generation of large language models (LLMs).
Our results suggest that improvements in LLMs already translate into better
FWMs and FAs; that FAs based on current LLMs can already provide excellent
policies for sufficiently simple environments; and that the coupling of FWMs
and reinforcement learning agents is highly promising for more complex settings
with partial observability and stochastic elements.

Result: 在模拟与真实广告系统中均取得领先性能。

Conclusion: AIGB-Pearl有效提升广告自动竞价性能，突破现有方法瓶颈。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is an essential tool for advertisers to enhance their
advertising performance. Recent progress has shown that AI-Generated Bidding
(AIGB), which formulates the auto-bidding as a trajectory generation task and
trains a conditional diffusion-based planner on offline data, achieves superior
and stable performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning
(RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still encounter
a performance bottleneck due to their neglect of fine-grained generation
quality evaluation and inability to explore beyond static datasets. To address
this, we propose AIGB-Pearl (\emph{Planning with EvAluator via RL}), a novel
method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The key to
AIGB-Pearl is to construct a non-bootstrapped \emph{trajectory evaluator} to
assign rewards and guide policy search, enabling the planner to optimize its
generation quality iteratively through interaction. Furthermore, to enhance
trajectory evaluator accuracy in offline settings, we incorporate three key
techniques: (i) a Large Language Model (LLM)-based architecture for better
representational capacity, (ii) hybrid point-wise and pair-wise losses for
better score learning, and (iii) adaptive integration of expert feedback for
better generalization ability. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of
our approach.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical
expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a
highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been
the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning
methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with
its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has
emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However,
its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often
limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for
symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key
innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying
globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under
polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping
actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to
promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape
the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and
efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these
improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression
methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box
datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto
frontier of accuracy versus model complexity. Code is available at

Conclusion: 对齐本质是接口工程：度量分配容量、管理任务复杂度、优化信息分配。

Abstract: Large language models improve with scale, yet feedback-based alignment still
exhibits systematic deviations from intended behavior. Motivated by bounded
rationality in economics and cognitive science, we view judgment as
resource-limited and feedback as a constrained channel. On this basis, we model
the loop as a two-stage cascade $U \to H \to Y$ given $S$, with cognitive
capacity $C_{\text{cog}|S}$ and average total capacity
$\bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. Our main result is a capacity-coupled Alignment
Performance Interval. It pairs a data size-independent Fano lower bound proved
on a separable codebook mixture with a PAC-Bayes upper bound whose KL term is
controlled by the same channel via $m \, \bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. The PAC-Bayes
bound becomes an upper bound on the same true risk when the canonical
observable loss is used and the dataset is drawn from the same mixture. Under
these matched conditions, both limits are governed by a single capacity.
Consequences include that, with value complexity and capacity fixed, adding
labels alone cannot cross the bound; attaining lower risk on more complex
targets requires capacity that grows with $\log M$; and once useful signal
saturates capacity, further optimization tends to fit channel regularities,
consistent with reports of sycophancy and reward hacking. The analysis views
alignment as interface engineering: measure and allocate limited capacity,
manage task complexity, and decide where information is spent.

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates physics and data into the
learning process, offering improved generalization compared with purely
data-driven models. Despite its potential, applications of SciML in prognostics
remain limited, partly due to the complexity of incorporating partial
differential equations (PDEs) for ageing physics and the scarcity of robust
uncertainty quantification methods. This work introduces a Bayesian
Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework for probabilistic
prognostics estimation. By embedding Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN
architecture, the proposed approach produces principled, uncertainty-aware
predictions. The method is applied to a transformer ageing case study, where
insulation degradation is primarily driven by thermal stress. The heat
diffusion PDE is used as the physical residual, and different prior
distributions are investigated to examine their impact on predictive posterior
distributions and their ability to encode a priori physical knowledge. The
framework is validated against a finite element model developed and tested with
real measurements from a solar power plant. Results, benchmarked against a
dropout-PINN baseline, show that the proposed B-PINN delivers more reliable
prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty. This
capability is crucial for supporting robust and informed maintenance
decision-making in critical power assets.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the in-hand pose of an object based on its CAD model
is crucial in both industrial applications and everyday tasks, ranging from
positioning workpieces and assembling components to seamlessly inserting
devices like USB connectors. While existing methods often rely on regression,
feature matching, or registration techniques, achieving high precision and
generalizability to unseen CAD models remains a significant challenge. In this
paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework for in-hand pose estimation.
The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates, followed by
iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage. In the final
stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates.
These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is
trained solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates
gradients to refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that
quantifies the quality of the pose estimates. Additionally, borrowing the idea
from the computer vision domain, we incorporate a render-compare architecture
within the energy-based score network to significantly enhance sim-to-real
performance, as demonstrated by our ablation studies. We conduct comprehensive
experiments to show that our method outperforms conventional baselines based on
regression, matching, and registration techniques, while also exhibiting strong
intra-category generalization to previously unseen CAD models. Moreover, our
approach integrates tactile object pose estimation, pose tracking, and
uncertainty estimation into a unified framework, enabling robust performance
across a variety of real-world conditions.

Conclusion: 影响函数既可作为可解释性工具，也可作为高效接收机自适应的基础方法。

Abstract: We present the first use of influence functions for deep learning-based
wireless receivers. Applied to DeepRx, a fully convolutional receiver,
influence analysis reveals which training samples drive bit predictions,
enabling targeted fine-tuning of poorly performing cases. We show that
loss-relative influence with capacity-like binary cross-entropy loss and
first-order updates on beneficial samples most consistently improves bit error
rate toward genie-aided performance, outperforming random fine-tuning in
single-target scenarios. Multi-target adaptation proved less effective,
underscoring open challenges. Beyond experiments, we connect influence to
self-influence corrections and propose a second-order, influence-aligned update
strategy. Our results establish influence functions as both an interpretability
tool and a basis for efficient receiver adaptation.

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明AGF-TI优于现有方法，算法具有理论收敛性。

Conclusion: AGF-TI有效缓解子簇问题，提升不完整多视图半监督学习性能，具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: View missing remains a significant challenge in graph-based multi-view
semi-supervised learning, hindering their real-world applications. To address
this issue, traditional methods introduce a missing indicator matrix and focus
on mining partial structure among existing samples in each view for label
propagation (LP). However, we argue that these disregarded missing samples
sometimes induce discontinuous local structures, i.e., sub-clusters, breaking
the fundamental smoothness assumption in LP. Consequently, such a Sub-Cluster
Problem (SCP) would distort graph fusion and degrade classification
performance. To alleviate SCP, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view
semi-supervised learning method, termed AGF-TI. Firstly, we design an
adversarial graph fusion scheme to learn a robust consensus graph against the
distorted local structure through a min-max framework. By stacking all
similarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure
from the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor
learning. Additionally, the anchor-based strategy is incorporated to reduce the
computational complexity. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm
combining a reduced gradient descent method is developed to solve the
formulated objective, with theoretical convergence. Extensive experimental
results on various datasets validate the superiority of our proposed AGF-TI as
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: RLinf 通过增强系统灵活性，有效突破强化学习训练效率瓶颈。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated immense potential in advancing
artificial general intelligence, agentic intelligence, and embodied
intelligence. However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL
workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing
systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system
based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training
lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is
built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow
transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level,
easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and
recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's
adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic
pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling
policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both
reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving 1.1x-2.13x speedup in
end-to-end training throughput.

Motivation: 现有模型难以在解码结构化输出时满足约束，且无法捕捉成本函数的多样性。

Result: 在船舶、出租车路径及合成图数据上验证了路径重建、分布预测及潜变量可解释性。

Conclusion: IO-LVM能有效建模多样成本函数，提升约束优化问题解的泛化与解释能力。

Abstract: Learning representations for solutions of constrained optimization problems
(COPs) with unknown cost functions is challenging, as models like (Variational)
Autoencoders struggle to enforce constraints when decoding structured outputs.
We propose an Inverse Optimization Latent Variable Model (IO-LVM) that learns a
latent space of COP cost functions from observed solutions and reconstructs
feasible outputs by solving a COP with a solver in the loop. Our approach
leverages estimated gradients of a Fenchel-Young loss through a
non-differentiable deterministic solver to shape the latent space. Unlike
standard Inverse Optimization or Inverse Reinforcement Learning methods, which
typically recover a single or context-specific cost function, IO-LVM captures a
distribution over cost functions, enabling the identification of diverse
solution behaviors arising from different agents or conditions not available
during the training process. We validate our method on real-world datasets of
ship and taxi routes, as well as paths in synthetic graphs, demonstrating its
ability to reconstruct paths and cycles, predict their distributions, and yield
interpretable latent representations.

Conclusion: 该系统在自动识别极端言论和动态追踪态度变化方面表现优异，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes an approach for automatically analysing and tracking
statements in material gathered online and detecting whether the authors of the
statements are likely to be involved in extremism or terrorism. The proposed
system comprises: online collation of statements that are then encoded in a
form amenable to machine learning (ML), an ML component to classify the encoded
text, a tracker, and a visualisation system for analysis of results. The
detection and tracking concept has been tested using quotes made by terrorists,
extremists, campaigners, and politicians, obtained from wikiquote.org. A set of
features was extracted for each quote using the state-of-the-art Universal
Sentence Encoder (Cer et al. 2018), which produces 512-dimensional vectors. The
data were used to train and test a support vector machine (SVM) classifier
using 10-fold cross-validation. The system was able to correctly detect
intentions and attitudes associated with extremism 81% of the time and
terrorism 97% of the time, using a dataset of 839 quotes. This accuracy was
higher than that which was achieved for a simple baseline system based on
n-gram text features. Tracking techniques were also used to perform a temporal
analysis of the data, with each quote considered to be a noisy measurement of a
person's state of mind. It was demonstrated that the tracking algorithms were
able to detect both trends over time and sharp changes in attitude that could
be attributed to major events.

Method: 扩展TSympNets架构以适应非自治哈密顿系统，并进行理论逼近性分析与数值实验验证。

Result: 证明TSympNets对可分离系统具有普适逼近能力，但无法推广至非可分离系统；同时修正了先前文献中的关键定理证明错误。

Conclusion: TSympNets为非等步长哈密顿系统学习提供有效框架，但其逼近能力受系统可分离性限制。

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly i.e. not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [20] and
H\'enonNets [4] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets, which we
call TSympNets, was introduced in [20]. We adapt the architecture of TSympNets
and extend them to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. So far the approximation
qualities of TSympNets were unknown. We close this gap by providing a universal
approximation theorem for separable Hamiltonian systems and show that it is not
possible to extend it to non-separable Hamiltonian systems. To investigate
these theoretical approximation capabilities, we perform different numerical
experiments. Furthermore we fix a mistake in a proof of a substantial theorem
[25, Theorem 2] for the approximation of symplectic maps in general, but
specifically for symplectic machine learning methods.

Conclusion: 本构模型发现不仅限于LASSO等ℓ₁方法，OMP等ℓ₀启发式方法同样有效可行。

Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged
as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In
this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model
discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression
(LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection
criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct
algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the
trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost.
While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the
$\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for
$\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and
anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental
datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform
consistently well for the discovery of isotropic and anisotropic materials,
yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range
of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric wind field information is crucial for various
applications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk
reduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains
challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote
sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of
numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast
three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward
Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear,
and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind
dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind
retrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with
skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios.
The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure
levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior
agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data.
Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for
localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations
(e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This
interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of
exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced
environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.

Abstract: Unsupervised multivariate time series (MTS) representation learning aims to
extract compact and informative representations from raw sequences without
relying on labels, enabling efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked
time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning.
DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked
values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations
of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve
representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that
encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's
outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally
coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations
across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our
approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive
baselines.

Abstract: A well-known pitfall of molecular generative models is that they are not
guaranteed to generate synthesizable molecules. There have been considerable
attempts to address this problem, but given the exponentially large
combinatorial space of synthesizable molecules, existing methods have shown
limited coverage of the space and poor molecular optimization performance. To
tackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for
synthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given
molecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in
synthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the
synthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic
pathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically,
inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the
chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction
types, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR
notation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly
learn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform
step-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning
capability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning
and goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable
projection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway
diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization
performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and
significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in
synthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability
to navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing (RS) is one of the prominent techniques to ensure the
correctness of machine learning models, where point-wise robustness
certificates can be derived analytically. While RS is well understood for
classification, its application to generative models is unclear, since their
outputs are sequences rather than labels. We resolve this by connecting
generative outputs to an oracle classification task and showing that RS can
still be enabled: the final response can be classified as a discrete action
(e.g., service-robot commands in VLAs), as harmful vs. harmless (content
moderation or toxicity detection in VLMs), or even applying oracles to cluster
answers into semantically equivalent ones. Provided that the error rate for the
oracle classifier comparison is bounded, we develop the theory that associates
the number of samples with the corresponding robustness radius. We further
derive improved scaling laws analytically relating the certified radius and
accuracy to the number of samples, showing that the earlier result of 2 to 3
orders of magnitude fewer samples sufficing with minimal loss remains valid
even under weaker assumptions. Together, these advances make robustness
certification both well-defined and computationally feasible for
state-of-the-art VLMs, as validated against recent jailbreak-style adversarial
attacks.

Abstract: We present a robust personalized federated learning framework that leverages
heat-kernel enhanced tensorized multi-view fuzzy c-means clustering with
advanced tensor decomposition techniques. Our approach integrates heat-kernel
coefficients adapted from quantum field theory with Tucker decomposition and
canonical polyadic decomposition (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) to transform conventional
distance metrics and efficiently represent high-dimensional multi-view
structures. The framework employs matriculation and vectorization techniques to
facilitate the discovery of hidden structures and multilinear relationships via
N-way generalized tensors. The proposed method introduces a dual-level
optimization scheme: local heat-kernel enhanced fuzzy clustering with tensor
decomposition operating on order-N input tensors, and federated aggregation of
tensor factors with privacy-preserving personalization mechanisms. The local
stage employs tensorized kernel Euclidean distance transformations and Tucker
decomposition to discover client-specific patterns in multi-view tensor data,
while the global aggregation process coordinates tensor factors (core tensors
and factor matrices) across clients through differential privacy-preserving
protocols. This tensorized approach enables efficient handling of
high-dimensional multi-view data with significant communication savings through
low-rank tensor approximations.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型强化学习方法存在求解器限制、前后过程不一致、CFG集成复杂等问题。

Method: DiffusionNFT通过对比正负样本生成，在前向过程中定义隐式策略改进方向，结合监督学习目标。

Result: 在1k步内将GenEval分数从0.24提升至0.98，优于FlowGRPO的5k步+CFG方案；在所有测试基准中显著提升SD3.5-Medium性能。

Conclusion: DiffusionNFT高效、灵活、无需CFG，是扩散模型强化学习的有效新范式。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language
models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to
intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process
to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks,
including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated
integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion
Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that
optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching.
DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit
policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals
into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with
arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and
requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy
optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in
head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT
improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO
achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging
multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of
SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自闭症缺乏可靠生物标志物，诊断延迟，亟需非侵入性精准检测工具。

Method: 基于ATR-FTIR光谱数据，结合PageRank与Degree特征，用遗传算法优化网络结构。

Result: 准确率0.78，敏感度0.61，特异度0.90，调和均值0.74，优于LDA、SVM及深度学习模型。

Conclusion: GANet为自闭症检测及光谱健康应用提供了一种稳健、仿生、非侵入性新方法。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) lacks reliable biological markers, delaying
early diagnosis. Using 159 salivary samples analyzed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy,
we developed GANet, a genetic algorithm-based network optimization framework
leveraging PageRank and Degree for importance-based feature characterization.
GANet systematically optimizes network structure to extract meaningful patterns
from high-dimensional spectral data. It achieved superior performance compared
to linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and deep learning
models, reaching 0.78 accuracy, 0.61 sensitivity, 0.90 specificity, and a 0.74
harmonic mean. These results demonstrate GANet's potential as a robust,
bio-inspired, non-invasive tool for precise ASD detection and broader
spectral-based health applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种动态分类器自由引导（CFG）调度框架，通过在线反馈优化每步的CFG尺度，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态CFG尺度无法适应不同提示的多样化需求，现有方法复杂且泛化性差。

Method: 利用CLIP、判别器和人类偏好模型等在线评估生成质量，贪心搜索每步最优CFG尺度。

Result: 在Imagen 3等模型上，文本对齐、视觉质量等指标显著提升，人类偏好胜率达55.5%。

Conclusion: 最优CFG调度应是动态且提示依赖的，本文框架高效且具泛化性。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion
models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales.
This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of
different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or
fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to
generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a
framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from
a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space
evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a
human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the
reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search
to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance
schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3,
showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text
rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default
Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate
for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts
targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that
the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and
provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出多场时空深度学习模型MSTM，可高效模拟冲击波在多孔及结构化材料中的传播，速度提升千倍且误差低于10%，适用于行星防御、聚变能源等领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以准确捕捉孔隙坍塌、异常冲击响应和局部加热等关键现象，制约了小行星偏转与聚变点火等应用。

Method: 构建统一七场变量的自回归深度学习模型，基于高保真流体代码数据训练。

Result: 在多孔材料中误差低于4%，晶格结构中低于10%，并能保持质量平均压力与温度误差在5%内。

Conclusion: MSTM将原本不可行的问题转化为可设计研究，为多尺度材料优化提供实用框架。

Abstract: The ability to predict how shock waves traverse porous and architected
materials is a decisive factor in planetary defense, national security, and the
race to achieve inertial fusion energy. Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous
Hugoniot responses, and localized heating -- phenomena that can determine the
success of asteroid deflection or fusion ignition -- has remained a major
challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations.
We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that
unifies seven coupled fields -- pressure, density, temperature, energy,
material distribution, and two velocity components -- into a single
autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM runs
about a thousand times faster than direct simulation, achieving errors below
4\% in porous materials and below 10\% in lattice structures. Unlike prior
single-field or operator-based surrogates, MSTM resolves sharp shock fronts
while preserving integrated quantities such as mass-averaged pressure and
temperature to within 5\%. This advance transforms problems once considered
intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework
for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation,
inertial fusion energy, and national security.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法因过度拟合特定网络拓扑而难以适应环境变化。

Method: 将网络防御建模为基于图的两玩家部分可观测马尔可夫决策问题，引入关系归纳偏置。

Result: 新方法在多种复杂多智能体环境中显著优于现有技术，能零样本适应未知网络。

Conclusion: 基于图结构的关系推理使智能体具备更强的网络状态理解与跨环境适应能力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable strategy for
automated cyber defense (ACD). The traditional RL approach represents networks
as a list of computers in various states of safety or threat. Unfortunately,
these models are forced to overfit to specific network topologies, rendering
them ineffective when faced with even small environmental perturbations. In
this work, we frame ACD as a two-player context-based partially observable
Markov decision problem with observations represented as attributed graphs.
This approach allows our agents to reason through the lens of relational
inductive bias. Agents learn how to reason about hosts interacting with other
system entities in a more general manner, and their actions are understood as
edits to the graph representing the environment. By introducing this bias, we
will show that our agents can better reason about the states of networks and
zero-shot adapt to new ones. We show that this approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by a wide margin, and makes our agents capable of defending
never-before-seen networks against a wide range of adversaries in a variety of
complex, and multi-agent environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出DiveBatch算法，通过动态调整批量大小加速深度学习模型训练，兼顾收敛速度与泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模深度模型训练计算开销大，传统学习率调优方法存在局限，需更高效训练策略。

Method: 基于梯度多样性动态调整批量大小，理论支撑来自SGD收敛分析，兼顾小批量泛化优势与大批量计算效率。

Result: 在CiFar-10/100和Tiny-ImageNet上，DiveBatch比标准SGD和AdaBatch快1.06至5倍，性能略有折衷。

Conclusion: DiveBatch有效提升训练效率，是兼顾速度与泛化的实用优化方法。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to accelerate the training of machine learning
models, a critical challenge since the training of large-scale deep neural
models can be computationally expensive. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and
its variants are widely used to train deep neural networks. In contrast to
traditional approaches that focus on tuning the learning rate, we propose a
novel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm, DiveBatch, that dynamically adjusts
the batch size. Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes
is more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often
converges in fewer epochs and generalizes better. To address this challenge, we
introduce a data-driven adaptation based on gradient diversity, enabling
DiveBatch to maintain the generalization performance of small-batch training
while improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Gradient
diversity has a strong theoretical justification: it emerges from the
convergence analysis of SGD. Evaluations of DiveBatch on synthetic and
CiFar-10, CiFar-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that DiveBatch converges
significantly faster than standard SGD and AdaBatch (1.06 -- 5.0x), with a
slight trade-off in performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对大语言模型的后门触发器检测与反演方法，通过离散搜索、隐式黑名单和高置信度误分类检测实现有效识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像AI后门检测方法难以直接应用于大语言模型，因其输入空间离散、搜索空间庞大且缺乏有效黑名单。

Method: 采用贪心离散搜索构建触发器，通过激活空间余弦相似度隐式黑名单过滤强关联词，并结合高置信度误分类进行检测。

Result: 该方法能可靠检测并成功反演真实后门触发短语，优于多数现有工作。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了大语言模型后门检测的关键挑战，具备实用性和高准确性。

Abstract: While effective backdoor detection and inversion schemes have been developed
for AIs used e.g. for images, there are challenges in "porting" these methods
to LLMs. First, the LLM input space is discrete, which precludes gradient-based
search over this space, central to many backdoor inversion methods. Second,
there are ~30,000^k k-tuples to consider, k the token-length of a putative
trigger. Third, for LLMs there is the need to blacklist tokens that have strong
marginal associations with the putative target response (class) of an attack,
as such tokens give false detection signals. However, good blacklists may not
exist for some domains. We propose a LLM trigger inversion approach with three
key components: i) discrete search, with putative triggers greedily accreted,
starting from a select list of singletons; ii) implicit blacklisting, achieved
by evaluating the average cosine similarity, in activation space, between a
candidate trigger and a small clean set of samples from the putative target
class; iii) detection when a candidate trigger elicits high misclassifications,
and with unusually high decision confidence. Unlike many recent works, we
demonstrate that our approach reliably detects and successfully inverts
ground-truth backdoor trigger phrases.

Conclusion: 该工具将一次性数据构建转为标准化、可配置、可复现的代理建模流程。

Abstract: We present ChannelFlow-Tools, a configuration-driven framework that
standardizes the end-to-end path from programmatic CAD solid generation to
ML-ready inputs and targets for 3D obstructed channel flows. The toolchain
integrates geometry synthesis with feasibility checks, signed distance field
(SDF) voxelization, automated solver orchestration on HPC (waLBerla LBM), and
Cartesian resampling to co-registered multi-resolution tensors. A single
Hydra/OmegaConf configuration governs all stages, enabling deterministic
reproduction and controlled ablations. As a case study, we generate 10k+ scenes
spanning Re=100-15000 with diverse shapes and poses. An end-to-end evaluation
of storage trade-offs directly from the emitted artifacts, a minimal 3D U-Net
at 128x32x32, and example surrogate models with dataset size illustrate that
the standardized representations support reproducible ML training.
ChannelFlow-Tools turns one-off dataset creation into a reproducible,

Result: 实验表明SynthBal显著提升重建精度、减少无效模型生成，并在高复杂度几何体上超越现有基准。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于推动逆向工程自动化，提升工程设计效率，相关数据与代码将公开发布。

Abstract: CAD programs, structured as parametric sequences of commands that compile
into precise 3D geometries, are fundamental to accurate and efficient
engineering design processes. Generating these programs from nonparametric data
such as point clouds and meshes remains a crucial yet challenging task,
typically requiring extensive manual intervention. Current deep generative
models aimed at automating CAD generation are significantly limited by
imbalanced and insufficiently large datasets, particularly those lacking
representation for complex CAD programs. To address this, we introduce
GenCAD-3D, a multimodal generative framework utilizing contrastive learning for
aligning latent embeddings between CAD and geometric encoders, combined with
latent diffusion models for CAD sequence generation and retrieval.
Additionally, we present SynthBal, a synthetic data augmentation strategy
specifically designed to balance and expand datasets, notably enhancing
representation of complex CAD geometries. Our experiments show that SynthBal
significantly boosts reconstruction accuracy, reduces the generation of invalid
CAD models, and markedly improves performance on high-complexity geometries,
surpassing existing benchmarks. These advancements hold substantial
implications for streamlining reverse engineering and enhancing automation in
engineering design. We will publicly release our datasets and code, including a
set of 51 3D-printed and laser-scanned parts on our project site.

Motivation: 现有方法难以建模物体间复杂逻辑与物理约束，导致场景不真实或不适应动态环境。

Method: 利用LLM构建因果图，结合PID控制器迭代优化物体布局，辅以3D高斯泼溅与分数蒸馏采样提升渲染质量。

Result: 实验表明CausalStruct生成的场景逻辑更连贯、空间交互更真实、适应性更强。

Conclusion: CausalStruct有效融合因果推理与物理建模，显著提升3D场景生成质量。

Abstract: Existing 3D scene generation methods often struggle to model the complex
logical dependencies and physical constraints between objects, limiting their
ability to adapt to dynamic and realistic environments. We propose
CausalStruct, a novel framework that embeds causal reasoning into 3D scene
generation. Utilizing large language models (LLMs), We construct causal graphs
where nodes represent objects and attributes, while edges encode causal
dependencies and physical constraints. CausalStruct iteratively refines the
scene layout by enforcing causal order to determine the placement order of
objects and applies causal intervention to adjust the spatial configuration
according to physics-driven constraints, ensuring consistency with textual
descriptions and real-world dynamics. The refined scene causal graph informs
subsequent optimization steps, employing a
Proportional-Integral-Derivative(PID) controller to iteratively tune object
scales and positions. Our method uses text or images to guide object placement
and layout in 3D scenes, with 3D Gaussian Splatting and Score Distillation
Sampling improving shape accuracy and rendering stability. Extensive
experiments show that CausalStruct generates 3D scenes with enhanced logical
coherence, realistic spatial interactions, and robust adaptability.

Result: 成功将MLP作为控制变量应用于光传输模拟，有效降低方差。

Conclusion: MLP结合所提方法可作为有效的控制变量，提升蒙特卡洛积分效率。

Abstract: Control variates are a variance-reduction technique for Monte Carlo
integration. The principle involves approximating the integrand by a function
that can be analytically integrated, and integrating using the Monte Carlo
method only the residual difference between the integrand and the
approximation, to obtain an unbiased estimate. Neural networks are universal
approximators that could potentially be used as a control variate. However, the
challenge lies in the analytic integration, which is not possible in general.
In this manuscript, we study one of the simplest neural network models, the
multilayered perceptron (MLP) with continuous piecewise linear activation
functions, and its possible analytic integration. We propose an integration
method based on integration domain subdivision, employing techniques from
computational geometry to solve this problem in 2D. We demonstrate that an MLP
can be used as a control variate in combination with our integration method,
showing applications in the light transport simulation.

Additionally, our framework integrates with finite element analysis, offering

results to guide material distributions. Practical case studies illustrate the
utility of these contributions, including functionally graded lattices,

Conclusion: 该方法可推广至有理贝塞尔曲线、曲面及导数计算，显著提升效率。

Abstract: It is well-known that a $d$-dimensional polynomial B\'{e}zier curve of degree
$n$ can be subdivided into two segments using the famous de Casteljau algorithm
in $O(dn^2)$ time. Can this problem be solved more efficiently? In this paper,
we show that it is possible to do this in $O(dn\log{n})$ time using the fast
Fourier transform and its inverse. Experiments show that the direct application
of the new method performs well only for small values of $n$, as the algorithm
is numerically unstable. However, a slightly modified version -- which still
has $O(dn\log{n})$ computational complexity -- offers good numerical quality,
which is confirmed by numerical experiments conducted in \textsf{Python}.
Moreover, the new method has a nice property: if a B\'{e}zier curve is extended
by an additional control point, the subdivision can be updated in $O(d)$ time.
  A similar idea can be applied to speed up the subdivision of rational
B\'{e}zier curves and rectangular B\'{e}zier surfaces, as well as to compute
the derivatives of B\'{e}zier curves more efficiently.

Result: 在ActorsHQ数据集上重建精度优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决动态场景高细节重建难题，兼具几何保真与拓扑适应能力。

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction from multi-view videos remains a fundamental
challenge in computer vision. While recent neural surface reconstruction
methods have achieved remarkable results in static 3D reconstruction, extending
these approaches with comparable quality for dynamic scenes introduces
significant computational and representational challenges. Existing dynamic
methods focus on novel-view synthesis, therefore, their extracted meshes tend
to be noisy. Even approaches aiming for geometric fidelity often result in too
smooth meshes due to the ill-posedness of the problem. We present a novel
framework for highly detailed dynamic reconstruction that extends the static 3D
reconstruction method NeuralAngelo to work in dynamic settings. To that end, we
start with a high-quality template scene reconstruction from the initial frame
using NeuralAngelo, and then jointly optimize deformation fields that track the
template and refine it based on the temporal sequence. This flexible template
allows updating the geometry to include changes that cannot be modeled with the
deformation field, for instance occluded parts or the changes in the topology.
We show superior reconstruction accuracy in comparison to previous
state-of-the-art methods on the ActorsHQ dataset.

Result: 显著优于现有混合输出或引导约束方法，首次实现稳健转换。

Conclusion: 该方法是首个能稳健将关键帧动画转换为细致自然动画的扩散模型方案。

Abstract: We focus on the problem of using generative diffusion models for the task of
motion detailing: converting a rough version of a character animation,
represented by a sparse set of coarsely posed, and imprecisely timed blocking
poses, into a detailed, natural looking character animation. Current diffusion
models can address the problem of correcting the timing of imprecisely timed
poses, but we find that no good solution exists for leveraging the diffusion
prior to enhance a sparse set of blocking poses with additional pose detail. We
overcome this challenge using a simple inference-time trick. At certain
diffusion steps, we blend the outputs of an unconditioned diffusion model with
input blocking pose constraints using per-blocking-pose tolerance weights, and
pass this result in as the input condition to an pre-existing motion retiming
model. We find this approach works significantly better than existing
approaches that attempt to add detail by blending model outputs or via
expressing blocking pose constraints as guidance. The result is the first
diffusion model that can robustly convert blocking-level poses into plausible
detailed character animations.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR), a
significant gap remains between research and practical deployment. Many studies
assess MLIR performance in isolated settings, limiting their applicability to
real-world scenarios. In this work, we leverage the unique characteristics of
the Quranic multilingual corpus to examine the optimal strategies to develop an
ad-hoc IR system for the Islamic domain that is designed to satisfy users'
information needs in multiple languages. We prepared eleven retrieval models
employing four training approaches: monolingual, cross-lingual,
translate-train-all, and a novel mixed method combining cross-lingual and
monolingual techniques. Evaluation on an in-domain dataset demonstrates that
the mixed approach achieves promising results across diverse retrieval
scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of how different
training configurations affect the embedding space and their implications for
multilingual retrieval effectiveness. Finally, we discuss deployment
considerations, emphasizing the cost-efficiency of deploying a single
versatile, lightweight model for real-world MLIR applications.

Conclusion: 该方法将模态对齐任务交由预训练模型，建立强零样本基线，适合作为未来VDR系统的参考。

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) typically operates as text-to-image retrieval
using specialized bi-encoders trained to directly embed document images. We
revisit a zero-shot generate-and-encode pipeline: a vision-language model first
produces a detailed textual description of each document image, which is then
embedded by a standard text encoder. On the ViDoRe-v2 benchmark, the method
reaches 63.4% nDCG@5, surpassing the strongest specialised multi-vector visual
document encoder. It also scales better to large collections and offers broader
multilingual coverage. Analysis shows that modern vision-language models
capture complex textual and visual cues with sufficient granularity to act as a
reusable semantic proxy. By offloading modality alignment to pretrained
vision-language models, our approach removes the need for computationally
intensive text-image contrastive training and establishes a strong zero-shot
baseline for future VDR systems.

Abstract: In brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, steady-state visual evoked
potentials (SSVEP) and P300 responses have achieved widespread implementation
owing to their superior information transfer rates (ITR) and minimal training
requirements. These neurophysiological signals have exhibited robust efficacy
and versatility in external device control, demonstrating enhanced precision
and scalability. However, conventional implementations predominantly utilise
liquid crystal display (LCD)-based visual stimulation paradigms, which present
limitations in practical deployment scenarios. This investigation presents the
development and evaluation of a novel light-emitting diode (LED)-based dual
stimulation apparatus designed to enhance SSVEP classification accuracy through
the integration of both SSVEP and P300 paradigms. The system employs four
distinct frequencies, 7 Hz, 8 Hz, 9 Hz, and 10 Hz, corresponding to forward,
backward, right, and left directional controls, respectively. Oscilloscopic
verification confirmed the precision of these stimulation frequencies.
Real-time feature extraction was accomplished through the concurrent analysis
of maximum Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) amplitude and P300 peak detection to
ascertain user intent. Directional control was determined by the frequency
exhibiting maximal amplitude characteristics. The visual stimulation hardware
demonstrated minimal frequency deviation, with error differentials ranging from
0.15%to 0.20%across all frequencies. The implemented signal processing
algorithm successfully discriminated all four stimulus frequencies whilst
correlating them with their respective P300 event markers. Classification
accuracy was evaluated based on correct task intention recognition. The
proposed hybrid system achieved a mean classification accuracy of 86.25%,
coupled with an average ITR of 42.08 bits per minute (bpm).

Conclusion: 检索融合有效增强系统稳定性，但需在效率与效果间取舍。

Abstract: The 2025 TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT) featured both
interactive and offline submission tasks. The former requires systems to
operate under real-time constraints, making robustness and efficiency as
important as accuracy, while the latter enables controlled evaluation of
passage ranking and response generation with pre-defined datasets. To address
this, we explored query rewriting and retrieval fusion as core strategies. We
built our pipelines around Best-of-$N$ selection and Reciprocal Rank Fusion
(RRF) strategies to handle different submission tasks. Results show that
reranking and fusion improve robustness while revealing trade-offs between
effectiveness and efficiency across both tasks.

Abstract: Traditional query expansion techniques for addressing vocabulary mismatch
problems in information retrieval are context-sensitive and may lead to
performance degradation. As an alternative, document expansion research has
gained attention, but existing methods such as Doc2Query have limitations
including excessive preprocessing costs, increased index size, and reliability
issues with generated content. To mitigate these problems and seek more
structured and efficient alternatives, this study proposes a method that
divides documents into chunk units and generates textual data for each chunk to
simultaneously improve retrieval efficiency and accuracy. The proposed "Chunk
Knowledge Generation Model" adopts a T5-based multi-task learning structure
that simultaneously generates titles and candidate questions from each document
chunk while extracting keywords from user queries. This approach maximizes
computational efficiency by generating and extracting three types of semantic
information in parallel through a single encoding and two decoding processes.
The generated data is utilized as additional information in the retrieval
system. GPT-based evaluation on 305 query-document pairs showed that retrieval
using the proposed model achieved 95.41% accuracy at Top@10, demonstrating
superior performance compared to document chunk-level retrieval. This study
contributes by proposing an approach that simultaneously generates titles and
candidate questions from document chunks for application in retrieval
pipelines, and provides empirical evidence applicable to large-scale
information retrieval systems by demonstrating improved retrieval accuracy
through qualitative evaluation.

Conclusion: 揭示了协同过滤模型扩展时的新现象，理解双峰成因，并理论分析其噪声鲁棒性，与实验结果一致。

Abstract: Scaling recommendation models into large recommendation models has become one
of the most widely discussed topics. Recent efforts focus on components beyond
the scaling embedding dimension, as it is believed that scaling embedding may
lead to performance degradation. Although there have been some initial
observations on embedding, the root cause of their non-scalability remains
unclear. Moreover, whether performance degradation occurs across different
types of models and datasets is still an unexplored area. Regarding the effect
of embedding dimensions on performance, we conduct large-scale experiments
across 10 datasets with varying sparsity levels and scales, using 4
representative classical architectures. We surprisingly observe two novel
phenomenon: double-peak and logarithmic. For the former, as the embedding
dimension increases, performance first improves, then declines, rises again,
and eventually drops. For the latter, it exhibits a perfect logarithmic curve.
Our contributions are threefold. First, we discover two novel phenomena when
scaling collaborative filtering models. Second, we gain an understanding of the
underlying causes of the double-peak phenomenon. Lastly, we theoretically
analyze the noise robustness of collaborative filtering models, with results
matching empirical observations.

Motivation: 传统关键词搜索方法无法有效识别语义相似的商品标题，导致平台信任度下降和运营成本增加。

Method: 采用基于BERT的文本模型与图像MaskedAutoEncoders，结合降维技术生成128维嵌入，并构建融合图文特征的决策模型，配合Milvus向量数据库实现高效检索。

Result: 在超2亿商品数据集上，系统仅用100GB内存实现F1值0.90，优于第三方方案的0.83。

Conclusion: 领域适配结合前沿机器学习技术能有效解决大规模电商环境中的商品重复问题。

Abstract: In large scale e-commerce marketplaces, duplicate product listings frequently
cause consumer confusion and operational inefficiencies, degrading trust on the
platform and increasing costs. Traditional keyword-based search methodologies
falter in accurately identifying duplicates due to their reliance on exact
textual matches, neglecting semantic similarities inherent in product titles.
To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable, multimodal product
deduplication designed specifically for the e-commerce domain. Our approach
employs a domain-specific text model grounded in BERT architecture in
conjunction with MaskedAutoEncoders for image representations. Both of these
architectures are augmented with dimensionality reduction techniques to produce
compact 128-dimensional embeddings without significant information loss.
Complementing this, we also developed a novel decider model that leverages both
text and image vectors. By integrating these feature extraction mechanisms with
Milvus, an optimized vector database, our system can facilitate efficient and
high-precision similarity searches across extensive product catalogs exceeding
200 million items with just 100GB of system RAM consumption. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that our matching system achieves a macro-average F1
score of 0.90, outperforming third-party solutions which attain an F1 score of
0.83. Our findings show the potential of combining domain-specific adaptations
with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to mitigate duplicate
listings in large-scale e-commerce environments.

In this work, we present MICA (Multi-Agent Industrial Coordination Assistant),
a perception-grounded and speech-interactive system that delivers real-time
guidance for assembly, troubleshooting, part queries, and maintenance. MICA
coordinates five role-specialized language agents, audited by a safety checker,

Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) is a growing field that aims to embed
algorithmic logic into neural networks by imitating classical algorithms. In
this extended abstract, we detail our attempt to build a neural algorithmic
reasoner that can solve Knapsack, a pseudo-polynomial problem bridging
classical algorithms and combinatorial optimisation, but omitted in standard
NAR benchmarks. Our neural algorithmic reasoner is designed to closely follow
the two-phase pipeline for the Knapsack problem, which involves first
constructing the dynamic programming table and then reconstructing the solution
from it. The approach, which models intermediate states through dynamic
programming supervision, achieves better generalization to larger problem
instances than a direct-prediction baseline that attempts to select the optimal
subset only from the problem inputs.

Conclusion: 元强化学习方案在交通信号控制中仍存在稳健性和可靠性问题。

Abstract: The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart
transportation networks has increased significantly in the last few years.
Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to
be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using
Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the
trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input
data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This
presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of
AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if
a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address
this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement
Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we
evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and
show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to
reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well
(with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not
robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.

semantic closeness to the input. Three embedding models were evaluated. A
statistical thresholding approach is then applied to filter relevant papers,
enabling an effective literature review pipeline. Despite the absence of

promise as a scalable and practical tool for preliminary research and

Abstract: The utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analytical tasks is rooted in
their vast pre-trained knowledge, which allows them to interpret ambiguous
inputs and infer missing information. However, this same capability introduces
a critical risk of what we term knowledge-driven hallucination: a phenomenon
where the model's output contradicts explicit source evidence because it is
overridden by the model's generalized internal knowledge. This paper
investigates this phenomenon by evaluating LLMs on the task of automated
process modeling, where the goal is to generate a formal business process model
from a given source artifact. The domain of Business Process Management (BPM)
provides an ideal context for this study, as many core business processes
follow standardized patterns, making it likely that LLMs possess strong
pre-trained schemas for them. We conduct a controlled experiment designed to
create scenarios with deliberate conflict between provided evidence and the
LLM's background knowledge. We use inputs describing both standard and
deliberately atypical process structures to measure the LLM's fidelity to the
provided evidence. Our work provides a methodology for assessing this critical
reliability issue and raises awareness of the need for rigorous validation of
AI-generated artifacts in any evidence-based domain.

Conclusion: 为工具增强型LLM智能体建立标准化、可复现的专家行为迁移与主动优化基础。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of neural architectures - from multilayer perceptrons to
large-scale Transformer-based models - has enabled language models (LLMs) to
exhibit emergent agentic behaviours when equipped with memory, planning, and
external tool use. However, their inherent stochasticity and multi-step
decision processes render classical evaluation methods inadequate for
diagnosing agentic performance. This work introduces a diagnostic framework for
expert systems that not only evaluates but also facilitates the transfer of
expert behaviour into LLM-powered agents. The framework integrates (i) curated
golden datasets of expert annotations, (ii) silver datasets generated through
controlled behavioural mutation, and (iii) an LLM-based Agent Judge that scores
and prescribes targeted improvements. These prescriptions are embedded into a
vectorized recommendation map, allowing expert interventions to propagate as
reusable improvement trajectories across multiple system instances. We
demonstrate the framework on a multi-agent recruiter-assistant system, showing
that it uncovers latent cognitive failures - such as biased phrasing,
extraction drift, and tool misrouting - while simultaneously steering agents
toward expert-level reasoning and style. The results establish a foundation for
standardized, reproducible expert behaviour transfer in stochastic,
tool-augmented LLM agents, moving beyond static evaluation to active expert
system refinement.

Conclusion: FragmentRetro虽不生成完整反应路径，但其高效性与优质候选起点生成能力，使其成为可扩展自动化合成规划的重要基础组件。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of deconstructing a target molecule into simpler
precursors, is crucial for computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP). Widely
adopted tree-search methods often suffer from exponential computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce FragmentRetro, a novel retrosynthetic
method that leverages fragmentation algorithms, specifically BRICS and r-BRICS,
combined with stock-aware exploration and pattern fingerprint screening to
achieve quadratic complexity. FragmentRetro recursively combines molecular
fragments and verifies their presence in a building block set, providing sets
of fragment combinations as retrosynthetic solutions. We present the first
formal computational analysis of retrosynthetic methods, showing that tree
search exhibits exponential complexity $O(b^h)$, DirectMultiStep scales as
$O(h^6)$, and FragmentRetro achieves $O(h^2)$, where $h$ represents the number
of heavy atoms in the target molecule and $b$ is the branching factor for tree
search. Evaluations on PaRoutes, USPTO-190, and natural products demonstrate
that FragmentRetro achieves high solved rates with competitive runtime,
including cases where tree search fails. The method benefits from fingerprint
screening, which significantly reduces substructure matching complexity. While
FragmentRetro focuses on efficiently identifying fragment-based solutions
rather than full reaction pathways, its computational advantages and ability to
generate strategic starting candidates establish it as a powerful foundational
component for scalable and automated synthesis planning.

Abstract: Highly capable AI systems could secretly pursue misaligned goals -- what we
call "scheming". Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its
misaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires
different strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing
anti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme
on far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming
is driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to
pre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of "covert actions" --
such as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as
a proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then
stress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26
OOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert
action rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our
mitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal
previously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after
additional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often
demonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal
evidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness
increases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in
covert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.
While we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational
awareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to
rely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard
English. We encourage research into alignment mitigations for scheming and
their assessment, especially for the adversarial case of deceptive alignment,
which this paper does not address.

Abstract: This paper presents MicroRCA-Agent, an innovative solution for microservice
root cause analysis based on large language model agents, which constructs an
intelligent fault root cause localization system with multimodal data fusion.
The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine
the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering
mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault
features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates
Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation
to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a
statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM
analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across
node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module
leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal
anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical
reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis
results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning
trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each
modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed
solution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault
scenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71. The code has been released at:

Abstract: The automated repair of C++ compilation errors presents a significant
challenge, the resolution of which is critical for developer productivity.
Progress in this domain is constrained by two primary factors: the scarcity of
large-scale, high-fidelity datasets and the limitations of conventional
supervised methods, which often fail to generate semantically correct
patches.This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a comprehensive
framework with three core contributions. First, we present CCrepair, a novel,
large-scale C++ compilation error dataset constructed through a sophisticated
generate-and-verify pipeline. Second, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)
paradigm guided by a hybrid reward signal, shifting the focus from mere
compilability to the semantic quality of the fix. Finally, we establish the
robust, two-stage evaluation system providing this signal, centered on an
LLM-as-a-Judge whose reliability has been rigorously validated against the
collective judgments of a panel of human experts. This integrated approach
aligns the training objective with generating high-quality, non-trivial patches
that are both syntactically and semantically correct. The effectiveness of our
approach was demonstrated experimentally. Our RL-trained Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
model achieved performance comparable to a Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model,
validating the efficiency of our training paradigm. Our work provides the
research community with a valuable new dataset and a more effective paradigm
for training and evaluating robust compilation repair models, paving the way

Result: 建立了涵盖架构、能力、数据、智能水平等维度的智能RPA分类体系。

Conclusion: 智能RPA通过机器学习增强，可显著拓展自动化任务边界。

Abstract: Robotic process automation (RPA) is a lightweight approach to automating
business processes using software robots that emulate user actions at the
graphical user interface level. While RPA has gained popularity for its
cost-effective and timely automation of rule-based, well-structured tasks, its
symbolic nature has inherent limitations when approaching more complex tasks
currently performed by human agents. Machine learning concepts enabling
intelligent RPA provide an opportunity to broaden the range of automatable
tasks. In this paper, we conduct a literature review to explore the connections
between RPA and machine learning and organize the joint concept intelligent RPA
into a taxonomy. Our taxonomy comprises the two meta-characteristics RPA-ML
integration and RPA-ML interaction. Together, they comprise eight dimensions:
architecture and ecosystem, capabilities, data basis, intelligence level, and
technical depth of integration as well as deployment environment, lifecycle
phase, and user-robot relation.

TL;DR: CLIMB框架通过语义聚类与多智能体系统，自动化构建高质量职业分类体系，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有职业分类方法难以兼顾动态区域市场适应性与数据噪声下的层次一致性。

Method: 采用全局语义聚类提取核心职业，结合反思型多智能体系统迭代构建层次结构。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CLIMB生成的分类体系更连贯、可扩展，并能捕捉区域特征。

Conclusion: CLIMB为自动化构建职业分类提供高效、高质量解决方案，代码与数据已开源。

Abstract: Creating robust occupation taxonomies, vital for applications ranging from
job recommendation to labor market intelligence, is challenging. Manual
curation is slow, while existing automated methods are either not adaptive to
dynamic regional markets (top-down) or struggle to build coherent hierarchies
from noisy data (bottom-up). We introduce CLIMB (CLusterIng-based Multi-agent
taxonomy Builder), a framework that fully automates the creation of
high-quality, data-driven taxonomies from raw job postings. CLIMB uses global
semantic clustering to distill core occupations, then employs a
reflection-based multi-agent system to iteratively build a coherent hierarchy.
On three diverse, real-world datasets, we show that CLIMB produces taxonomies
that are more coherent and scalable than existing methods and successfully
capture unique regional characteristics. We release our code and datasets at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLIMB.

Abstract: We are developing infrastructure to support researchers in mapping data
related to the peripheral nervous system and other physiological systems, with
an emphasis on their relevance to the organs under investigation. The nervous
system, a complex network of nerves and ganglia, plays a critical role in
coordinating and transmitting signals throughout the body. To aid in this, we
have created ApiNATOMY, a framework for the topological and semantic
representation of multiscale physiological circuit maps. ApiNATOMY integrates a
Knowledge Representation (KR) model and a suite of Knowledge Management (KM)
tools. The KR model enables physiology experts to easily capture interactions
between anatomical entities, while the KM tools help modelers convert
high-level abstractions into detailed models of physiological processes, which
can be integrated with external ontologies and knowledge graphs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过EHR-MCP框架验证LLM在真实医院环境中通过MCP协议从电子病历系统自主检索临床数据的可行性，结果显示在简单任务中表现近乎完美，复杂任务仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型因无法接入电子病历系统而难以在医院部署的问题，探索其临床应用潜力。

Method: 构建EHR-MCP框架，结合GPT-4.1与LangGraph ReAct代理，通过六个感染控制团队用例任务评估其在八名患者数据上的表现。

Result: LLM能正确选择并执行工具，除两项复杂任务外其余任务准确率接近完美；错误多源于参数错误或结果误读，数据冗长可能超出上下文限制。

Conclusion: LLM可通过MCP安全访问EHR数据，为医院AI代理提供基础架构，未来需拓展至推理、生成与临床影响评估。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in medicine, but their
deployment in hospitals is limited by restricted access to electronic health
record (EHR) systems. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration
between LLMs and external tools.
  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP
can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital
setting.
  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated
with the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct
agent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the
infection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were
retrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was
measured.
  Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools.
Except for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was
lower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors
arose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses
from EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding
the context window.
  Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a
real hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while
highlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for
secure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI
agents. Future work should extend beyond retrieval to reasoning, generation,
and clinical impact assessment, paving the way for effective integration of
generative AI into clinical practice.

Abstract: Industrial monitoring systems, especially when deployed in Industry 4.0
environments, are experiencing a shift in paradigm from traditional rule-based
architectures to data-driven approaches leveraging machine learning and
artificial intelligence. This study presents a comparison between these two
methodologies, analyzing their respective strengths, limitations, and
application scenarios, and proposes a basic framework to evaluate their key
properties. Rule-based systems offer high interpretability, deterministic
behavior, and ease of implementation in stable environments, making them ideal
for regulated industries and safety-critical applications. However, they face
challenges with scalability, adaptability, and performance in complex or
evolving contexts. Conversely, data-driven systems excel in detecting hidden
anomalies, enabling predictive maintenance and dynamic adaptation to new
conditions. Despite their high accuracy, these models face challenges related
to data availability, explainability, and integration complexity. The paper
suggests hybrid solutions as a possible promising direction, combining the
transparency of rule-based logic with the analytical power of machine learning.
Our hypothesis is that the future of industrial monitoring lies in intelligent,
synergic systems that leverage both expert knowledge and data-driven insights.
This dual approach enhances resilience, operational efficiency, and trust,
paving the way for smarter and more flexible industrial environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为改进T2I空间关系提供实用且可移植的解决方案

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has advanced rapidly, yet faithfully capturing
spatial relationships described in natural language prompts remains a major
challenge. Prior efforts have addressed this issue through prompt optimization,
spatially grounded generation, and semantic refinement. This work introduces a
lightweight approach that augments prompts with tuple-based structured
information, using a fine-tuned language model for automatic conversion and
seamless integration into T2I pipelines. Experimental results demonstrate
substantial improvements in spatial accuracy, without compromising overall
image quality as measured by Inception Score. Furthermore, the automatically
generated tuples exhibit quality comparable to human-crafted tuples. This
structured information provides a practical and portable solution to enhance
spatial relationships in T2I generation, addressing a key limitation of current
large-scale generative systems.

Conclusion: ASAC有效连接认知科学与机器学习，为AI系统高效利用注意力机制提供新路径。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become integral in AI, significantly enhancing
model performance and scalability by drawing inspiration from human cognition.
Concurrently, the Attention Schema Theory (AST) in cognitive science posits
that individuals manage their attention by creating a model of the attention
itself, effectively allocating cognitive resources. Inspired by AST, we
introduce ASAC (Attention Schema-based Attention Control), which integrates the
attention schema concept into artificial neural networks. Our initial
experiments focused on embedding the ASAC module within transformer
architectures. This module employs a Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder
(VQVAE) as both an attention abstractor and controller, facilitating precise
attention management. By explicitly modeling attention allocation, our approach
aims to enhance system efficiency. We demonstrate ASAC's effectiveness in both
the vision and NLP domains, highlighting its ability to improve classification
accuracy and expedite the learning process. Our experiments with vision
transformers across various datasets illustrate that the attention controller
not only boosts classification accuracy but also accelerates learning.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated the model's robustness and generalization
capabilities across noisy and out-of-distribution datasets. In addition, we
have showcased improved performance in multi-task settings. Quick experiments
reveal that the attention schema-based module enhances resilience to
adversarial attacks, optimizes attention to improve learning efficiency, and
facilitates effective transfer learning and learning from fewer examples. These
promising results establish a connection between cognitive science and machine
learning, shedding light on the efficient utilization of attention mechanisms
in AI systems.

Motivation: 解决飞行物体落点预测缺乏多样化公开数据集及早期轨迹相似导致预测困难的问题。

Method: 构建包含20种物体的8000条轨迹数据集，提出DIPP方法，包含DFE特征嵌入模块与IPP落点预测模块（含NAE与DPE两种实现）。

Result: 在15种已见与5种未见物体上优于基线方法，仿真与实物实验均验证早期预测提升接物成功率。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效应对复杂空气动力学下的飞行物体捕捉，数据集与模型均具实用价值。

Abstract: In this study, we address the problem of in-flight object catching using a
quadruped robot with a basket. Our objective is to accurately predict the
impact point, defined as the object's landing position. This task poses two key
challenges: the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under
unsteady aerodynamics, which are essential for training reliable predictors;
and the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when
trajectories appear similar across objects. To overcome these issues, we
construct a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects, providing
a foundation for advancing in-flight object catching under complex
aerodynamics. We then propose the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP),
consisting of two modules: (i) a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) that
separates trajectories by dynamics to enable early-stage discrimination and
generalization, and (ii) an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) that estimates the
impact point from these features. Two IPP variants are implemented: an Neural
Acceleration Estimator (NAE)-based method that predicts trajectories and
derives the impact point, and a Direct Point Estimator (DPE)-based method that
directly outputs it. Experimental results show that our dataset is more diverse
and complex than existing dataset, and that our method outperforms baselines on
both 15 seen and 5 unseen objects. Furthermore, we show that improved
early-stage prediction enhances catching success in simulation and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through real-world experiments. The

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development and testing of GiAnt, an
affordable hexapod which is inspired by the efficient motions of ants. The
decision to model GiAnt after ants rather than other insects is rooted in ants'
natural adaptability to a variety of terrains. This bio-inspired approach gives
it a significant advantage in outdoor applications, offering terrain
flexibility along with efficient energy use. It features a lightweight
3D-printed and laser cut structure weighing 1.75 kg with dimensions of 310 mm x
200 mm x 120 mm. Its legs have been designed with a simple Single Degree of
Freedom (DOF) using a link and crank mechanism. It is great for conquering
challenging terrains such as grass, rocks, and steep surfaces. Unlike
traditional robots using four wheels for motion, its legged design gives
superior adaptability to uneven and rough surfaces. GiAnt's control system is
built on Arduino, allowing manual operation. An effective way of controlling
the legs of GiAnt was achieved by gait analysis. It can move up to 8 cm of
height easily with its advanced leg positioning system. Furthermore, equipped
with machine learning and image processing technology, it can identify 81
different objects in a live monitoring system. It represents a significant step
towards creating accessible hexapod robots for research, exploration, and
surveying, offering unique advantages in adaptability and control simplicity.

capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2)
absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering

infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across
three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced

data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied
Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task
Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view),
providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially,
we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the
leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins

Conclusion: 结合实测力的势场模型显著提升远程超声力反馈透明度与精度。

Abstract: Teleoperated ultrasound can improve diagnostic medical imaging access for
remote communities. Having accurate force feedback is important for enabling
sonographers to apply the appropriate probe contact force to optimize
ultrasound image quality. However, large time delays in communication make
direct force feedback impractical. Prior work investigated using point
cloud-based model-mediated teleoperation and internal potential field models to
estimate contact forces and torques. We expand on this by introducing a method
to update the internal potential field model of the patient with measured
positions and forces for more transparent model-mediated tele-ultrasound. We
first generate a point cloud model of the patient's surface and transmit this
to the sonographer in a compact data structure. This is converted to a static
voxelized volume where each voxel contains a potential field value. These
values determine the forces and torques, which are rendered based on overlap
between the voxelized volume and a point shell model of the ultrasound
transducer. We solve for the potential field using a convex quadratic that
combines the spatial Laplace operator with measured forces. This was evaluated
on volunteer patients ($n=3$) by computing the accuracy of rendered forces.
Results showed the addition of measured forces to the model reduced the force
magnitude error by an average of 7.23 N and force vector angle error by an
average of 9.37$^{\circ}$ compared to using only Laplace's equation.

Conclusion: 提供透明非策略性影响框架，增强人机交互安全性与效率。

Abstract: Safe and efficient interaction between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and
human-driven vehicles (HVs) is a critical challenge for future transportation
systems. While game-theoretic models capture how AVs influence HVs, they often
suffer from a long-term decay of influence and can be perceived as
manipulative, eroding the human's trust. This can paradoxically lead to riskier
human driving behavior over repeated interactions. In this paper, we address
this challenge by proposing the Trust-Aware Embodied Bayesian Persuasion
(TA-EBP) framework. Our work makes three key contributions: First, we apply
Bayesian persuasion to model communication at traffic intersections, offering a
transparent alternative to traditional game-theoretic models. Second, we
introduce a trust parameter to the persuasion framework, deriving a theorem for
the minimum trust level required for influence. Finally, we ground the abstract
signals of Bayesian persuasion theory into a continuous, physically meaningful
action space, deriving a second theorem for the optimal signal magnitude,
realized as an AV's forward nudge. Additionally, we validate our framework in a
mixed-autonomy traffic simulation, demonstrating that TA-EBP successfully
persuades HVs to drive more cautiously, eliminating collisions and improving
traffic flow compared to baselines that either ignore trust or lack
communication. Our work provides a transparent and non-strategic framework for
influence in human-robot interaction, enhancing both safety and efficiency.

Abstract: We present Sym2Real, a fully data-driven framework that provides a principled
way to train low-level adaptive controllers in a highly data-efficient manner.
Using only about 10 trajectories, we achieve robust control of both a quadrotor
and a racecar in the real world, without expert knowledge or simulation tuning.
Our approach achieves this data efficiency by bringing symbolic regression to
real-world robotics while addressing key challenges that prevent its direct
application, including noise sensitivity and model degradation that lead to
unsafe control. Our key observation is that the underlying physics is often
shared for a system regardless of internal or external changes. Hence, we
strategically combine low-fidelity simulation data with targeted real-world
residual learning. Through experimental validation on quadrotor and racecar
platforms, we demonstrate consistent data-efficient adaptation across six
out-of-distribution sim2sim scenarios and successful sim2real transfer across
five real-world conditions. More information and videos can be found at at

Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is essential
for vehicle safety, stability, and performance, especially in autonomous
racing, where vehicles often operate at the friction limit. However, TRFC
cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation
methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or
require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight
approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies
solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special
dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip
events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions,
and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under
no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across
different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results
closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the
potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for
real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Human-to-humanoid imitation learning aims to learn a humanoid whole-body
controller from human motion. Motion retargeting is a crucial step in enabling
robots to acquire reference trajectories when exploring locomotion skills.
However, current methods focus on motion retargeting frame by frame, which
lacks scalability. Could we directly convert large-scale human motion into
robot-executable motion through a more efficient approach? To address this
issue, we propose Implicit Kinodynamic Motion Retargeting (IKMR), a novel
efficient and scalable retargeting framework that considers both kinematics and
dynamics. In kinematics, IKMR pretrains motion topology feature representation
and a dual encoder-decoder architecture to learn a motion domain mapping. In
dynamics, IKMR integrates imitation learning with the motion retargeting
network to refine motion into physically feasible trajectories. After
fine-tuning using the tracking results, IKMR can achieve large-scale physically
feasible motion retargeting in real time, and a whole-body controller could be
directly trained and deployed for tracking its retargeted trajectories. We
conduct our experiments both in the simulator and the real robot on a full-size
humanoid robot. Extensive experiments and evaluation results verify the

TL;DR: 提出一种可解释AI增强的多智能体机器人监督控制框架，结合时间自动机、鲁棒连续控制与可解释预测器，在航天器与AUV场景中验证其高效性与可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升多智能体机器人系统在安全关键与资源受限环境下的控制性能与决策可解释性。

Method: 融合时间自动机监督器、李雅普诺夫与滑模控制器、可解释预测器，并以蒙特卡洛优化生成训练数据。

Result: 在航天器任务中，SMC相比PD控制器降低21.7%跟踪误差与81.4%能耗；在AUV中维持有界误差，展现方法的可移植性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架在不同动力学环境下均具高效性与可解释性，适用于安全关键的多智能体机器人系统。

Abstract: We present an explainable AI-enhanced supervisory control framework for
multi-agent robotics that combines (i) a timed-automata supervisor for safe,
auditable mode switching, (ii) robust continuous control (Lyapunov-based
controller for large-angle maneuver; sliding-mode controller (SMC) with
boundary layers for precision and disturbance rejection), and (iii) an
explainable predictor that maps mission context to gains and expected
performance (energy, error). Monte Carlo-driven optimization provides the
training data, enabling transparent real-time trade-offs.
  We validated the approach in two contrasting domains, spacecraft formation
flying and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite different
environments (gravity/actuator bias vs. hydrodynamic drag/currents), both share
uncertain six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) rigid-body dynamics, relative motion,
and tight tracking needs, making them representative of general robotic
systems. In the space mission, the supervisory logic selects parameters that
meet mission criteria. In AUV leader-follower tests, the same SMC structure
maintains a fixed offset under stochastic currents with bounded steady error.
In spacecraft validation, the SMC controller achieved submillimeter alignment
with 21.7% lower tracking error and 81.4% lower energy consumption compared to
Proportional-Derivative PD controller baselines. At the same time, in AUV
tests, SMC maintained bounded errors under stochastic currents. These results
highlight both the portability and the interpretability of the approach for
safety-critical, resource-constrained multi-agent robotics.

Abstract: In emergency response missions, first responders must navigate cluttered
indoor environments where occlusions block direct line-of-sight, concealing
both life-threatening hazards and victims in need of rescue. We present STARC,
a see-through AR framework for human-robot collaboration that fuses
mobile-robot mapping with responder-mounted LiDAR sensing. A ground robot
running LiDAR-inertial odometry performs large-area exploration and 3D human
detection, while helmet- or handheld-mounted LiDAR on the responder is
registered to the robot's global map via relative pose estimation. This
cross-LiDAR alignment enables consistent first-person projection of detected
humans and their point clouds - rendered in AR with low latency - into the
responder's view. By providing real-time visualization of hidden occupants and
hazards, STARC enhances situational awareness and reduces operator risk.
Experiments in simulation, lab setups, and tactical field trials confirm robust
pose alignment, reliable detections, and stable overlays, underscoring the
potential of our system for fire-fighting, disaster relief, and other
safety-critical operations. Code and design will be open-sourced upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: 该框架有效避免过早锁定单一解，显著提升模糊场景下的数据关联鲁棒性。

Abstract: Global data association is an essential prerequisite for robot operation in
environments seen at different times or by different robots. Repetitive or
symmetric data creates significant challenges for existing methods, which
typically rely on maximum likelihood estimation or maximum consensus to produce
a single set of associations. However, in ambiguous scenarios, the distribution
of solutions to global data association problems is often highly multimodal,
and such single-solution approaches frequently fail. In this work, we introduce
a data association framework that leverages approximate Bayesian inference to
capture multiple solution modes to the data association problem, thereby
avoiding premature commitment to a single solution under ambiguity. Our
approach represents hypothetical solutions as particles that evolve according
to a deterministic or randomized update rule to cover the modes of the
underlying solution distribution. Furthermore, we show that our method can
incorporate optimization constraints imposed by the data association
formulation and directly benefit from GPU-parallelized optimization. Extensive
simulated and real-world experiments with highly ambiguous data show that our
method correctly estimates the distribution over transformations when
registering point clouds or object maps.

Abstract: This paper proposes a momentum-constrained hybrid heuristic trajectory
optimization framework (MHHTOF) tailored for assistive navigation in visually
impaired scenarios, integrating trajectory sampling generation, optimization
and evaluation with residual-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the
first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the
Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order
polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints
to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the
second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based
temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the
Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with
weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting
human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable
policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by
the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and
training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces
average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle
risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in
enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive
planning tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle localization using roadside LiDARs can provide centimeter-level
accuracy for cloud-controlled vehicles while simultaneously serving multiple
vehicles, enhanc-ing safety and efficiency. While most existing studies rely on
repetitive scanning LiDARs, non-repetitive scanning LiDAR offers advantages
such as eliminating blind zones and being more cost-effective. However, its
application in roadside perception and localization remains limited. To address
this, we present a dataset for infrastructure-based vehicle localization, with
data collected from both repetitive and non-repetitive scanning LiDARs, in
order to benchmark the performance of different LiDAR scanning patterns. The
dataset contains 5,445 frames of point clouds across eight vehicle trajectory
sequences, with diverse trajectory types. Our experiments establish base-lines
for infrastructure-based vehicle localization and compare the performance of
these methods using both non-repetitive and repetitive scanning LiDARs. This
work offers valuable insights for selecting the most suitable LiDAR scanning
pattern for infrastruc-ture-based vehicle localization. Our dataset is a
signifi-cant contribution to the scientific community, supporting advancements
in infrastructure-based perception and vehicle localization. The dataset and

Abstract: Efficiently delivering items to an ongoing surgery in a hospital operating
room can be a matter of life or death. In modern hospital settings, delivery
robots have successfully transported bulk items between rooms and floors.
However, automating item-level operating room logistics presents unique
challenges in perception, efficiency, and maintaining sterility. We propose the
Operating Room Bot (ORB), a robot framework to automate logistics tasks in
hospital operating rooms (OR). ORB leverages a robust, hierarchical behavior
tree (BT) architecture to integrate diverse functionalities of object
recognition, scene interpretation, and GPU-accelerated motion planning. The
contributions of this paper include: (1) a modular software architecture
facilitating robust mobile manipulation through behavior trees; (2) a novel
real-time object recognition pipeline integrating YOLOv7, Segment Anything
Model 2 (SAM2), and Grounded DINO; (3) the adaptation of the cuRobo
parallelized trajectory optimization framework to real-time, collision-free
mobile manipulation; and (4) empirical validation demonstrating an 80% success
rate in OR supply retrieval and a 96% success rate in restocking operations.
These contributions establish ORB as a reliable and adaptable system for

Conclusion: PRIMT有效提升机器人复杂行为学习的效率与可靠性。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising
paradigm for teaching robots complex behaviors without reward engineering.
However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the
reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving
query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we
introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by
leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and
trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM
evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy,
integrating the complementary strengths of large language models and
vision-language models in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and
comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory
generation, which reduces early-stage query ambiguity by warm-starting the
trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, and hindsight trajectory
augmentation, which enables counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary
loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6
manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance
over FM-based and scripted baselines.

Abstract: Miniature robots are untethered actuators, which have significant potential
to make existing minimally invasive surgery considerably safer and painless,
and enable unprecedented treatments because they are much smaller and dexterous
than existing surgical robots. Of the miniature robots, the magnetically
actuated ones are the most functional and dexterous. However, existing magnetic
miniature robots are currently impractical for surgery because they are either
restricted to possessing at most two on-board functionalities or having limited
five degrees-of-freedom (DOF) locomotion. Some of these actuators are also only
operational under specialized environments where actuation from strong external
magnets must be at very close proximity (< 4 cm away). Here we present a
millimeter-scale soft robot where its magnetization profile can be reprogrammed
upon command to perform five surgical functionalities: drug-dispensing, cutting
through biological tissues (simulated with gelatin), gripping, storing
(biological) samples and remote heating. By possessing full six-DOF motions,
including the sixth-DOF rotation about its net magnetic moment, our soft robot
can also roll and two-anchor crawl across challenging unstructured
environments, which are impassable by its five-DOF counterparts. Because our
actuating magnetic fields are relatively uniform and weak (at most 65 mT and
1.5 T/m), such fields can theoretically penetrate through biological tissues
harmlessly and allow our soft robot to remain controllable within the depths of
the human body. We envision that this work marks a major milestone for the
advancement of soft actuators, and towards revolutionizing minimally invasive
treatments with untethered miniature robots that have unprecedented
functionalities.

Abstract: Visual observations from different viewpoints can significantly influence the
performance of visuomotor policies in robotic manipulation. Among these,
egocentric (in-hand) views often provide crucial information for precise
control. However, in some applications, equipping robots with dedicated in-hand
cameras may pose challenges due to hardware constraints, system complexity, and
cost. In this work, we propose to endow robots with imaginative perception -
enabling them to 'imagine' in-hand observations from agent views at inference
time. We achieve this via novel view synthesis (NVS), leveraging a fine-tuned
diffusion model conditioned on the relative pose between the agent and in-hand
views cameras. Specifically, we apply LoRA-based fine-tuning to adapt a
pretrained NVS model (ZeroNVS) to the robotic manipulation domain. We evaluate
our approach on both simulation benchmarks (RoboMimic and MimicGen) and
real-world experiments using a Unitree Z1 robotic arm for a strawberry picking
task. Results show that synthesized in-hand views significantly enhance policy
inference, effectively recovering the performance drop caused by the absence of
real in-hand cameras. Our method offers a scalable and hardware-light solution
for deploying robust visuomotor policies, highlighting the potential of
imaginative visual reasoning in embodied agents.

Conclusion: GP3提供了一种实用、传感器无关的几何感知机器人操作方案。

Abstract: Effective robotic manipulation relies on a precise understanding of 3D scene
geometry, and one of the most straightforward ways to acquire such geometry is
through multi-view observations. Motivated by this, we present GP3 -- a 3D
geometry-aware robotic manipulation policy that leverages multi-view input. GP3
employs a spatial encoder to infer dense spatial features from RGB
observations, which enable the estimation of depth and camera parameters,
leading to a compact yet expressive 3D scene representation tailored for
manipulation. This representation is fused with language instructions and
translated into continuous actions via a lightweight policy head. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that GP3 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on simulated benchmarks. Furthermore, GP3 transfers effectively to
real-world robots without depth sensors or pre-mapped environments, requiring
only minimal fine-tuning. These results highlight GP3 as a practical,
sensor-agnostic solution for geometry-aware robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: SMART框架在保证安全性与运动学可行性的同时，显著提升多车协同规划的可扩展性与实时性。

Abstract: Multi-vehicle trajectory planning is a non-convex problem that becomes
increasingly difficult in dense environments due to the rapid growth of
collision constraints. Efficient exploration of feasible behaviors and
resolution of tight interactions are essential for real-time, large-scale
coordination. This paper introduces SMART, Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and
Trajectory Planning, a hierarchical framework that combines priority-based
search with distributed optimization to achieve efficient and feasible
multi-vehicle planning. The upper layer explores diverse interaction modes
using reinforcement learning-based priority estimation and large-step hybrid A*
search, while the lower layer refines solutions via parallelizable convex
optimization. By partitioning space among neighboring vehicles and constructing
robust feasible corridors, the method decouples the joint non-convex problem
into convex subproblems solved efficiently in parallel. This design alleviates
the step-size trade-off while ensuring kinematic feasibility and collision
avoidance. Experiments show that SMART consistently outperforms baselines. On
50 m x 50 m maps, it sustains over 90% success within 1 s up to 25 vehicles,
while baselines often drop below 50%. On 100 m x 100 m maps, SMART achieves
above 95% success up to 50 vehicles and remains feasible up to 90 vehicles,
with runtimes more than an order of magnitude faster than optimization-only
approaches. Built on vehicle-to-everything communication, SMART incorporates
vehicle-infrastructure cooperation through roadside sensing and agent
coordination, improving scalability and safety. Real-world experiments further
validate this design, achieving planning times as low as 0.014 s while
preserving cooperative behaviors.

Conclusion: FlyKites能有效提升通信受限下多机器人系统的人机协作效率与任务完成能力

Abstract: Fleets of autonomous robots have been deployed for exploration of unknown
scenes for features of interest, e.g., subterranean exploration,
reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. During exploration, the robots may
encounter un-identified targets, blocked passages, interactive objects,
temporary failure, or other unexpected events, all of which require consistent
human assistance with reliable communication for a time period. This however
can be particularly challenging if the communication among the robots is
severely restricted to only close-range exchange via ad-hoc networks,
especially in extreme environments like caves and underground tunnels. This
paper presents a novel human-centric interactive exploration and assistance
framework called FlyKites, for multi-robot systems under limited communication.
It consists of three interleaved components: (I) the distributed exploration
and intermittent communication (called the "spread mode"), where the robots
collaboratively explore the environment and exchange local data among the fleet
and with the operator; (II) the simultaneous optimization of the relay
topology, the operator path, and the assignment of robots to relay roles
(called the "relay mode"), such that all requested assistance can be provided
with minimum delay; (III) the human-in-the-loop online execution, where the
robots switch between different roles and interact with the operator
adaptively. Extensive human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments
are performed over numerous challenging scenes.

Abstract: Drones have recently emerged as a faster, safer, and cost-efficient way for
last-mile deliveries of parcels, particularly for urgent medical deliveries
highlighted during the pandemic. This paper addresses a new challenge of
multi-parcel delivery with a swarm of energy-aware drones, accounting for
time-sensitive customer requirements. Each drone plans an optimal multi-parcel
route within its battery-restricted flight range to minimize delivery delays
and reduce energy consumption. The problem is tackled by decomposing it into
three sub-problems: (1) optimizing depot locations and service areas using
K-means clustering; (2) determining the optimal flight range for drones through
reinforcement learning; and (3) planning and selecting multi-parcel delivery
routes via a new optimized plan selection approach. To integrate these
solutions and enhance long-term efficiency, we propose a novel algorithm
leveraging actor-critic-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.
Extensive experimentation using realistic delivery datasets demonstrate an
exceptional performance of the proposed algorithm. We provide new insights into
economic efficiency (minimize energy consumption), rapid operations (reduce
delivery delays and overall execution time), and strategic guidance on depot
deployment for practical logistics applications.

*Yonghyeon Lee,Tzu-Yuan Lin,Alexander Alexiev,Sangbae Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出纯触觉反馈抓取调整算法，提升抓取稳定性，无需物体几何先验或精确抓取位姿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉抓取系统受标定误差、传感器噪声等限制，导致接触不确定性，需触觉反馈增强鲁棒性。

Method: 设计纯触觉反馈控制器，结合200Hz指尖触觉传感器，在15自由度机械臂手上实现抓取调整。

Result: 仿真与实物实验表明，该框架能有效提升抓取稳定性，即使初始配置粗糙、接触点不确定。

Conclusion: 纯触觉反馈控制器可显著增强抓取鲁棒性，降低对视觉感知精度的依赖。

Abstract: Vision-only grasping systems are fundamentally constrained by calibration
errors, sensor noise, and grasp pose prediction inaccuracies, leading to
unavoidable contact uncertainty in the final stage of grasping. High-bandwidth
tactile feedback, when paired with a well-designed tactile-reactive controller,
can significantly improve robustness in the presence of perception errors. This
paper contributes to controller design by proposing a purely tactile-feedback
grasp-adjustment algorithm. The proposed controller requires neither prior
knowledge of the object's geometry nor an accurate grasp pose, and is capable
of refining a grasp even when starting from a crude, imprecise initial
configuration and uncertain contact points. Through simulation studies and
real-world experiments on a 15-DoF arm-hand system (featuring an 8-DoF hand)
equipped with fingertip tactile sensors operating at 200 Hz, we demonstrate
that our tactile-reactive grasping framework effectively improves grasp
stability.

*An Dinh Vuong,Minh Nhat Vu,Ian Reid*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出eVGGT，一种高效几何感知编码器，在保持3D推理能力的同时显著降低计算开销，提升模仿学习在机器人操作任务中的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB模仿学习方法缺乏显式3D推理能力，而几何感知模型虽有效但计算成本高，难以部署于实际机器人系统。

Method: 将几何感知视觉编码器（如VGGT）集成进模仿学习框架，并蒸馏出轻量版eVGGT以降低计算负担。

Result: 在仿真与真实环境中，eVGGT相比传统编码器最高提升6.5%成功率，同时速度提升9倍、体积缩小5倍。

Conclusion: eVGGT兼顾效率与性能，是推动几何感知机器人实用化的有效方案，相关代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Existing RGB-based imitation learning approaches typically employ traditional
vision encoders such as ResNet or ViT, which lack explicit 3D reasoning
capabilities. Recent geometry-grounded vision models, such as
VGGT~\cite{wang2025vggt}, provide robust spatial understanding and are
promising candidates to address this limitation. This work investigates the
integration of geometry-aware visual representations into robotic manipulation.
Our results suggest that incorporating the geometry-aware vision encoder into
imitation learning frameworks, including ACT and DP, yields up to 6.5%
improvement over standard vision encoders in success rate across single- and
bi-manual manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world settings.
Despite these benefits, most geometry-grounded models require high
computational cost, limiting their deployment in practical robotic systems. To
address this challenge, we propose eVGGT, an efficient geometry-aware encoder
distilled from VGGT. eVGGT is nearly 9 times faster and 5 times smaller than
VGGT, while preserving strong 3D reasoning capabilities. Code and pretrained
models will be released to facilitate further research in geometry-aware
robotics.

Abstract: We present a model predictive control (MPC) framework for efficient
navigation of mobile robots in cluttered environments. The proposed approach
integrates a finite-segment shortest path planner into the finite-horizon
trajectory optimization of the MPC. This formulation ensures convergence to
dynamically selected targets and guarantees collision avoidance, even under
general nonlinear dynamics and cluttered environments. The approach is
validated through hardware experiments on a small ground robot, where a human
operator dynamically assigns target locations. The robot successfully navigated
through complex environments and reached new targets within 2-3 seconds.

Conclusion: VLAC有效统一策略与评价功能，显著提升真实世界机器人学习效率与泛化能力。

Abstract: Robotic real-world reinforcement learning (RL) with vision-language-action
(VLA) models is bottlenecked by sparse, handcrafted rewards and inefficient
exploration. We introduce VLAC, a general process reward model built upon
InternVL and trained on large scale heterogeneous datasets. Given pairwise
observations and a language goal, it outputs dense progress delta and done
signal, eliminating task-specific reward engineering, and supports one-shot
in-context transfer to unseen tasks and environments. VLAC is trained on
vision-language datasets to strengthen perception, dialogic and reasoning
capabilities, together with robot and human trajectories data that ground
action generation and progress estimation, and additionally strengthened to
reject irrelevant prompts as well as detect regression or stagnation by
constructing large numbers of negative and semantically mismatched samples.
With prompt control, a single VLAC model alternately generating reward and
action tokens, unifying critic and policy. Deployed inside an asynchronous
real-world RL loop, we layer a graded human-in-the-loop protocol (offline
demonstration replay, return and explore, human guided explore) that
accelerates exploration and stabilizes early learning. Across four distinct
real-world manipulation tasks, VLAC lifts success rates from about 30\% to
about 90\% within 200 real-world interaction episodes; incorporating
human-in-the-loop interventions yields a further 50% improvement in sample
efficiency and achieves up to 100% final success.

Motivation: 解决衣物翻转任务中动态性强、视觉遮挡严重等挑战，避免依赖人工演示。

Method: 将任务分解为Drag/Fling与Insert&Pull两阶段，使用深度推断的关键点参数化双臂基元，并基于GPU并行MPM模拟器自动生成多样化数据。

Result: 在真实硬件上零样本部署，最高成功率达81.3%。

Conclusion: 任务分解与高保真模拟可有效应对高动态、强遮挡操作任务，无需人工标注或演示。

Abstract: Turning garments right-side out is a challenging manipulation task: it is
highly dynamic, entails rapid contact changes, and is subject to severe visual
occlusion. We introduce Right-Side-Out, a zero-shot sim-to-real framework that
effectively solves this challenge by exploiting task structures. We decompose
the task into Drag/Fling to create and stabilize an access opening, followed by
Insert&Pull to invert the garment. Each step uses a depth-inferred,
keypoint-parameterized bimanual primitive that sharply reduces the action space
while preserving robustness. Efficient data generation is enabled by our
custom-built, high-fidelity, GPU-parallel Material Point Method (MPM) simulator
that models thin-shell deformation and provides robust and efficient contact
handling for batched rollouts. Built on the simulator, our fully automated
pipeline scales data generation by randomizing garment geometry, material
parameters, and viewpoints, producing depth, masks, and per-primitive keypoint
labels without any human annotations. With a single depth camera, policies
trained entirely in simulation deploy zero-shot on real hardware, achieving up
to 81.3% success rate. By employing task decomposition and high fidelity
simulation, our framework enables tackling highly dynamic, severely occluded
tasks without laborious human demonstrations.

TL;DR: 提出Swarm Oracle，利用机器人集群实现区块链对现实数据的去中心化验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有预言机方案降低自主性、透明性或重新引入信任需求的问题。

Method: 采用多利益相关方的机器人集群，结合拜占庭容错协议与基于代币的声誉系统。

Result: 实验证明系统可在高比例恶意机器人攻击下达成共识并自主恢复。

Conclusion: Swarm Oracle为区块链提供安全、无信任、全球共识的现实数据接入方案。

Abstract: Blockchain consensus, rooted in the principle ``don't trust, verify'', limits
access to real-world data, which may be ambiguous or inaccessible to some
participants. Oracles address this limitation by supplying data to blockchains,
but existing solutions may reduce autonomy, transparency, or reintroduce the
need for trust. We propose Swarm Oracle: a decentralized network of autonomous
robots -- that is, a robot swarm -- that use onboard sensors and peer-to-peer
communication to collectively verify real-world data and provide it to smart
contracts on public blockchains. Swarm Oracle leverages the built-in
decentralization, fault tolerance and mobility of robot swarms, which can
flexibly adapt to meet information requests on-demand, even in remote
locations. Unlike typical cooperative robot swarms, Swarm Oracle integrates
robots from multiple stakeholders, protecting the system from single-party
biases but also introducing potential adversarial behavior. To ensure the
secure, trustless and global consensus required by blockchains, we employ a
Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that enables robots from different
stakeholders to operate together, reaching social agreements of higher quality
than the estimates of individual robots. Through extensive experiments using
both real and simulated robots, we showcase how consensus on uncertain
environmental information can be achieved, despite several types of attacks
orchestrated by large proportions of the robots, and how a reputation system
based on blockchain tokens lets Swarm Oracle autonomously recover from faults
and attacks, a requirement for long-term operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶系统在长尾安全关键场景中表现不足，且VLA模型受限于数据质量与学习效率。

Method: 结合开源驾驶QA数据微调模型，再于CAVE仿真平台收集接管数据，并通过DPO优化模型行为。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准上，DS达72.18、SR达50%，分别领先SOTA方法7.96和15%。

Conclusion: CoReVLA能持续从接管经验中学习，有效提升长尾场景决策能力。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems have made notable progress, but their
performance in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios remains limited. These rare
cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action
(VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution,
but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and
inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework
that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage
process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly
fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to
acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is
deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation
platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions.
Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle
reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid
reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and
closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can
accurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the
Bench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a
Success Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and
15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies
demonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in
similar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences. All
codea and preprocessed datasets are available at:

Conclusion: 该架构能有效支持人类通过自然语言监控机器人执行复杂活动，提升自动化系统的灵活性与安全性。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in automating labor-intensive
and complex activities, i.e., those consisting of multiple atomic tasks, by
deploying robots in dynamic and unpredictable environments such as industrial
and agricultural settings. A key characteristic of these contexts is that
activities are not predefined: while they involve a limited set of possible
tasks, their combinations may vary depending on the situation. Moreover,
despite recent advances in robotics, the ability for humans to monitor the
progress of high-level activities - in terms of past, present, and future
actions - remains fundamental to ensure the correct execution of
safety-critical processes. In this paper, we introduce a general architecture
that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning, enabling
humans to specify high-level activities (also referred to as processes) using
natural language, and to monitor their execution by querying a robot. We also
present an implementation of this architecture using state-of-the-art
components and quantitatively evaluate the approach in a real-world precision
agriculture scenario.

Method: 设计可调节高度的移动服务机器人，通过实验比较95cm和132cm两种高度下参与者对填写300题问卷请求的遵从率。

Result: 较矮机器人（95cm）的请求获得更高遵从率，与人类身高影响模式相反。

Conclusion: 机器人设计不能直接套用人类社会动态规律，需经实证测试。

Abstract: Robots come in various forms and have different characteristics that may
shape the interaction with them. In human-human interactions, height is a
characteristic that shapes human dynamics, with taller people typically
perceived as more persuasive. In this work, we aspired to evaluate if the same
impact replicates in a human-robot interaction and specifically with a highly
non-humanoid robotic object. The robot was designed with modules that could be
easily added or removed, allowing us to change its height without altering
other design features. To test the impact of the robot's height, we evaluated
participants' compliance with its request to volunteer to perform a tedious
task. In the experiment, participants performed a cognitive task on a computer,
which was framed as the main experiment. When done, they were informed that the
experiment was completed. While waiting to receive their credits, the robotic
object, designed as a mobile robotic service table, entered the room, carrying
a tablet that invited participants to complete a 300-question questionnaire
voluntarily. We compared participants' compliance in two conditions: A Short
robot composed of two modules and 95cm in height and a Tall robot consisting of
three modules and 132cm in height. Our findings revealed higher compliance with
the Short robot's request, demonstrating an opposite pattern to human dynamics.
We conclude that while height has a substantial social impact on human-robot
interactions, it follows a unique pattern of influence. Our findings suggest
that designers cannot simply adopt and implement elements from human social
dynamics to robots without testing them first.

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理任意非凸几何形状机器人的避障问题，尤其在未知构型下计算复杂或不可行。

Method: 训练残差神经网络预测机器人与障碍物间隙，构建局部安全球并编码为离散时间高阶控制屏障函数，结合非线性优化与松弛技术确保连续时间无碰撞。

Result: 实验表明该方法可在毫秒级内生成无碰撞、动力学可行轨迹，预测精度高，优于现有CBF方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持任意几何（含非凸）机器人在复杂环境中的安全高效导航。

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is central to safe navigation, especially for robots with
arbitrary and nonconvex geometries operating in cluttered environments.
Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) approaches often rely on analytic
clearance computations, which are infeasible for complex geometries, or on
polytopic approximations, which become intractable when robot configurations
are unknown. To address these limitations, this paper trains a residual neural
network on a large dataset of robot-obstacle configurations to enable fast and
tractable clearance prediction, even at unseen configurations. The predicted
clearance defines the radius of a Local Safety Ball (LSB), which ensures
continuous-time collision-free navigation. The LSB boundary is encoded as a
Discrete-Time High-Order CBF (DHOCBF), whose constraints are incorporated into
a nonlinear optimization framework. To improve feasibility, a novel relaxation
technique is applied. The resulting framework ensure that the robot's
rigid-body motion between consecutive time steps remains collision-free,
effectively bridging discrete-time control and continuous-time safety. We show
that the proposed method handles arbitrary, including nonconvex, robot
geometries and generates collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories in
cluttered environments. Experiments demonstrate millisecond-level solve times
and high prediction accuracy, highlighting both safety and efficiency beyond
existing CBF-based methods.

Result: 在仿真与真实世界操作任务中，相比现有方法显著提高成功率。

Conclusion: 该框架有效增强机器人在长视野任务中的鲁棒性与组合泛化能力。

Abstract: A key requirement for generalist robots is compositional generalization - the
ability to combine atomic skills to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. While
prior work has primarily focused on synthesizing a planner that sequences
pre-learned skills, robust execution of the individual skills themselves
remains challenging, as visuomotor policies often fail under distribution
shifts induced by scene composition. To address this, we introduce a scene
graph-based representation that focuses on task-relevant objects and relations,
thereby mitigating sensitivity to irrelevant variation. Building on this idea,
we develop a scene-graph skill learning framework that integrates graph neural
networks with diffusion-based imitation learning, and further combine "focused"
scene-graph skills with a vision-language model (VLM) based task planner.
Experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate
substantially higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines,
highlighting improved robustness and compositional generalization in
long-horizon tasks.

Result: 在H1人形与Solo12四足机器人仿真与硬件上成功实现loco-manipulation任务。

Conclusion: 该方法有效扩展了机器人运动控制能力，为复杂任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although humanoid and quadruped robots provide a wide range of capabilities,
current control methods, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning, focus mainly on
single skills. This approach is inefficient for solving more complicated tasks
where high-level goals, physical robot limitations and desired motion style
might all need to be taken into account. A more effective approach is to first
train a multipurpose motion policy that acquires low-level skills through
imitation, while providing latent space control over skill execution. Then,
this policy can be used to efficiently solve downstream tasks. This method has
already been successful for controlling characters in computer graphics. In
this work, we apply the approach to humanoid and quadrupedal loco-manipulation
by imitating either simple synthetic motions or kinematically retargeted dog
motions. We extend the original formulation to handle constraints, ensuring
deployment safety, and use a diffusion discriminator for better imitation
quality. We verify our methods by performing loco-manipulation in simulation
for the H1 humanoid and Solo12 quadruped, as well as deploying policies on
Solo12 hardware. Videos and code are available at

Abstract: Learning whole-body mobile manipulation via imitation is essential for
generalizing robotic skills to diverse environments and complex tasks. However,
this goal is hindered by significant challenges, particularly in effectively
processing complex observation, achieving robust generalization, and generating
coherent actions. To address these issues, we propose DSPv2, a novel policy
architecture. DSPv2 introduces an effective encoding scheme that aligns 3D
spatial features with multi-view 2D semantic features. This fusion enables the
policy to achieve broad generalization while retaining the fine-grained
perception necessary for precise control. Furthermore, we extend the Dense
Policy paradigm to the whole-body mobile manipulation domain, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generating coherent and precise actions for the whole-body
robotic platform. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both task performance and generalization
ability. Project page is available at: https://selen-suyue.github.io/DSPv2Net/.

Conclusion: I-FailSense有效提升机器人对语义错位失败的检测能力，增强开放世界任务执行的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Language-conditioned robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not
only accurate task execution but also the ability to detect failures for robust
deployment in real-world environments. Although recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning
and task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability
to recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored
challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot
executes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given
instruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets
targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing
language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an
open-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for
failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by
training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to
different internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using
an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms
state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting
semantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic
misalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure
categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and
real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are
publicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage:

control approach capable of reasoning about unsteady aerodynamics. Our approach
relies on a lightweight vortex particle model, parallelized to allow GPU
acceleration, and a sampling-based policy optimization strategy capable of
leveraging the vortex particle model for predictive reasoning. We demonstrate,
through both simulation and hardware experiments, that by replanning with our
unsteady aerodynamics model, we can improve the performance of aggressive
post-stall maneuvers in the presence of unsteady environmental flow
disturbances.

Abstract: We provide a method for detecting and localizing objects near a robot arm
using arm-mounted miniature time-of-flight sensors. A key challenge when using
arm-mounted sensors is differentiating between the robot itself and external
objects in sensor measurements. To address this challenge, we propose a
computationally lightweight method which utilizes the raw time-of-flight
information captured by many off-the-shelf, low-resolution time-of-flight
sensor. We build an empirical model of expected sensor measurements in the
presence of the robot alone, and use this model at runtime to detect objects in
proximity to the robot. In addition to avoiding robot self-detections in common
sensor configurations, the proposed method enables extra flexibility in sensor
placement, unlocking configurations which achieve more efficient coverage of a
radius around the robot arm. Our method can detect small objects near the arm
and localize the position of objects along the length of a robot link to
reasonable precision. We evaluate the performance of the method with respect to
object type, location, and ambient light level, and identify limiting factors
on performance inherent in the measurement principle. The proposed method has
potential applications in collision avoidance and in facilitating safe
human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a major challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), often requiring considerable human expertise and
iterative refinement. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for
automated reward design, but these approaches are limited by hallucinations,
reliance on human feedback, and challenges with handling complex, multi-step
tasks. In this work, we introduce Reward Evolution with Graph-of-Thoughts
(RE-GoT), a novel bi-level framework that enhances LLMs with structured
graph-based reasoning and integrates Visual Language Models (VLMs) for
automated rollout evaluation. RE-GoT first decomposes tasks into
text-attributed graphs, enabling comprehensive analysis and reward function
generation, and then iteratively refines rewards using visual feedback from
VLMs without human intervention. Extensive experiments on 10 RoboGen and 4
ManiSkill2 tasks demonstrate that RE-GoT consistently outperforms existing
LLM-based baselines. On RoboGen, our method improves average task success rates
by 32.25%, with notable gains on complex multi-step tasks. On ManiSkill2,
RE-GoT achieves an average success rate of 93.73% across four diverse
manipulation tasks, significantly surpassing prior LLM-based approaches and
even exceeding expert-designed rewards. Our results indicate that combining
LLMs and VLMs with graph-of-thoughts reasoning provides a scalable and
effective solution for autonomous reward evolution in RL.

Abstract: Fish-inspired aquatic robots are gaining increasing attention in research
communities due to their high swimming speeds and efficient propulsion enabled
by flexible bodies that generate undulatory motions. To support the design
optimizations and control of such systems, accurate, interpretable, and
computationally tractable modeling of the underlying swimming dynamics is
indispensable. In this letter, we present a full-body dynamics model for fish
swimming, rigorously derived from Hamilton's principle. The model captures the
continuously distributed elasticity of a deformable fish body undergoing large
deformations and incorporates fluid-structure coupling effects, enabling
self-propelled motion without prescribing kinematics. A preliminary parameter
study explores the influence of actuation frequency and body stiffness on
swimming speed and cost of transport (COT). Simulation results indicate that
swimming speed and energy efficiency exhibit opposing trends with tail-beat
frequency and that both body stiffness and body length have distinct optimal
values. These findings provide insights into biological swimming mechanisms and
inform the design of high-performance soft robotic swimmers.

Abstract: We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic
Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by
natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main
limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require
manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent,
which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we
propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models
(VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable
indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language
retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian
optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a
motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC
through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating
that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor
scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results
highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from
open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.
