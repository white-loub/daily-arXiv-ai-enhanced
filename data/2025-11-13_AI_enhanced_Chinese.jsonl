Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8282\u7701\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709O(h^2)\u622a\u65ad\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6a21\u677f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u9ad8\u65af\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u79e9\u7f3a\u9677\u635f\u5931\u4e2d\u7684Hessian\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46GPU\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u975eCAD\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u66f2\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684SDF\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our physically-based rendering approach simulates light transmission using flux, without requiring prior knowledge of the light source's intensity distribution. To efficiently explore the light source parameter space during optimization, we apply a contraction mapping that converts the constrained problem into an unconstrained one.

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Preprint, under review for Eurographics 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity.

However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models.

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff08AMR\uff09\u56fe\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u82f1\u6587\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3aAnswer Set Programming\uff08ASP\uff09\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u751f\u6210ASP\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9LLM\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba9\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0eASP\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u73b0\u6709\u7eafLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65f6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210AMR\u56fe\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790AMR\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6784\u5efaASP\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u82f1\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6574\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8fd0\u884c\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eafLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff08AMR\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff08MAC\uff09\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0cMAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u7684\u8fb9\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u957f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u57472\u500d\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u89e3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u56fe\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7fMAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization.

However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \\our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.

However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality-level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NeuroCLIP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411EEG\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5c06CLIP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5176\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3EEG\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u751f\u7406-\u7b26\u53f7\u9e3f\u6c9f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u4ee4\u724c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u6001\u7ea7\u5168\u5c40\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u8111\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u539f\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728THINGS-EEG2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNeuroCLIP\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe63.2%\uff0c\u8f83\u5148\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534712.3%\uff1b\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bTop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6865\u63a5\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4e3a\u8111\u542f\u53d1AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost.

Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop.

As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning.

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores.

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps.

MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark.

We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance.

These perception modules are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty, often failing when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) measurements not seen during training. To address this gap, we introduce ATOM-CBF (Adaptive-To-OoD-Measurement Control Barrier Function), a novel safe control framework that explicitly computes and adapts to the epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, without the need for ground-truth labels or information on distribution shifts. Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time. We provide empirical validation in simulations, demonstrating that ATOM-CBF maintains safety for an F1Tenth vehicle with LiDAR scans and a quadruped robot with RGB images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aATOM-CBF\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u969c\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9047\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4fe1\u606f\u5373\u53ef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u9762\u5411\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b(2) \u7ed3\u5408\u8be5\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728F1Tenth\u8f66\u8f86\uff08LiDAR\uff09\u548c\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08RGB\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ATOM-CBF\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ATOM-CBF\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions.

We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem.

Fourth, how state-of-the-art embedding models handle proper-name identity signals and conversational noise remains opaque. To address these, we contribute: (1) RA-nWG@K, a rarity-aware, per-query-normalized set score, and operational ceilings via the pool-restricted oracle ceiling (PROC) and the percentage of PROC (%PROC) to separate retrieval from ordering headroom within a Cost-Latency-Quality (CLQ) lens; (2) rag-gs (MIT), a lean golden-set pipeline with Plackett-Luce listwise refinement whose iterative updates outperform single-shot LLM ranking; (3) a comprehensive benchmark on a production RAG (scientific-papers corpus) spanning dense retrieval, hybrid dense+BM25, embedding models and dimensions, cross-encoder rerankers, ANN (HNSW), and quantization; and (4) targeted diagnostics that quantify proper-name identity signal and conversational-noise sensitivity via identity-destroying and formatting ablations.

To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized framework for learning multi-round communication protocols that are both effective and efficient. Within this framework, we propose three novel Communication Efficiency Metrics (CEMs) to guide and evaluate the learning process: the Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) for efficiency-augmented optimization, and the Topology Efficiency Index (TEI) for explicit evaluation. We integrate IEI and SEI as the adjusted loss functions to promote informative messaging and role specialization, while using TEI to quantify the trade-off between communication volume and task performance.

Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $\u03b1$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $\u03b1$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \\emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684POMDP\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3aNeural Value Iteration\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21POMDP\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPOMDP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u03b1-\u5411\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u7ef4\u5ea6\u968f\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u589e\u957f\u800c\u6025\u5267\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u51f8\uff08PWLC\uff09\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u7528\u4e00\u7ec4\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u03b1-\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u8868\u793a\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u51faNeural Value Iteration\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u5927\u89c4\u6a21POMDP\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "Neural Value Iteration\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21POMDP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping.

These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u89e3\u8bfb\u7f8e\u56fd\u6cd5\u5178\u7b2c18\u7f16\u7b2c175\u6761\uff08\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5bf9\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aLLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5371\u9669\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5982\u5236\u9020\u751f\u7269\u6b66\u5668\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u8fdd\u6cd5\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u751f\u6210\u7981\u4ee4\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u5224\u65ad\u975e\u6cd5\u610f\u56fe\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u751f\u6210\u8fdd\u89c4\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5224\u65ad\u6cd5\u5f8b\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u5b88\u6cd5\u7684\u52a9\u624b\u800c\u975e\u8fdd\u6cd5\u7684\u5e2e\u51f6\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fr\u00e9chet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness.

This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment.

Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6Bi-RAR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u53cc\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u679c\u76d1\u7763\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Bi-RAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7ea7\u8054\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBi-RAR\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "Bi-RAR\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

However, motion planning in real-time within unknown, changing environments remains a challenge for such robots due to the high dimensionality of the configuration space and the complex collision-avoidance constraints that must be obeyed. In this work, we propose a novel way to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by leveraging the structure imposed by shared joints (e.g. torso joints) in a dual-arm robot. First, we build two dynamic roadmaps (DRM) for each kinematic chain (i.e. left arm + torso, right arm + torso) with specific structure induced by the shared joints. Then, we show that we can leverage this structure to efficiently search through the composition of the two roadmaps and largely sidestep the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we run several experiments in a real-world grocery store with this motion planner on a 19 DoF mobile manipulation robot executing a grocery fulfillment task, achieving 0.4s average planning times with 99.9% success rate across more than 2000 motion plans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u7ef4\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u590d\u6742\u907f\u969c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8282\uff08\u5982\u8eaf\u5e72\u5173\u8282\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u94fe\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff08DRM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u4e24\u4e2a\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6742\u8d27\u5e97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf919\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u6742\u8d27\u914d\u9001\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a0.4\u79d2\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc72000\u6b21\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523099.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration.

While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction.

Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios.

We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u7269\u4ea4\u6d41\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAI\u5e76\u975e\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u8eab\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u79cd\u4ea4\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u906e\u853d\u6216\u626d\u66f2\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u54f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u8bb8\u715c\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u6027\u4e0e\u5076\u7136\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u53cc\u91cd\u5076\u7136\u6027\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u60f3\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u2018\u5916\u4ea4\u5f0f\u63a5\u89e6\u2019\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u58f0\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5f53\u4e00\u79cd\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\uff08\u5982AI\uff09\u906d\u9047\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\uff08\u5982\u52a8\u7269\u4ea4\u6d41\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u5728\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u626d\u66f2\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u53cd\u601dAI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u4ea4\u6d41\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u52a9\u54f2\u5b66\u5bb6Yuk Hui\u5173\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u6027\u4e0e\u5076\u7136\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u52a8\u7269\u901a\u4fe1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6280\u672f\u67b6\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u2018\u53cc\u91cd\u5076\u7136\u6027\u2019\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u7269\u79cd\u4ea4\u6d41\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u751f\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u800cAI\u5904\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f20\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7406\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u5e76\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c06AI\u4ece\u2018\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u5de5\u5177\u2019\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u2018\u8ba4\u77e5\u5916\u4ea4\u8005\u2019\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u58f0\u5b66AI\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u9012\u5f52\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u7eb3\u5165\u8de8\u8ba4\u77e5\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u5177\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

HAUNT: A Framework to Probe LLMs' Self-consistency Via Adversarial Nudge", "comment": null, "summary": "Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain.

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise.

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing.

However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario.

However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6RS-Net\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff08DSGG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DSGG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u975e\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5e26\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684RS-Net\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5173\u7cfb\u5f97\u5206\u878d\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Action Genome\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRS-Net\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Recall\u548cPrecision\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5e73\u5747Recall\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "RS-Net\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aDSGG\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MAKER\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6295\u7968\u7ea0\u9519\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u767e\u4e07\u6b65\u4ee5\u4e0a\u96f6\u9519\u8bef\u7684LLM\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDAPs\uff09\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7531\u4e13\u6ce8\u7684\u5fae\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "MAKER\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u6b65\u7684LLM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u65e0\u4efb\u4f55\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6781\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDAPs\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u7eaf\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition.

The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism.

Version with Appendix", "summary": "Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks.

Existing zero-shot studies have shown that incorporating memory mechanisms to support goal-directed behavior can improve long-horizon planning performance. However, they overlook visual frontier boundaries, which fundamentally dictate future trajectories and observations, and fall short of inferring the relationship between partial visual observations and navigation goals. In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\\% in accuracy. Further analysis demonstrates that its core components lead to improved calibration, stronger generalization, and higher decision quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSCOPE\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u524d\u6cbf\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f5c\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u524d\u6cbf\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "SCOPE\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f5c\u529b\u56fe\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8fb9\u754c\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u987e\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u5148\u524d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCOPE\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd54.6%\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SCOPE\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u524d\u6cbf\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5177\u8eab\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines.

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data.

One of the promising approaches to tackle this problem is Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) -- a framework that is naturally suited to handle any robot motion model and provides strong theoretical guarantees. Still, in practice MPPI-based controller may provide suboptimal trajectories as its performance relies heavily on uninformed random sampling. In this work, we introduce CoRL-MPPI, a novel fusion of Cooperative Reinforcement Learning and MPPI to address this limitation. We train an action policy (approximated as deep neural network) in simulation that learns local cooperative collision avoidance behaviors. This learned policy is then embedded into the MPPI framework to guide its sampling distribution, biasing it towards more intelligent and cooperative actions. Notably, CoRL-MPPI preserves all the theoretical guarantees of regular MPPI. We evaluate our approach in dense, dynamic simulation environments against state-of-the-art baselines, including ORCA, BVC, and a multi-agent MPPI implementation.

To unlock the full potential of VLMs in robotics, we shift their role from passive observers to active strategists in the navigation process. Our framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM, which leverages its contextual understanding to guide a frontier-based exploration agent. This intelligent guidance is achieved through a trio of techniques: structured chain-of-thought prompting that elicits logical, step-by-step reasoning; dynamic inclusion of the agent's recent action history to prevent getting stuck in loops; and a novel capability that enables the VLM to interpret top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. When tested on challenging benchmarks like HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D, this method produces exceptionally direct and logical trajectories, marking a substantial improvement in navigation efficiency over existing approaches and charting a path toward more capable embodied agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u5386\u53f2\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528VLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9VLM\u66f4\u4e3b\u52a8\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06VLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u969c\u788d\u56fe\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728HM3D\u3001Gibson\u548cMP3D\u7b49\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8d4b\u4e88VLM\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement.

For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\u7b49\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u5747\u800c\u7ee7\u627f\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u53d1\u8272\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u91d1\u53d1\u4e0e\u5973\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u6b64\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\u5bf9Stable Diffusion\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u7ec4\u5185\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u7684DreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u518d\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eSOTA\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Group-DRO\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u4e25\u91cd\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u662f\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making. To adapt to diverse downstream tasks and further enhance the quality of multi-level fusion, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance the BEV representations. We further extend MoE into the decoder to better capture diverse motion patterns. Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, a 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and a 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared with UniV2X, showcasing the strength of our MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUniMM-V2X\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Mixture-of-Experts\uff08MoE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3aBEV\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u8f66\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\u548c\u5b64\u7acb\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c4\u5212\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniMM-V2X\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u534f\u4f5c\uff1b\u5f15\u5165MoE\u67b6\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u5f3aBEV\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u534f\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR-V2X\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4UniV2X\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534739.7%\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e7.2%\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534733.2%\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u534f\u540c\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8de8\u5c42\u7ea7\u534f\u540c\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set.

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aArgus\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u97e7\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADS\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9a7e\u9a76\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u9002\u65f6\u4ecb\u5165\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9053\u8def\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aArgus\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7ADS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u7f1d\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\u6743\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefADS\uff08TCP\u3001UniAD\u3001VAD\uff09\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cArgus\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347ADS\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe150.30%\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1164.38%\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics. However, challenges such as premature convergence and lack of solution diversity still hinder their performance in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. EDMO integrates three novel strategies: (1) a Dynamic Quantum Tunneling Optimization Strategy (DQTOS) to enable particles to probabilistically escape local optima; (2) a Bio-phototactic Dynamic Focusing Search Strategy (BDFSS) inspired by microbial phototaxis for adaptive local refinement; and (3) an Orthogonal Lens Opposition-Based Learning (OLOBL) strategy to enhance global exploration through structured dimensional recombination. EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy. Furthermore, real-world validations on UAV three-dimensional path planning and three engineering design tasks confirm its practical applicability and effectiveness in field robotics missions requiring intelligent, adaptive, and time-efficient planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u7ef4\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u77ee\u7374\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08EDMO\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u96a7\u7a7f\u3001\u751f\u7269\u8d8b\u5149\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u955c\u50cf\u5bf9\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u65e9\u719f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e09\u7ef4\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEDMO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u96a7\u7a7f\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08DQTOS\uff09\u5e2e\u52a9\u8df3\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u751f\u7269\u8d8b\u5149\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7126\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff08BDFSS\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u7ec6\u641c\u7d22\uff1b\u6b63\u4ea4\u955c\u50cf\u5bf9\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\uff08OLOBL\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728CEC2017\u548cCEC2020\u517139\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cEDMO\u4f18\u4e8e14\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e09\u7ef4\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4e09\u9879\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EDMO\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6025\u8bca\u533b\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ecb\u4e8e58%\u81f365%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aMEDAS\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210Gemini\u3001Llama\u3001Grok\u3001GPT\u548cClaude\u4e94\u4e2aLLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f370%\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u8fbe\u523085%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u6025\u8bca\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6025\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Gemini\u3001Llama\u3001Grok\u3001GPT\u3001Claude\uff09\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6025\u8bca\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MEDAS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4e94\u79cdLLM\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a58%\u201365%\uff0c\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u533b\u751f\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u6c34\u5e73\uff1bMEDAS\u8d85\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u523070%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4e2d\u67d0\u4e00LLM\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe85%\u3002\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4efb\u4e00\u5355\u72ec\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6025\u8bca\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0cMEDAS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u533b\u751f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56feKolmogorov-Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PoseKAN\uff09\u76842D\u52303D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8fb9\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfGCN\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GCN\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPoseKAN\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fb9\u51fd\u6570\u66ff\u4ee3\u56fa\u5b9a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u8df3\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u3001\u6b8b\u5deePoseKAN\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u54cd\u5e94\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57282D-to-3D\u59ff\u6001\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PoseKAN\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LyapInf\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u7a0b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f30\u8ba1\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u7a0b\u663e\u5f0f\u5f62\u5f0f\u6765\u6784\u9020Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\uff09\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u7a0b\u672a\u77e5\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u7a0b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLyapInf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbeLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Zubov\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u62df\u5408\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u7684\u692d\u7403\u5f62\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "LyapInf\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u3002"}}

This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining.

However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements!

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\\%-6.4\\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\\%$ to $7\\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OR-R1\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u518d\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08TGRPO\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "OR-R1\u4ec5\u7528\u5341\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5373\u8fbe\u523067.7%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6c42\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4ORLM\u9ad8\u51fa4.2%\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528100\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u4ecd\u9886\u51482.4%\uff1bTGRPO\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u59163.1%-6.4%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06Pass@1\u4e0ePass@8\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece13%\u7f29\u5c0f\u52307%\u3002", "conclusion": "OR-R1\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u95e8\u69db\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Expanding these domains requires addressing safety assurance under diverse conditions. Information sharing through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, enabled by a Dynamic Map platform built from vehicle and roadside sensor data, offers a promising solution. Real-world experiments with numerous infrastructure sensors incur high costs and regulatory challenges. Conventional single-host simulators lack the capacity for large-scale urban traffic scenarios. This paper proposes D-AWSIM, a distributed simulator that partitions its workload across multiple machines to support the simulation of extensive sensor deployment and dense traffic environments. A Dynamic Map generation framework on D-AWSIM enables researchers to explore information-sharing strategies without relying on physical testbeds. The evaluation shows that D-AWSIM increases throughput for vehicle count and LiDAR sensor processing substantially compared to a single-machine setup.

While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection.

Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input.

However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u6cd5DP-PMLF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9010\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u526a\u88c1\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u5355\u72ec\u5e94\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u526a\u88c1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDP-PMLF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9010\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u91cf\u5728\u526a\u88c1\u524d\u5e73\u6ed1\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6765\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u6d88\u8017\u989d\u5916\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709DPSGD\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "DP-PMLF\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u526a\u88c1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details.

Despite the recent advancements in motion tracking, most existing methods demand extensive tuning and rely on reference data during deployment, limiting adaptability. We present APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient Exploration), a plug-and-play extension to state-of-the-art motion tracking algorithms that eliminates any dependence on reference data during deployment, improves sample efficiency, and reduces parameter tuning effort. APEX integrates expert demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is combined with a multi-critic framework that balances task performance with motion style. Moreover, APEX enables a single policy to learn diverse motions and transfer reference-like styles across different terrains and velocities, while remaining robust to variations in reward design. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation and on a Unitree Go2 robot. By leveraging demonstrations to guide exploration during RL training, without imposing explicit bias toward them, APEX enables legged robots to learn with greater stability, efficiency, and generalization. We believe this approach paves the way for guidance-driven RL to boost natural skill acquisition in a wide array of robotic tasks, from locomotion to manipulation.

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5SiPF\u548cRIAttnConv\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff08shadow\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b33D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u5bf9\u79f0\u90e8\u4ef6\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53d7\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e22\u5931\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u65cb\u8f6c\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff08shadow\uff09\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1RIAttnConv\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408SiPF\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eBingham\u5206\u5e03\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4dshadow\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5224\u522b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u574d\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8fa8\u522b\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance.

Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios.

We present a unified framework enabling independent torque and stiffness commands in real-time for diverse soft actuator types. Our unified force law captures diverse soft muscle physics in a single model with sub-ms computation, while our cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics maintains decoupling despite model errors and disturbances. Using co-contraction/bias coordinates, the controller independently modulates torque via bias and stiffness via co-contraction-replicating biological impedance strategies. Simulation-based validation through contact experiments demonstrates maintained independence: 200x faster settling on soft surfaces, 81% force reduction on rigid surfaces, and stable interaction vs 22-54% stability for fixed policies.

However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u81ea\u8ff0\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u8868\u660eNLP\u6280\u672f\u6709\u671b\u8f85\u52a9\u957f\u671f\u76d1\u6d4b\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4f53\u9a8c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u75be\u75c5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u60c5\u7eea\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u8ba4\u77e5\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u9690\u6666\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53d9\u8ff0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eBio_ClinicalBERT\u7684\u8de8\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4f7f\u7528QLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684GPT-4o mini\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u4e03\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8F1\u5206\u6570\uff08micro-average 0.74\uff0cmacro-average 0.59\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u2018\u601d\u7ef4\u2019\u548c\u2018\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u2019\u7b49\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1bBio_ClinicalBERT\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u56e0\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u6027\u800c\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eNLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u795e\u7ecf\u5fc3\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B.

The two most critical attributes of a dataset are the amount of information it provides and how easily this information can be learned by models. However, the multimodal nature of embodied data makes evaluating these properties particularly challenging. Prior work has largely focused on diversity, typically counting tasks and scenes or evaluating isolated modalities, which fails to provide a comprehensive picture of dataset diversity. On the other hand, the learnability of datasets has received little attention and is usually assessed post-hoc through model training, an expensive, time-consuming process that also lacks interpretability, offering little guidance on how to improve a dataset. In this work, we address both challenges by introducing two principled, data-driven tools. First, we construct a unified multimodal representation for each data sample and, based on it, propose diversity entropy, a continuous measure that characterizes the amount of information contained in a dataset. Second, we introduce the first interpretable, data-driven algorithm to efficiently quantify dataset learnability without training, enabling researchers to assess a dataset's learnability immediately upon its release. We validate our algorithm on both simulated and real-world embodied datasets, demonstrating that it yields faithful, actionable insights that enable researchers to jointly improve diversity and learnability.

Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text.

Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model.

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations.

However, current research predominantly relies on data-driven approaches that necessitate extensive training datasets to achieve robust multimodal decision-making capabilities and generalizable visuomotor control. These methods raise concerns due to the neglect of geometric reasoning in unseen scenarios and the inefficient modeling of robot-target relationships within the training data, resulting in significant waste of training resources. To address these limitations, we present the Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy (RGMP), an end-to-end framework that unifies geometric-semantic skill reasoning with data-efficient visuomotor control. For perception capabilities, we propose the Geometric-prior Skill Selector, which infuses geometric inductive biases into a vision language model, producing adaptive skill sequences for unseen scenes with minimal spatial common sense tuning. To achieve data-efficient robotic motion synthesis, we introduce the Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network, which parameterizes robot-object interactions as a compact hierarchy of Gaussian processes that recursively encode multi-scale spatial relationships, yielding dexterous, data-efficient motion synthesis even from sparse demonstrations. Evaluated on both our humanoid robot and desktop dual-arm robot, the RGMP framework achieves 87% task success in generalization tests and exhibits 5x greater data efficiency than the state-of-the-art model.

Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation.

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task.

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches.

We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks.

However, its performance degrades in degenerate environments, such as long corridors and high-altitude flights, where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation. In this letter, we present LODESTAR, a novel LIO method that addresses these degeneracies through two key modules: degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF) and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE). DA-ASKF employs a sliding window to utilize past states and measurements as additional constraints. Specifically, it introduces degeneracy-aware sliding modes that adaptively classify states as active or fixed based on their degeneracy level. Using Schmidt-Kalman update, it partially optimizes active states while preserving fixed states. These fixed states influence the update of active states via their covariances, serving as reference anchors--akin to a lodestar. Additionally, DA-DE prunes less-informative measurements from active states and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states, based on their localizability contribution and the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Consequently, DA-ASKF enables degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and mitigates measurement sparsity, while DA-DE addresses measurement imbalance.

Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals.

Webb", "Geoffrey Mackellar"], "title": "EEG-X: Device-Agnostic and Noise-Robust Foundation Model for EEG", "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch.

For humanoid robots, human videos and motion data are abundant and widely available, offering a free and large-scale data source. Besides, the semantics related to the motions enable modality alignment and high-level robot control learning. However, how to effectively mine raw video, extract robot-learnable representations, and leverage them for scalable learning remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos. The dataset can be further expanded via the same pipeline. Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods.

While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u65f6\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u8d8a\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u51c6\u786e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u9891\u5f15\u7528\u6587\u732e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u5f15\u6587\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u865a\u6784\u6587\u732e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u77e5\u8bc6\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8fd8\u662f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4.1\u751f\u6210100\u4e2a\u8de820\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f15\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ea61000\u6b21\u5f15\u7528\u540e\uff0c\u6587\u732e\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4e4e\u88ab\u9010\u5b57\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b\u5f53\u591a\u7bc7\u9ad8\u5f15\u8bba\u6587\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u9ad8\u88ab\u5f15\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e\u88ab\u5b8c\u5168\u8bb0\u4f4f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples.

While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u548c1D CNN\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6807\u6ce8\u7b49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u539f\u59cbPSG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5355 epoch \u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c1D CNN\u805a\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e34\u5e8a\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001BMI\uff09\u53ca\u6bcf epoch \u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6807\u6ce8\uff08\u5982\u547c\u5438\u6682\u505c\u3001\u53bb\u9971\u548c\u7b49\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728SHHS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08n=8,357\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528PSG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774\uff09\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5c06macro-F1\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.8031\uff0cmicro-F1\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.9051\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6ce8\u91ca\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff1b\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u6539PSG\u5bfc\u8054\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d34\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u8bfb\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We propose a paradigm shift from \"model training\" to \"model raising\", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate.

Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view. These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing.

We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \\$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6587\u6863\u5e03\u5c40\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u65b9\u5dee\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u6863\u5e03\u5c40\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982LLM\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaOCR-LLM\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u63a8\u65ad\u6587\u6863\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801LLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75285%\u6807\u7b7e\u7684PubLayNet\u4e0a\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SwiftFormer\u8fbe\u523088.2 AP\uff0cLayoutLMv3\u8fbe\u523089.7 AP\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5ab2\u7f8e\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684UDOP\uff1bLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u6d88\u6b67\uff08+3.8 AP\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u63d0\u53470.9 AP\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edcCovariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8c31\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u751f\u6210\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u5ab2\u7f8ePCA\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "PCA\u5728\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u4e14\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u8c31\u4e2d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1CSTs\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5c0f\u6ce2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u56fe\u4e0a\u9010\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u526a\u679d\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eCSTs\u5bf9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u63a5\u8fd1\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u4e8ePCA\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u57284\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "CSTs\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86PCA\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7279\u6027\u4e0eVNNs\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising.

This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality.

However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge.

Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.\n  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.\n  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.\n  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u969c\u788d\u8bc1\u4e66\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b100\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5BarrierBench\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u969c\u788d\u8bc1\u4e66\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u5e76\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5019\u9009\u969c\u788d\u8bc1\u4e66\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0eSMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u969c\u788d\u8bc1\u4e66\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5408\u6210\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684Benchmark\u2014\u2014BarrierBench\u3002", "result": "\u5728BarrierBench\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u969c\u788d\u8bc1\u4e66\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u4e14\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u7684BarrierBench\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u878d\u5408\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning.

In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEVADE\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u65ad\uff08NLI\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9NLP\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u53d8\u5f02\uff08HLV\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e24\u8f6e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEVADE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6807\u6ce8\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u5f71\u54cd\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5254\u9664\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u53bb\u9664\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u5de5\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.", "AI": {"tldr": "HitoMi-Cam\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u8c31\u53cd\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4eba\u5458\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u6551\u63f4\u7b49\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u672a\u5305\u542b\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u707e\u96be\u6551\u63f4\uff09\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHitoMi-Cam\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8863\u7269\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u53cd\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5458\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0GPU\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8623.2 fps\u7684\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff08253x190\u50cf\u7d20\uff09\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u641c\u6551\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08AP\uff09\u8fbe\u523093.5%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73CNN\u6a21\u578b\u768453.8%\uff0c\u4e14\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "HitoMi-Cam\u5e76\u975e\u65e8\u5728\u53d6\u4ee3CNN\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u53d8\u5316\u591a\u7aef\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u707e\u5bb3\u6551\u63f4\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3aCNN\u7684\u6709\u529b\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eba\u5458\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework.

We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e862025\u5e74\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728PDDL\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT-5\u5728\u6807\u51c6PDDL\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u89c4\u5212\u5668LAMA\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff1b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u88ab\u6df7\u6dc6\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7eaf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u6709LLM\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u9000\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8f83\u4e4b\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u6709\u6240\u51cf\u8f7b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u76f8\u6bd4\u524d\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f53\u524d\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684PDDL\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528PDDL\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u793aDeepSeek R1\u3001Gemini 2.5 Pro\u3001GPT-5\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u89c4\u5212\u5668LAMA\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u89c4\u5212\u7ade\u8d5b\u5b66\u4e60\u8d5b\u9053\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6PDDL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGPT-5\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eLAMA\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u6709LLM\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4f46\u964d\u5e45\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u544a\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fGPT-5\uff09\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5df2\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u4e1a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the \"imagined\" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-robot settings demonstrate that WMPO (i) substantially improves sample efficiency, (ii) achieves stronger overall performance, (iii) exhibits emergent behaviors such as self-correction, and (iv) demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c(VLA)\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u793a\u8303\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u5931\u8d25\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u80fd\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWMPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u800c\u975e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u2018\u60f3\u8c61\u2019\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VLA\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u6267\u884cGRPO\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cWMPO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u81ea\u7ea0\u6b63\u7b49\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "WMPO\u4e3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning.

However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMAP-VLA\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u4e14\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5373\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "MAP-VLA\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5355\u5143\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5339\u914d\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5165VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMAP-VLA\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u4e867.0%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e8625.0%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MAP-VLA\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u3002"}}

However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u65f6\u5e8f\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77ed\u65f6\u3001\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u65e0\u504f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u60c5\u7eea\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7328\u4e2a\u60c5\u611f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c1152\u4e2a\u5e72\u6270\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u57fa\u7ebf\u60c5\u7eea\u6c34\u5e73\uff08BEL\uff09\u3001\u60c5\u7eea\u8f68\u8ff9\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\uff08ETV\uff09\u548c\u60c5\u7eea\u8d28\u5fc3\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08ECP\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u652f\u6301\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5177\u5fc3\u7406\u4f9d\u636e\u7684AI\u60c5\u611f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Chawla"], "title": "CrochetBench: Can Vision-Language Models Move from Describing to Doing in Crochet Domain?", "comment": "code available at https://github.com/Peiyu-Georgia-Li/crochetBench", "summary": "We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations.

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins.

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDIVO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u52a8\u4f5c\u65bd\u52a0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIVO\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u6f5c\u529b\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5e7f\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDIVO\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u5747\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684AntMaze\u9886\u57df\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DIVO\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.

While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments.

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience.

The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408CTC/Attention\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u5757\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b89\u591a\u65b9\u8a00\u85cf\u8bed\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5757\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u8bcd\u5178\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fa\u5b9a\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u591a\u65b9\u8a00\u85cf\u8bed\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u8bed\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408CTC/Attention\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5757\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5757\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u85cf\u6587\u6b63\u5b57\u6cd5\u7684\u8bcd\u5178\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u5355\u5143\uff1b\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u878d\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52306.23%\u7684\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff08WER\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u5757\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e48.15%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bc6\u522b\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5757\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u85cf\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u901f\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively.

By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\\%--1\\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aQIBONN\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\u3001\u8c03\u53c2\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0e\u53d7\u5168\u5c40\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7a81\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQIBONN\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8c03\u53c2\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6811\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u5f0fHPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684IBM-Q\u540e\u7aef\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "QIBONN\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors.

In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS.

While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65e5\u672c\u5373\u5174\u559c\u5267Oogiri\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4ef7\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u5171\u60c5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\u66f4\u91cd\u89c6\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6240\u91cd\u89c6\u7684\u5171\u60c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7d\u9ed8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u2018\u662f\u5426\u597d\u7b11\u2019\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e7d\u9ed8\u591a\u9762\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Oogiri\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u65b0\u6765\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u667a\u529b\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u597d\u7b11\u7a0b\u5ea6\u516d\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76845\u70b9\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684Oogiri\u56de\u7b54\u6c34\u5e73\u4ecb\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5230\u4e2d\u7b49\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5171\u60c5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1bLLM\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u56de\u7b54\u65f6\u66f4\u770b\u91cd\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u66f4\u770b\u91cd\u5171\u60c5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e24\u8005\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLM\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u60c5\u800c\u5728\u5e7d\u9ed8\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u91ca\u653e\u6807\u6ce8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5177\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c6a\u65af\u591a\u592b\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08HD\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08FGM\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "FGM\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684HD\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4bHD\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8eHD\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u8c03\u52a8\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528HD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u539f\u59cbFGM\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0FGM-HD\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u4e8639%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5c06HD\u5f15\u5165FGM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3aFGM\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6AuthSig\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7b7e\u540d\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u4e00\u6b21\u4e00\u7528\u201d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9759\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u7b7e\u540d\u56e0\u4fbf\u6377\u800c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6613\u88ab\u590d\u5236\u548c\u6ee5\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u8282\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u7b7e\u540d\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "AuthSig\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u57df\u5931\u771f\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7b7e\u540d\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc798%\uff0c\u5728\u6253\u5370-\u626b\u63cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "AuthSig\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u853d\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u5411\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7eb8less\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\\times$ on average.

We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing.

However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale.

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection.

BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBRIDGE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6570\u636e\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u7528\u5148\u524dAI\u6a21\u578b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u533b\u5b66AI\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff08RCTs\uff09\u867d\u662f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u533b\u5b66AI\u5de5\u5177\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ad8\u6602\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6f2b\u957f\u5468\u671f\u96be\u4ee5\u8ddf\u4e0aAI\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u6b65\u4f10\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBRIDGE\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u5b8c\u6210\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u65e7AI\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u540e\u7eed\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6240\u9700\u5165\u7ec4\u4eba\u6570\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u3001\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u548c\u8113\u6bd2\u75c7\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fde\u7eedAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe64.8%\uff1b\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u7b5b\u67e5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0cBRIDGE\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1146.6%\u7684\u5165\u7ec4\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u8d85280\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630180%\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "BRIDGE\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u590d\u7528\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u6b21AI\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u90fd\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u7ea7\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8AI\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8f6c\u5316\u3002"}}

However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\\%).

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u9879\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53d7\u4f3d\u9a6c\u5206\u5e03\u4e58\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u573a\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u5377\u79ef\u9608\u503c\u6cd5\uff08ICTM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408I-\u6563\u5ea6\u9879\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5168\u53d8\u5dee\uff08TV\uff09\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7070\u5ea6\u6307\u793a\u5668\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u573a\u4ee5\u6821\u6b63\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u793a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u677e\u5f1b\u4fee\u6b63\u6807\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\uff08RMSAV\uff09\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5982\u4f3d\u9a6c\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e58\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u53ca\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94TV\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u573a\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3002"}}

A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow.

Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained.

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts.

However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAnchor\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8d1f\u5956\u52b1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5224\u65ad\u524d\u63d0\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u2018\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u2019\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684rollout\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGRPO\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff1bAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u6f14\u7ece\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cAnchor\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bda\u5b9e\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common \"ghosting effect.\" It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures.

However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236Geodesic Aggregation\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u90bb\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u4e2d\u56e0\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u5c40\u90e8PCA\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u90bb\u57df\u805a\u5408\u4f1a\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5f15\u8d77\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8PCA\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Geodesic Aggregation\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u6cbf\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7403\u9762\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u6d41\u5f62\u63d2\u503c\u6784\u5efaGeoGNN\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0b\uff0cGeoGNN\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a consistently \u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6d41\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5f2f\u66f2\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u6d41\u5f62\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1bGeodesic Aggregation\u548cGeoGNN\u4e3aGNN\u5728\u975e\u6b27\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification.

Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis.

However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aC$^3$TG\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5c5e\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "method": "C$^3$TG\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574token\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f97\u5206\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cC$^3$TG\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6bd2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "C$^3$TG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\uff08GLP\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3b\u5e72\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u903c\u771f\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u57df\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0cPAN\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes.

Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions.

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL.

For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \\(l_1\\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent.

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks.

However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead.

Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)", "summary": "We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5FedPM\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5b50\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5b50\u6f02\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5c40\u90e8\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5b50\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eFedPM\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u5355\u6b65\u5c40\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FedPM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5b50\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u662f\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization.

While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728RLHF/DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u6bd2\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fRLHF/DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u6bd2\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RLHF/DPO\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u4f4e\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPIFF\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d2a\u6c34\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u6c34\u6587\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u5236\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d2a\u6c34\u5236\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u822a\u62cd\u6444\u5f71\uff09\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d2a\u6c34\u54cd\u5e94\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PIFF\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff08DEM\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u6d2a\u6c34\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5316\u6df9\u6ca1\u6a21\u578b\uff08SPM\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u964d\u96e8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u6349\u964d\u6c34\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u53f0\u535726\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u533a\u57df\u7684182\u79cd\u964d\u96e8\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cPIFF\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "PIFF\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u6d2a\u707e\u5e94\u5bf9\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To be published in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)", "summary": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTERLA\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u6216\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TERLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8ePPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CAGE Challenge 4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "TERLA\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TERLA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u9632\u5fa1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \\Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies.

In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\u00e9rn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5177\u4f53\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5373\u53ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6781\u503c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u5e38\u7528\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u540e\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u6216\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u671f\u671b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\uff08chaining-based\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u671f\u671b\u6781\u503c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982RBF\u548cMat\u00e9rn\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u907f\u514d\u89e3\u6790\u677e\u5f1b\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u503c\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5212\u5206\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5AMaPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u8ddd\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u8fb9\u8ddd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u6b20\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u62df\u5408-\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAMaPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Z-normalization\u548c\u6307\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u68af\u5ea6\uff1a\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9519\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u5e8f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAMaPO\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u6b20\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "AMaPO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u8ddd\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u5931\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque.

It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation.

Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations.

However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408DermBench\u548cDermEval\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u56fe\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b4000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\u7684DermBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668DermEval\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6279\u8bc4\u548c\u6253\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDermBench\u548cDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task.

Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDFDT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001MMD\u9519\u914d\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u62fc\u63a5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6807\u8bb0\u548cQ\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u6807\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u6e90\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u56de\u62a5\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "DFDT\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u6e90\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001MMD\u5bf9\u9f50\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3001OT\u4fdd\u8bc1\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u878d\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u52a0\u6743\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6807\u8bb0\u66ff\u4ee3RTG\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Q\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6291\u5236\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u98ce\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDFDT\u5728\u91cd\u529b\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56de\u62a5\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u8bb0\u62fc\u63a5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DFDT\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u62fc\u63a5\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u53d7MMD\u9519\u914d\u548cOT\u504f\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u51cf\u5c0f\u5219\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6S-IB\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684Vector-Jacobian\u79ef\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u524d\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u7684Vector-Jacobian\u79ef\uff08VJP\uff09\u6784\u6210\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7f16\u7801-\u89e3\u7801\u89c6\u89d2\uff1a\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7f16\u7801\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u7c7b\u522b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0cVJP\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u5c06\u5176\u89e3\u7801\u56de\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff08S-IB\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u524d\u666f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cS-IB\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u524d\u666f\u805a\u7126\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8c03\u53c2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "S-IB\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316VJP\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas.

However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design.

HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors.

To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as \"Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:\", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982DetectRL\uff09\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4f9d\u8d56\u6377\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6613\u53d7\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9DetectRL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6e05\u6d17\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u660e\u663e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u56fa\u5b9a\u5f00\u5934\u8bed\u53e5\u6216\u62d2\u7edd\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6377\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9DetectRL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u9879\u6e05\u6d17\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53bb\u9664\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6216\u62d2\u7edd\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6d88\u9664AI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5e72\u51c0\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6e05\u6d17\u524d\u540e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6e05\u6d17\u540e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u66f4\u96be\u88ab\u76f4\u63a5\u6b3a\u9a97\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u518d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9AI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6377\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6e05\u6d17\u7248\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality.

However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors.

Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process.

We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one.

In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFQ-PETR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u578b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728W8A8\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "PETR\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d23D\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFQ-PETR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684LiDAR-ray\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff08QFPE\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u951a\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u6d88\u9664\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff08DULUT\uff09\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u91cf\u5316\uff08QANS\uff09\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5931\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdPETR\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0W8A8\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4ec5\u7ea61%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u9ad8\u964d\u4f4e75%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684PTQ\u548cQAT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FQ-PETR\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u91cf\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eFeynman-Kac\uff08FK\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5982\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u671d\u7279\u5b9a\u751f\u5316\u6216\u529f\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u7ec4\u6210\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Feynman-Kac\uff08FK\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5229\u7528ProteinMPNN\u548c\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u86cb\u767d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0cFK\u5f15\u5bfc\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9776\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "FK\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u4efb\u610f\u3001\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features.

To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\\texttt{$\\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\\textbf{F}$lexib$\\textbf{L}$e neighb$\\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\\% of the seen data.

This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency.

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u548cCT\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8eab\u4f53\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u672f\u4e2d\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5c16\u7aef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u7aa5\u955cRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0eCT\u6e32\u67d3\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a2.65 mm\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.19 rad\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates.

Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets.

Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Huber"], "title": "Efficiently Transforming Neural Networks into Decision Trees: A Path to Ground Truth Explanations with RENTT", "comment": null, "summary": "Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP.

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5f3a\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60ViT\u4e0eCNN\u6559\u5e08\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMDB51\u3001EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u548cKinetics-400\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cHMDB51\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53475.95%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u4e0e\u540c\u6784\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\\%-3\\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5f20\u91cf\u7535\u8def\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08TCNN\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u6570\u57df\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u5c42\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad82%-3%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u7535\u8def\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08TCNN\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6570\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u7535\u8def\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u5c42\u6574\u5408\u5b9e\u90e8\u4e0e\u865a\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "TCNN\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u9ad82%-3%\uff1b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u53c2\u6570\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5176\u9632\u6b62\u68af\u5ea6\u7206\u70b8\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5728\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u548cCPU\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "TCNN\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Zelek"], "title": "DreamPose3D: Hallucinative Diffusion with Prompt Learning for 3D Human Pose Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism.

However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM.

However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability.

To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6AdaCuRL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u96be\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u9965\u997f\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u96be\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u9965\u997f\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u6216\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaCuRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u6570\u636e\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u8bbf\u673a\u5236\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u7a00\u758fKL\u7b56\u7565\u9632\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\u9000\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAdaCuRL\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaCuRL\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u96be\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the \"tunable knobs\" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast.

WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.\n  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.\n  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "WOODELF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684SHAP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u80fd\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u79cdSHAP\u53d8\u4f53\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u6e38\u620f\u7406\u8bba\u503c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u80cc\u666fSHAP\u8017\u65f6\u8f83\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "WOODELF\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u3001\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97Background SHAP\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u6269\u5c55\u503c\uff08\u5982Path-Dependent SHAP\u3001Shapley/Banzhaf\u4ea4\u4e92\u503c\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728300\u4e07\u884c\u3001127\u7279\u5f81\u548c500\u4e07\u80cc\u666f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cWOODELF\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u7528162\u79d2\u3001GPU\u4e0a\u4ec516\u79d2\u5b8c\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u901f16\u500d\u548c165\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "WOODELF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u591a\u79cd\u6e38\u620f\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u503c\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport.

In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area.

This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples.

Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6PTE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b-\u7f16\u8f91\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u5220\u9664\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9700\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5b64\u5c9b\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b-\u7f16\u8f91\uff08Probing then Editing, PTE\uff09\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u90bb\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u9884\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u63a8-\u62c9\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u5206\u652f\u5229\u7528\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\u4e3b\u52a8\u74e6\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u62c9\u5206\u652f\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u951a\u5b9a\u56de\u539f\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPTE\u5728CWRU\u3001SCUT-FD\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "PTE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5220\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7b49\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9694\u79bb\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness.

We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated.

As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684SEP\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b341\u4e2aSEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u4e2a\u592a\u9633\u5468\u671f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86SEP\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e2e\u52a9\u592a\u9633\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6210\u56e0\u3002"}}

Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions.

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios.

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition.

A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently.

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GenePheno\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u56e0\u6572\u9664\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u6574\u7406\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5730\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGenePheno\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u6355\u6349\u8868\u578b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6392\u4ed6\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u5c42\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGenePheno\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u4e2d\u5fc3Fmax\u548c\u8868\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3AUC\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "GenePheno\u4e3a\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u57fa\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u8868\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u57df\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684Tsetlin\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7d2f\u79ef\u673a\u5236\u548c\u80dc\u8005\u4e3a\u738b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7b97\u672f\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u57df\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7d2f\u79ef\u673a\u5236\u66ff\u4ee3\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7b97\u672f\u6c42\u548c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u80dc\u8005\u4e3a\u738b\u65b9\u6848\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5e45\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8f83\u5668\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u7c7bTset\u6797\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c49\u660e\u8ddd\u79bb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u524d\u5bfc1\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u538b\u7f29\u65f6\u57df\u65b9\u6848\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u5e76\u7684TMs\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u7b49\u6548\u7684\u6570\u5b57TM\u67b6\u6784\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86Tsetlin\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \\textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "SiDGen\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u63a9\u7801SMILES\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6298\u53e0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53e3\u888b\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ffd\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u5408\u53e3\u888b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSiDGen\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u86cb\u767d\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a9\u7801SMILES\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u6298\u53e0\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u5f84\uff1a\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u805a\u5408\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u7f6e\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7c97\u6b65\u957f\u6298\u53e0\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u65e0\u6548\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a\u53ca\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7f16\u8bd1\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSiDGen\u751f\u6210\u7684\u914d\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u63a5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SiDGen\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5316\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53e3\u888b\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}
