However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who\" and ``what\" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPC2P\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u3001\u672c\u5730\u4eba\u7fa4\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u5316\u6b7b\u9501\u7834\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff08MAPF\uff09\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMAPF\u4e0eMARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u6b7b\u9501\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eQ-learning\u7684MARL\u6846\u67b6PC2P\uff1a1\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u62d3\u6251\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u9009\u62e9-\u751f\u6210-\u805a\u5408\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u878d\u5408\u9759\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u672c\u5730\u4eba\u7fa4\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5316\u6b7b\u9501\u7834\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "PC2P\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMAPF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "PC2P\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u6b7b\u9501\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMAPF\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility. However, findings also reinforce limitations documented in the literature, including variability in LLM behaviour that leads to challenges in transitioning from prototype to production maturity.

However, traditional human-dependent chromatographic process development faces challenges such as reliance on expert experience, long development cycles, and labor intensity. ChromR, a large language model (LLM)-driven platform for chromatographic process design and optimization, is presented in this work. The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased. Chromatographic purification of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf (EGBL) was selected as a case study.

While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u4fe1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\uff09\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u535a\u5f08\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u52a8\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u6216\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u6027\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6216\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u534f\u8c03\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u535a\u5f08\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u4e09\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4eba\u683c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u4e0e\u91cd\u590d\u535a\u5f08\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u9690\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5bf9\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u5728LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u81ea\u53d1\u6d8c\u73b0\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance.

We start with an intrinsic Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration technique, which, when coupled with texture, tends to produce over-smoothed renders. To address this, we resort to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has recently been shown to produce realistic free-viewpoint avatars. Given a multiview sequence, we extract a FLAME mesh, solve a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and obtain its exaggerated form. However, directly deforming the Gaussians yields poor results, necessitating the synthesis of pseudo-ground-truth caricature images by warping each frame to its exaggerated 2D representation using local affine transformations. We then devise a training scheme that alternates real and synthesized supervision, enabling a single Gaussian collection to represent both natural and exaggerated avatars. This scheme improves fidelity, supports local edits, and allows continuous control over the intensity of the caricature. In order to achieve real-time deformations, an efficient interpolation between the original and exaggerated surfaces is introduced. We further analyze and show that it has a bounded deviation from closed-form solutions. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our results outperform prior work, delivering photorealistic, geometry-controlled caricature avatars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u9635\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u4e14\u903c\u771f\u76843D\u4eba\u8138\u6f2b\u753b\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u6cca\u677e\u53d8\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u5938\u5f20\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4ea4\u66ff\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6f2b\u753b\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u9762\u66f2\u7387\u5938\u5f20\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u6e32\u67d3\u65f6\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\uff1b\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u5938\u5f20\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6e32\u67d3\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u66f2\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u9762\u5938\u5f20\uff1b2\uff09\u7528FLAME\u62df\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u6c42\u89e3\u66f2\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u6cca\u677e\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f97\u5230\u5938\u5f20\u7f51\u683c\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u771f\u503c\u6f2b\u753b\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b4\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4ea4\u66ff\u76d1\u7763\u76843DGS\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b5\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u6548\u63d2\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u76843D\u6f2b\u753b\u5934\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u5938\u5f20\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6f2b\u753b\u5316\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u534f\u540c\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u53163D\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6536\u655b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c2\u6d4b\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u611f\u77e5\u8303\u56f4\u4e0e\u4ec5\u65b9\u4f4d\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6536\u655b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1VariAntNet\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eBellaiche-Bruckstein\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff1b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u56f0\u96be\u6784\u578b\u4e0b\u6210\u4e3a\u552f\u4e00\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5316\u89c2\u6d4b\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d7\u9650\u4f20\u611f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Such vehicles must be able to navigate precisely in safe regions to avoid natural hazards, human-constructed infrastructure, and dangerous dark shadows. Rovers must be able to park their cargo autonomously within a small tolerance to achieve a successful pickup and delivery. In this field test, Lidar Teach and Repeat provides an ideal autonomy solution for transporting cargo in this way. A one-tonne path-to-flight rover was driven in a semi-autonomous remote-control mode to create a network of safe paths. Once the route was taught, the rover immediately repeated the entire network of paths autonomously while carrying cargo.

However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called \"Red Queen\" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDigital Red Queen\uff08DRQ\uff09\u7684LLM\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u6f14\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Core War\u8fd9\u4e00\u56fe\u7075\u5b8c\u5907\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u6f14\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08warriors\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u2018\u7ea2\u7687\u540e\u2019\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5411\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u771f\u5b9e\u8fdb\u5316\u4e2d\u5f00\u653e\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u2018\u7ea2\u7687\u540e\u2019\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDRQ\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528LLM\u5728Core War\u865a\u62df\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f6e\u6f14\u5316\u51fa\u80fd\u51fb\u8d25\u6240\u6709\u5386\u53f2warrior\u7684\u65b0warrior\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u5bf9\u6297\u7684\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u6f14\u5316\u94fe\u3002", "result": "warrior\u968f\u8f6e\u6b21\u589e\u52a0\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1warrior\u7684\u80dc\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8de8\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u6536\u655b\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u81ea\u7136\u754c\u7684\u8d8b\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u7ea2\u7687\u540e\u76ee\u6807\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u66f4\u5229\u4e8e\u6fc0\u53d1LLM\u6f14\u5316\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u7b56\u7565\uff1bCore War\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u6c99\u76d2\uff0cDRQ\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e5f\u6697\u793a\u5176\u53ef\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6297\u836f\u6027\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting.

If errors arise during task execution, the approach also uses an LLM to adjust the BTs on-the-fly in a refinement loop. Experimental validation in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in improving overall task performance compared to alternative approaches that leverage task-specific knowledge.

Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5c06\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u5199\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u8fdd\u53cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u54cd\u5e94\u9a8c\u6536\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u4e3a\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u5199\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama 3.1 8B\u548cMixtral-8x 7B\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4fee\u8ba2\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u9075\u5faa\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5bf9\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9075\u5b88\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b-\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7ec4\u8054\u5408\u6291\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165SuPLoRA\u6280\u672f\u5728\u64e6\u9664\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u64e6\u9664\u591a\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u635f\u5bb3\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u534f\u540c\u64e6\u9664\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b-\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u6982\u5ff5\u805a\u7c7b\u5230\u540c\u4e00\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec4\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u64e6\u9664\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u4e00\u7ec4\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fdd\u7559\u672a\u63a9\u7801\u533a\u57df\u53bb\u566a\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation\uff08SuPLoRA\uff09\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e0b\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0a\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\uff08\u540d\u4eba\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u8272\u60c5\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u540c\u6b65\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSuPLoRA\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u64e6\u9664\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8d85\u7c7b\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u5206\u7ec4\u64e6\u9664\u6846\u67b6\u53caSuPLoRA\u9002\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u64e6\u9664\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Though the scaling law has been validated for sequential models, it showed inefficiency in computational capacity when considering real-world applications like recommendation, due to the non-linear(quadratic) increasing nature of the transformer model. To improve the efficiency of the sequential model, we introduced a novel approach to sequential recommendation that leverages personalization techniques to enhance efficiency and performance. Our method compresses long user interaction histories into learnable tokens, which are then combined with recent interactions to generate recommendations. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high recommendation accuracy.

Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5.

This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities.

This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning.

In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

Existing UAV navigation approaches rely on simplified simulators and supervised perception pipelines, and lack embodied agents interacting with physically realistic fire environments. We introduce FIRE-VLM, the first end-to-end vision-language model (VLM) guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework trained entirely within a high-fidelity, physics-grounded wildfire digital twin. Built from USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM) terrain, LANDFIRE fuel inventories, and semi-physical fire-spread solvers, this twin captures terrain-induced runs, wind-driven acceleration, smoke plume occlusion, and dynamic fuel consumption. Within this environment, a PPO agent with dual-view UAV sensing is guided by a CLIP-style VLM. Wildfire-specific semantic alignment scores, derived from a single prompt describing active fire and smoke plumes, are integrated as potential-based reward shaping signals. Our contributions are: (1) a GIS-to-simulation pipeline for constructing wildfire digital twins; (2) a VLM-guided RL agent for UAV firefront tracking; and (3) a wildfire-aware reward design that combines physical terms with VLM semantics. Across five digital-twin evaluation tasks, our VLM-guided policy reduces time-to-detection by up to 6 times, increases time-in-FOV, and is, to our knowledge, the first RL-based UAV wildfire monitoring system demonstrated in kilometer-scale, physics-grounded digital-twin fires.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FIRE-VLM\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91ce\u706b\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u81ea\u4e3b\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08GIS\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u3001VLM\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684PPO\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u706b\u7ebf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u91ce\u706b\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5316\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u706b\u707e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u8eab\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eUSGS DEM\u5730\u5f62\u3001LANDFIRE\u71c3\u6599\u6570\u636e\u548c\u534a\u7269\u7406\u706b\u8513\u5ef6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91ce\u706b\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff1b\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u7684PPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u7531CLIP\u98ce\u683cVLM\u63d0\u4f9b wildfire-specific \u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cVLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u706b\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u591a\u7f29\u77ed6\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u89c6\u91ce\u5185\u65f6\u957f\uff1b\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u5343\u7c73\u7ea7\u3001\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u91ce\u706b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684RL\u9a71\u52a8UAV\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "FIRE-VLM\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86VLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684RL\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u707e\u5bb3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u3001\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91ce\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address this gap, this paper proposes the STELLA (Self-Reflective TErminoLogy-Aware Framework for BuiLding an Aerospace Information Retrieval Benchmark) framework. Using this framework, we introduce the STELLA benchmark, an aerospace-specific IR evaluation set constructed from NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) documents via a systematic pipeline that comprises document layout detection, passage chunking, terminology dictionary construction, synthetic query generation, and cross-lingual extension. The framework generates two types of queries: the Terminology Concordant Query (TCQ), which includes the terminology verbatim to evaluate lexical matching, and the Terminology Agnostic Query (TAQ), which utilizes the terminology's description to assess semantic matching. This enables a disentangled evaluation of the lexical and semantic matching capabilities of embedding models. In addition, we combine Chain-of-Density (CoD) and the Self-Reflection method with query generation to improve quality and implement a hybrid cross-lingual extension that reflects real user querying practices. Evaluation of seven embedding models on the STELLA benchmark shows that large decoder-based embedding models exhibit the strongest semantic understanding, while lexical matching methods such as BM25 remain highly competitive in domains where exact lexical matching technical term is crucial. The STELLA benchmark provides a reproducible foundation for reliable performance evaluation and improvement of embedding models in aerospace-domain IR tasks.

smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.\n  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.\n  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPT-5 \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5199\u4f5c\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u524d\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u591a\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u5dee\u3001\u6613\u8c04\u5a9a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u5bf9\u751f\u7269/\u5316\u5b66\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6ee5\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u6a21\u5757\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08gpt-5-main\u3001gpt-5-thinking\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u8def\u7531\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165safe-completions\u5b89\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u636ePreparedness Framework\u5bf9\u9ad8\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u65bd\u524d\u7f6e\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u524d\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e0e\u6297\u8c04\u5a9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5199\u4f5c\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u4e09\u5927\u9ad8\u9891\u573a\u666f\u6027\u80fd\u8dc3\u5347\uff1bgpt-5-thinking\u88ab\u5217\u4e3a\u751f\u7269/\u5316\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u542f\u7528\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "GPT-5\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u9884\u5907\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest.

However, traditional approaches exhibit limited adaptability in dynamic environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes OFF-EMMA, a novel end-to-end multimodal framework designed to overcome the deficiencies of insufficient spatial perception and unstable reasoning in visual-language-action (VLA) models for off-road autonomous driving scenarios. The framework explicitly annotates input images through the design of a visual prompt block and introduces a chain-of-thought with self-consistency (COT-SC) reasoning strategy to enhance the accuracy and robustness of trajectory planning. The visual prompt block utilizes semantic segmentation masks as visual prompts, enhancing the spatial understanding ability of pre-trained visual-language models for complex terrains. The COT- SC strategy effectively mitigates the error impact of outliers on planning performance through a multi-path reasoning mechanism. Experimental results on the RELLIS-3D off-road dataset demonstrate that OFF-EMMA significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing the average L2 error of the Qwen backbone model by 13.3% and decreasing the failure rate from 16.52% to 6.56%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOFF-EMMA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08COT-SC\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8d8a\u91ce\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d8a\u91ce\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u548c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08COT-SC\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u6291\u5236\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728RELLIS-3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfQwen\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747L2\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e13.3%\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u4ece16.52%\u964d\u81f36.56%\u3002", "conclusion": "OFF-EMMA\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d8a\u91ce\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike prior RLHF-based recommender methods that directly optimize item rankings, our two-tower architecture keeps the recommender's ranking model intact while a language model learns to produce helpful explanations. We design a composite reward signal combining explanation length, content relevance, and coherence, and apply proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a KL-divergence constraint to fine-tune a large language model with only 0.4% of its parameters trainable via LoRA adapters. In experiments on an Amazon Books dataset (approximately 50K interactions in the fantasy and romance genres), Shielded RecRL improved the relative click-through rate (CTR) by 22.5% (1.225x over baseline) while keeping the recommender's item-ranking behavior virtually unchanged.

Small Language Models (SLMs) -- defined here as models under 10B parameters -- typically score 3-4 times lower than LLMs on these metrics. However, we demonstrate that these evaluations fail to capture SLMs' effectiveness in common industrial applications, such as tone modification tasks (e.g., funny, serious, professional). We propose an evaluation framework specifically designed to highlight SLMs' capabilities in non-reasoning tasks where predefined evaluation datasets don't exist. Our framework combines novel approaches in data generation, prompt-tuning, and LLM-based evaluation to demonstrate the potential of task-specific finetuning.

Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).\n  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.\n  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCPGPrompt\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u53d9\u4e8b\u6027\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5357\uff08CPGs\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347AI\u5bf9\u6307\u5357\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u8bca\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff08F1\u8fbe0.85\u20131.00\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u56e0\u6307\u5357\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684CPG\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u6307\u5357\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u9002\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7a84\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684AI\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCPGPrompt\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u53d9\u4e8b\u6027CPGs\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528LLM\u52a8\u6001\u904d\u5386\u8be5\u6811\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u60a3\u8005\u75c5\u4f8b\uff1b\u5728\u5934\u75db\u3001\u8170\u75db\u548c\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u75c5\u4f8b vignettes\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u56db\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u8bca\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u591a\u7c7b\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e13\u79d1\u8f6c\u8bca\u4efb\u52a1F1\u8fbe0.85\u20131.00\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6052\u4e3a1.00\uff1b\u591a\u7c7b\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u914dF1\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u5934\u75db0.47\u3001\u8170\u75db0.72\u3001\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c0.77\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u5404\u6307\u5357\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff1a\u5934\u75db\u6307\u5357\u53d7\u5426\u5b9a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u8170\u75db\u9700\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u56e0\u91cf\u5316\u68c0\u9a8c\u6307\u6807\u800c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "CPGPrompt\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5bf9CPGs\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u8f6c\u8bca\u5224\u65ad\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u9700\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Performance of string instruments, such as violin and cello, presents a significant challenge due to the precise control required over bow angle and pressure to produce the desired sound. While prior robotic cellists focus on accurate bowing trajectories, these works often rely on expensive motion capture techniques, and fail to sightread music in a human-like way.\n  We propose a novel end-to-end MIDI score to robotic motion pipeline which converts musical input directly into collision-aware bowing motions for a UR5e robot cellist. Through use of Universal Robot Freedrive feature, our robotic musician can achieve human-like sound without the need for motion capture. Additionally, this work records live joint data via Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE) as the robot plays, providing labeled robotic playing data from a collection of five standard pieces to the research community. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to human performers, we introduce the Musical Turing Test, in which a collection of 132 human participants evaluate our robot's performance against a human baseline. Human reference recordings are also released, enabling direct comparison for future studies. This evaluation technique establishes the first benchmark for robotic cello performance. Finally, we outline a residual reinforcement learning methodology to improve upon baseline robotic controls, highlighting future opportunities for improved string-crossing efficiency and sound quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684MIDI\u4e50\u8c31\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eUR5e\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u6f14\u594f\u5927\u63d0\u7434\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u97f3\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u63d0\u7434\u6f14\u594f\u7684\u2018\u97f3\u4e50\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u2019\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u6e90\u6f14\u594f\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u8003\u5f55\u97f3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u594f\u5927\u63d0\u7434\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u89c6\u594f\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5ba2\u89c2\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u9700\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7c7b\u4eba\u6f14\u594f\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eUR5e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684Freedrive\u529f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u529b\u63a7\u5f13\u6cd5\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u6784\u5efaMIDI\u2192\u78b0\u649e\u611f\u77e5\u5f13\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b\u5229\u7528RTDE\u5b9e\u65f6\u91c7\u96c6\u5173\u8282\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542b132\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e94\u9996\u6807\u51c6\u66f2\u76ee\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6f14\u594f\uff1b\u5f00\u6e90\u771f\u5b9e\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u594f\u5f55\u97f3\uff1b\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u53ef\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6b8b\u5deeRL\u5728\u5f26\u5207\u6362\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u97f3\u8d28\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f26\u4e50\u6f14\u594f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u6240\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u5177\u8eab\u97f3\u4e50\u667a\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

At the same time, little attention has been paid to query suggestions in this regard. Awareness of the problem of biased query suggestions has been raised. Likewise, there is a rising need for automatic bias detection approaches. This paper adds on the bias detection pipeline for bias detection in query suggestions of person-related search developed by Bonart et al. \\cite{Bonart_2019a}. The sparseness and lack of contextual metadata of query suggestions make them a difficult subject for bias detection. Furthermore, query suggestions are perceived very briefly and subliminally. To overcome these issues, perception-aware metrics are introduced. Consequently, the enhanced pipeline is able to better detect systematic topical bias in search engine query suggestions for person-related searches. The results of an analysis performed with the developed pipeline confirm this assumption. Due to the perception-aware bias detection metrics, findings produced by the pipeline can be assumed to reflect bias that users would discern.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u611f\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u9488\u5bf9\u4eba\u7269\u76f8\u5173\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5efa\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e3b\u9898\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u67e5\u8be2\u5efa\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u8db3\u591f\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u77ed\u6682\u800c\u6f5c\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5728Bonart\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\uff08perception-aware\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e3b\u9898\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u7269\u76f8\u5173\u641c\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u5efa\u8bae\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e3b\u9898\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u7528\u6237\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u77e5\u3002"}}

However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08LFMs\uff09\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u867d\u64c5\u957f\u4ece\u7fa4\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u4f53\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u63d0\u51faLFMs\u4e0eN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5e94\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1-\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316-\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b49\u591a\u91cd\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u771f\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5398\u6e05\u5176\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5f20\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522bAI\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u5927\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bba\u8bc1LFMs\u4e0eN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018LFM\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u5e72\u9884\u2192\u89e6\u53d1N-of-1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u2019\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86LFMs\u4e0d\u80fd\u66ff\u4ee3N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u5e94\u534f\u540c\uff1aLFMs\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0cN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u5c06AI\u878d\u5165\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u5b66\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u6e05\u6670\u533a\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u6765\u8c03\u548c\u5185\u5728\u6096\u8bba\uff1bLFMs\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u4e8e\u8d4b\u80fd\u800c\u975e\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning.

This paper introduces Locomotion Beyond Feet, a comprehensive system for whole-body humanoid locomotion across extremely challenging terrains, including low-clearance spaces under chairs, knee-high walls, knee-high platforms, and steep ascending and descending stairs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: contact-rich motion planning and generalization across diverse terrains. To this end, we combine physics-grounded keyframe animation with reinforcement learning. Keyframes encode human knowledge of motor skills, are embodiment-specific, and can be readily validated in simulation or on hardware, while reinforcement learning transforms these references into robust, physically accurate motions. We further employ a hierarchical framework consisting of terrain-specific motion-tracking policies, failure recovery mechanisms, and a vision-based skill planner.

In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u591a\u7ef4\u5212\u5206\u7684\u5927\u578bRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\uff08DFM\uff09\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u5206\u7247\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6982\u5ff5\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u591a\u7ef4\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u88ab\u96f6\u6563\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u96be\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\uff08DFM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06RAG\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u5212\u5206\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff08\u6587\u672c\u5757\uff09\u3001\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u90e8\u95e8\uff09\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u53d7\u63a7\u56de\u9000\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "DFM\u4f7fRAG\u68c0\u7d22\u4ece\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5f0f\u76f8\u4f3c\u5339\u914d\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5168\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u7136\u652f\u6301\u5c42\u7ea7\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u8def\u7531\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06OLAP\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5efa\u6a21\u601d\u60f3\u5f15\u5165RAG\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0cDFM\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u8be5\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Recent studies have demonstrated that retrieving neighbor sessions to augment the current session can effectively alleviate the data sparsity issue and improve recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically rely on explicitly observed session data, neglecting latent neighbors - not directly observed but potentially relevant within the interest space - thereby failing to fully exploit the potential of neighbor sessions in recommendation. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel model of diffusion-based latent neighbor generation for session-based recommendation, named DiffSBR. Specifically, DiffSBR leverages two diffusion modules, including retrieval-augmented diffusion and self-augmented diffusion, to generate high-quality latent neighbors. In the retrieval-augmented diffusion module, we leverage retrieved neighbors as guiding signals to constrain and reconstruct the distribution of latent neighbors. Meanwhile, we adopt a training strategy that enables the retriever to learn from the feedback provided by the generator. In the self-augmented diffusion module, we explicitly guide the generation of latent neighbors by injecting the current session's multi-modal signals through contrastive learning. After obtaining the generated latent neighbors, we utilize them to enhance session representations for improving session-based recommendation.

However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.\n  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u65e0\u5173\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6X\u5149\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u538b\u7f29\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e90%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57dfLLM\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u6d41\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982tinyBenchmarks\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5168\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u6216\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840LLM\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u6570\u636e\u96c6X\u5149\u2019\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u7c07\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u51c6\u538b\u7f29\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u57283GPP\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5254\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8590%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5168\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u5386\u53f2\u65e0\u5173\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u4e0b\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks.

This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models.

We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points.

While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels.

Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \\textbf{STAR-S} (\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{TA}ught \\textbf{R}easoning based on \\textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training.

However, this co-optimization of body and control is challenging, because controllers need some time to adapt to the evolving morphology - which may make it difficult for new and promising designs to enter the evolving population. A solution to this is to add intra-life learning, defined as an additional controller optimization loop, to each individual in the evolving population. A related problem is the lack of diversity often seen in evolving populations as evolution narrows the search down to a few promising designs too quickly. This problem can be mitigated by implementing full generational replacement, where offspring robots replace the whole population. This solution for increasing diversity usually comes at the cost of lower performance compared to using elitism. In this work, we show that combining such generational replacement with intra-life learning can increase diversity while retaining performance. We also highlight the importance of performance metrics when studying learning in morphologically evolving robots, showing that evaluating according to function evaluations versus according to generations of evolution can give different conclusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e2d\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u9645\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u79cd\u7fa4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30 vs. \u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u6570\uff09\u5bf9\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u56e0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u6ede\u540e\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5165\u79cd\u7fa4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u79cd\u7fa4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\uff08intra-life learning\uff09\u4e0e\u5168\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\uff08full generational replacement\uff09\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u589e\u52a0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u7cbe\u82f1\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79cd\u7fa4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u672a\u727a\u7272\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4e14\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5168\u4ee3\u9645\u66ff\u6362\u53ef\u534f\u540c\u6539\u5584\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5f62\u6001\u8fdb\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a ALERT \u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u5c42\u3001\u9010\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u9010 token \u5730\u653e\u5927\u826f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff08\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u4e0d\u65ad\u6d8c\u73b0\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c42-\u6a21\u5757- token \u4e09\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u653e\u5927\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u5c42\u3001\u5177\u6709\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u53ca\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168 token\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684 ALERT \u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cALERT \u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5747\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5217\u524d\u4e24\u540d\uff1b\u5e73\u5747 Accuracy \u548c F1 \u6bd4\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad8\u81f3\u5c11 10%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe 40%\u3002", "conclusion": "ALERT \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u771f\u6b63\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a LLM \u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Ege de Bruin", "Kyrre Glette", "Kai Olav Ellefsen"], "title": "Integrating Sample Inheritance into Bayesian Optimization for Evolutionary Robotics", "comment": null, "summary": "In evolutionary robotics, robot morphologies are designed automatically using evolutionary algorithms. This creates a body-brain optimization problem, where both morphology and control must be optimized together. A common approach is to include controller optimization for each morphology, but starting from scratch for every new body may require a high controller learning budget. We address this by using Bayesian optimization for controller optimization, exploiting its sample efficiency and strong exploration capabilities, and using sample inheritance as a form of Lamarckian inheritance. Under a deliberately low controller learning budget for each morphology, we investigate two types of sample inheritance: (1) transferring all the parent's samples to the offspring to be used as prior without evaluating them, and (2) reevaluating the parent's best samples on the offspring. Both are compared to a baseline without inheritance. Our results show that reevaluation performs best, with prior-based inheritance also outperforming no inheritance. Analysis reveals that while the learning budget is too low for a single morphology, generational inheritance compensates for this by accumulating learned adaptations across generations. Furthermore, inheritance mainly benefits offspring morphologies that are similar to their parents. Finally, we demonstrate the critical role of the environment, with more challenging environments resulting in more stable walking gaits. Our findings highlight that inheritance mechanisms can boost performance in evolutionary robotics without needing large learning budgets, offering an efficient path toward more capable robot design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u7ee7\u627f\uff08\u62c9\u9a6c\u514b\u5f0f\u9057\u4f20\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f62\u6001-\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u4ece\u5934\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff1b\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u5f80\u5f80\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u6837\u672c\u7ee7\u627f\u673a\u5236\uff1a(1) \u5c06\u7236\u4ee3\u6837\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b(2) \u5728\u5b50\u4ee3\u5f62\u6001\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u7236\u4ee3\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65e0\u7ee7\u627f\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5148\u9a8c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6b21\u4e4b\u4f46\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ee7\u627f\uff1b\u7ee7\u627f\u5c24\u5176\u5229\u4e8e\u4e0e\u7236\u4ee3\u5f62\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5b50\u4ee3\uff1b\u73af\u5883\u6311\u6218\u6027\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u6240\u83b7\u6b65\u6001\u8d8a\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6837\u672c\u7ee7\u627f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8865\u507f\u5355\u4ee3\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u4ee3\u79ef\u7d2f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u8fdb\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator.

While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.\n  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.\n  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCRIBE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6280\u80fd\u539f\u578b\u5e93\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCRIBE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u5c42\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u6280\u80fd\u539f\u578b\u5e93\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5bf9\u5e94\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff1bQwen3-4B\u6a21\u578b\u5728AIME25\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece43.3%\u63d0\u5347\u81f363.3%\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e2d\u5c42\u6280\u80fd\u638c\u63e1\u5148\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\u6d8c\u73b0\uff1bSCRIBE\u53ef\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u5de5\u5177\u4f18\u5316\u534f\u540c\u589e\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "SCRIBE\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u80fd\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on \"appearance-free\" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7315\u7334\u4e0b\u989e\u53f6\uff08IT\uff09\u76ae\u5c42\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u9891\u89c2\u770b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9IT\u795e\u7ecf\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u540e\u671f\u54cd\u5e94\u9636\u6bb5\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709ANN\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u50cfIT\u795e\u7ecf\u7fa4\u4f53\u90a3\u6837\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f46\u53bb\u9664\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u201c\u5916\u89c2\u65e0\u5173\u201d\u89c6\u9891\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u6355\u6349\u5916\u89c2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u975eIT\u4e2d\u4f53\u73b0\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u7315\u7334IT\u76ae\u5c42\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u662f\u5426\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c55\u5f00\u6216\u6d45\u5c42\u65f6\u95f4\u6c60\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u4f53\u73b0\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709ANN\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u8fd9\u79cd\u751f\u7269\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u7315\u7334IT\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u53ca\u89c6\u9891\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u9891\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1\u2018\u5916\u89c2\u65e0\u5173\u2019\u89c6\u9891\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u53bb\u9664\u5f62\u72b6/\u7eb9\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eIT\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5728IT\u54cd\u5e94\u665a\u671f\u5e26\u6765\u5c0f\u5e45\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728\u2018\u5916\u89c2\u65e0\u5173\u2019\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cIT\u795e\u7ecf\u7fa4\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u6240\u6709ANN\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891ANN\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u6355\u6349\u5916\u89c2\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21IT\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u53d8\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u7b26\u5408\u751f\u7269\u65f6\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Existing safeguarding concepts, such as Online Verification (OV), provide safety layers that detect infeasible planning outputs. However, they lack an active mechanism to ensure safe operation in the event that the main planner fails. This paper presents a first step toward an active safety extension for fail-operational Autonomous Driving (AD). We deploy a lightweight sampling-based trajectory planner on an automotive-grade, embedded platform running a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The planner continuously computes trajectories under constrained computational resources, forming the foundation for future emergency planning architectures. Experimental results demonstrate deterministic timing behavior with bounded latency and minimal jitter, validating the feasibility of trajectory planning on safety-certifiable hardware. The study highlights both the potential and the remaining challenges of integrating active fallback mechanisms as an integral part of next-generation safeguarding frameworks.

We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules. Furthermore, we show that the learned rules reveal news consumption patterns, enabling editors to align content curation goals with target audience behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u900f\u660e\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u70b9\u51fb\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MIND\u548cEB-NeRD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u65b0\u95fb\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7f16\u8f91\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7684\u900f\u660e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u9608\u503c\u63a7\u5236\u89c4\u5219\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIND\u548cEB-NeRD\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u51fb\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u95fb\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f16\u8f91\u5c06\u5185\u5bb9\u7b56\u5212\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u53d7\u4f17\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel \"Virtual Tensor Core\" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of \"Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA).\" Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u6838'\u7684\u7eaf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3aARM64\uff08\u5982Apple Silicon\uff09\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5b58\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u624b\u8c03NEON\u6307\u4ee4\u548cTVL\u5e03\u5c40\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7a81\u7834\u5185\u5b58\u5899\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728M2\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d8560 token/s\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\uff0c\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3200ms\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e'\u5185\u5b58\u5899'\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5373\u6570\u636e\u642c\u8fd0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fdc\u8d85\u8ba1\u7b97\u541e\u5410\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u56e0\u9ad8\u5c42\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u53d1\u548c\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bbf\u5b58\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7eaf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684'\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u6838'\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u91c7\u7528mmap\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u5bb9\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u5185\u5b58\u6620\u5c04\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u624b\u8c03NEON SIMD\u5185\u6838\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49Tensor Virtualization Layout\uff08TVL\uff09\u786e\u4fdd\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635100%\u7f13\u5b58\u884c\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u96f6\u62f7\u8d1d\u52a0\u8f7d\u5668\u6d88\u9664\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728M2\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf91.1\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0>60 tokens/\u79d2\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\uff1b\u6ee1\u8db3200ms\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684ARM\u901a\u7528\u7845\u7247\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7eaf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\uff08\u5982AMX\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7f13\u89e3ARM\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5899\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdfLLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\\% absolute accuracy improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSAE-Steering\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u81ea\u4e3b\u9009\u62e9\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u6548\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4f46\u56e0\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAE-Steering\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u5173\u952e\u8bcdlogits\u653e\u5927\u53ec\u56de\u76f8\u5173\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8d8599%\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u6309\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u5269\u4f59\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "SAE-Steering\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd515%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5c06LRMs\u4ece\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u81f3\u6b63\u786e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e26\u67657%\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eSAEs\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u4e0eSAE-Steering\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u63a7\u5236LRMs\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference.

This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms.

Instead of repetitively scanning embedded photoreceivers, this design uses a stereo vision setup comprising two DVS cameras looking sideways through the skin. Such a design produces events as changes in brightness are detected, and estimates press positions on the 2D skin surface through triangulation, utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to find the center of mass of contact events resulting from pressing actions. The system is evaluated over a 4620 mm2 probed area of the skin using a meander raster scan. Across 95 % of the presses visible to both cameras, the press localization achieved a Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.66 mm. The results highlight the potential of this approach for wide-area flexible and responsive tactile sensors in soft robotics and interactive environments. Moreover, we examined how the system performs when the amount of event data is strongly reduced. Using stochastic down-sampling, the event stream was reduced to 1/1024 of its original size. Under this extreme reduction, the average localization error increased only slightly (from 4.66 mm to 9.33 mm), and the system still produced valid press localizations for 85 % of the trials. This reduction in pass rate is expected, as some presses no longer produce enough events to form a reliable cluster for triangulation. These results show that the sensing approach remains functional even with very sparse event data, which is promising for reducing power consumption and computational load in future implementations. The system exhibits a detection latency distribution with a characteristic width of 31 ms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08DVS\uff09\u4e0e\u67d4\u6027\u7845\u80f6\u5149\u6ce2\u5bfc\u76ae\u80a4\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u76ee\u4fa7\u5411\u6210\u50cf\u4e0eDBSCAN\u805a\u7c7b\u5b9e\u73b02D\u6309\u538b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u8f6f\u6027\u76ae\u80a4\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u5f00\u53d1\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u3001\u67d4\u6027\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u5468\u671f\u6027\u626b\u63cf\u5f0f\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u529f\u8017\u4e0e\u5ef6\u65f6\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fa7\u5411\u5b89\u88c5\u7684DVS\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u900f\u8fc7\u67d4\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u6ce2\u5bfc\u76ae\u80a4\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eae\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u89e6\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u5408DBSCAN\u805a\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6309\u538b\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u86c7\u5f62\u6805\u683c\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u964d\u81f31/1024\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7387\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a00\u758f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57284620 mm\u00b2\u63a2\u6d4b\u9762\u79ef\u4e0a\uff0c95%\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u53ef\u89c1\u6309\u538b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4dRMSE\u4e3a4.66 mm\uff1b\u6781\u7aef\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u540e\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec5\u589e\u81f39.33 mm\uff0c85%\u6309\u538b\u4ecd\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e3a31 ms\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u89e6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5f3a\u7a00\u758f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ca\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f20\u611f\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Stapleton"], "title": "A path to natural language through tokenisation and transformers", "comment": "19 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables", "summary": "Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b57\u8282\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\uff08BPE\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0BPE\u9012\u5f52\u5e94\u7528\u4f7f\u8bcd\u9891\u8d8b\u5411\u9f50\u666e\u592b\u5e42\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u4e0e\u9f50\u666e\u592b\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u9010\u6e10\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660eBPE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5177\u6709\u9f50\u666e\u592b\u5f8b\u548c\u5e0c\u666e\u65af\u5f8b\u7b49\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u7528\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982BPE\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9f50\u666e\u592b\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u9999\u519c\u71b5\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u69fd\u71b5\u671f\u671b\u503c\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76BPE\u5bf9\u8bed\u6599\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u540cBPE\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u9a8c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "BPE\u9012\u5f52\u5e94\u7528\u4f7f\u8bcd\u9891\u8d8b\u8fd1\u9f50\u666e\u592b\u5e42\u5f8b\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u71b5\u5448\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u968f\u7740BPE\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u7b26\u5408\u9f50\u666e\u592b\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8bcd\u5143\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5f31\u4f9d\u8d56\uff08\u8fd1\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "BPE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u80fd\u91cd\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u5c5e\u6027\u3002"}}

Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGAMBIT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u8d8a\u72f1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5177\u5907\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9MLLMs\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u5907\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08Chain-of-Thought\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5176\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u8d8a\u72f1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGAMBIT\uff08Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u91cd\u7ec4\u6709\u5bb3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u2018\u53c2\u4e0e\u6e38\u620f\u2019\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u91cd\u6784\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u4f5c\u7b54\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gemini 2.5 Flash\u3001QvQ-MAX\u548cGPT-4o\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u975e\u63a8\u7406MLLMs\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8fbe92.13%\u300191.20%\u548c85.87%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\u6784\u5efa\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u9677\u9631\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u524a\u5f31MLLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u5177\u5907\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002"}}

However, they typically function as semantic reasoners, lacking an intrinsic understanding of the specific robot's physical capabilities. This limitation is particularly critical in interactive navigation, where robots must actively modify cluttered environments to create traversable paths. Existing VLM-based navigators are predominantly confined to passive obstacle avoidance, failing to reason about when and how to interact with objects to clear blocked paths. To bridge this gap, we propose Counterfactual Interactive Navigation via Skill-aware VLM (CoINS), a hierarchical framework that integrates skill-aware reasoning and robust low-level execution. Specifically, we fine-tune a VLM, named InterNav-VLM, which incorporates skill affordance and concrete constraint parameters into the input context and grounds them into a metric-scale environmental representation. By internalizing the logic of counterfactual reasoning through fine-tuning on the proposed InterNav dataset, the model learns to implicitly evaluate the causal effects of object removal on navigation connectivity, thereby determining interaction necessity and target selection. To execute the generated high-level plans, we develop a comprehensive skill library through reinforcement learning, specifically introducing traversability-oriented strategies to manipulate diverse objects for path clearance. A systematic benchmark in Isaac Sim is proposed to evaluate both the reasoning and execution aspects of interactive navigation. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that CoINS significantly outperforms representative baselines, achieving a 17\\% higher overall success rate and over 80\\% improvement in complex long-horizon scenarios compared to the best-performing baseline", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCoINS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08InterNav-VLM\uff09\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u5907\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742 cluttered \u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u6e05\u969c\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u4ec5\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u8eab\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e3b\u52a8\u6e05\u969c\u7b49\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6CoINS\uff1a1\uff09\u5fae\u8c03VLM\uff08InterNav-VLM\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5165\u6280\u80fd\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u81ea\u5efaInterNav\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u9700\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ca\u9009\u62e9\u4ea4\u4e92\u76ee\u6807\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u5411\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u6027\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\uff0c\u652f\u6491\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Isaac Sim\u57fa\u51c6\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCoINS\u76f8\u8f83\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u6574\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534717%\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u8d8580%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6280\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5d4c\u5165VLM\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5177\u8eab\u6280\u80fd\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8d4b\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b8c\u6210\u9700\u73af\u5883\u6539\u9020\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3aVLM\u5411\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u6f14\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models.

We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study.

Existing agricultural models often struggle to balance the fine-grained feature extraction required for biological attribute classification with the efficiency needed for real-time deployment. To address this, WeedRepFormer systematically integrates structural reparameterization across the entire architecture - comprising a Vision Transformer backbone, a Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a novel reparameterizable classification head - to decouple training-time capacity from inference-time latency.

While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative \"eureka moments\" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \\emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faR\u00b2VPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3PPO/GRPO\u4e2d\u7684\u786c\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u8fc7\u65f6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u7387\u88c1\u526a\u7684PPO/GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u622a\u65ad\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u4f46\u9ad8\u6563\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u5173\u952e\u2018\u987f\u609f\u65f6\u523b\u2019\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u7a0d\u65e7\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u7387\u4e8c\u9636\u4e2d\u5fc3\u77e9\uff08\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u57df\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u6846\u67b6\u7684R\u00b2VPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u677e\u5f1b\u786c\u88c1\u526a\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8fc7\u65f6\u6837\u672c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u590d\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\u548copenPangu-Embedded\uff081B/7B\uff09\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cR\u00b2VPO\u76f8\u8f83\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe17%\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u6240\u9700rollout\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea650%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u7387\u65b9\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347RL\u9a71\u52a8LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose \\textbf{Residual Semantic Steering (RSS)}, a probabilistic framework that disentangles physical affordance from semantic execution. RSS introduces two theoretical innovations: (1) \\textbf{Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration}, which approximates the true semantic posterior via dense, LLM-driven distributional expansion, and (2) \\textbf{Residual Affordance Steering}, a dual-stream decoding mechanism that explicitly isolates the causal influence of language by subtracting the visual affordance prior.

Plummer"], "title": "Breaking the Assistant Mold: Modeling Behavioral Variation in LLM Based Procedural Character Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Procedural content generation has enabled vast virtual worlds through levels, maps, and quests, but large-scale character generation remains underexplored. We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates.

The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation.

Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel \"Reason-then-Summarize\" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Existing Latent Action Models attempt to leverage video data but often suffer from visual entanglement, capturing noise rather than manipulation skills. To address this, we propose Contrastive Latent Action Pretraining (CLAP), a framework that aligns the visual latent space from videos with a proprioceptive latent space from robot trajectories. By employing contrastive learning, CLAP maps video transitions onto a quantized, physically executable codebook. Building on this representation, we introduce a dual-formulation VLA framework offering both CLAP-NTP, an autoregressive model excelling at instruction following and object generalization, and CLAP-RF, a Rectified Flow-based policy designed for high-frequency, precise manipulation. Furthermore, we propose a Knowledge Matching (KM) regularization strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning.

In this work, we address the problem of data protection against unwanted model learning in a realistic black-box setting. We propose Disclaimer Injection, a novel data-level defence that renders text unlearnable to LLMs. Rather than relying on model-side controls or explicit data removal, our approach exploits the models' own alignment mechanisms: by injecting carefully designed alignment-triggering disclaimers to prevent effective learning. Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSandwich Reasoning\uff08SandwichR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Answer-Reasoning-Answer\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoT\uff09\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea0\u9519\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea0\u9519\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea0\u9519\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u4e25\u82db\u65f6\u5ef6\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u800c\u63d0\u524d\u8f93\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\u53c8\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u517c\u987e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSandwichR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Answer-Reasoning-Answer\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8303\u5f0f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u7ea6\u675f\u521d\u7b54\u4e0e\u7ec8\u7b54\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u95f4\u9694\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u805a\u7126\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u76ca\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff1b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e13\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea0\u9519\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6CoT\u76f8\u5f53SOTA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b040\u201370%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u5728\u7ebf\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "SandwichR\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u7ea0\u9519\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. While many decoding methods still rely on Euclidean embeddings, recent work has begun exploring hyperbolic geometry for EEG. Hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first empirically demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHEEGNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u53cc\u66f2\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528EEG\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u7b49\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aEEG\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u89e3\u7801\u56e0\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u7b49\u57df\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u800cEEG\u8574\u542b\u5c42\u7ea7\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u7136\u9002\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5c42\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728EEG\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1EEG\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u66f2\u6027\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51faHEEGNet\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u6b27\u6c0f\u4e0e\u53cc\u66f2\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00EEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u8bf1\u53d1\u7535\u4f4d\u3001\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9885\u5185EEG\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cHEEGNet\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53cc\u66f2\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u662f\u5efa\u6a21EEG\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff1bHEEGNet\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u65b0\u578b\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u53cc\u66f2\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2EEG\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test", "comment": null, "summary": "As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aWow-wo-val\u7684Embodied Turing Test\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u6267\u884c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4f5c\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u80fd\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e609\u6bb5\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u7684Wow-wo-val\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u4e94\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u542b22\u9879\u6307\u6807\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff08IDM\uff09\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u5f97\u5206\u4ec517.27\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u4ec568.02\uff1bIDM\u56fe\u7075\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a\u22480%\uff0c\u800cWoW\u8fbe40.74%\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597dPearson\u76f8\u5173\u6027>0.93\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u611f\u77e5\u2014\u73b0\u5b9e\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u50cfWow-wo-val\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5411\u5177\u8eab\u90e8\u7f72\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u9886\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7528\u836f\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u652f\u6301\u836f\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u4ece\u6700\u591a7\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u81f3\u5c1128\u79cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7528\u836f\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4ec5\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6700\u591a7\u79cd\u836f\u7269\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u7528\u836f\u89c4\u5212\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u540e\u7ee7\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6700\u4f73\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\uff08GBFS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u89c4\u5212\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u836f\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u81f3\u5c1128\u79cd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u533b\u7597\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems.

Existing memory systems largely follow two paradigms: explicit structured memories offer interpretability but often become brittle under long-context overload, while latent memory mechanisms are efficient and stable yet difficult to inspect. We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning.

This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u4ecd\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e0e\u4e25\u8c28\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5982Transformer\u3001ViT\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u89c4\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00/\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u867d\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u53ca\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5c42\u9762\u534f\u540c\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheeled robot that explores a maze using its own decision-making and sensor data. Experimental results show that the agent successfully solved the maze in 59 seconds using 287 reasoning cycles, with decision phases taking less than one millisecond. These results indicate that the reasoning process is efficient enough for real-time execution on resource-constrained hardware. This integration demonstrates how high-level agent-based control can be applied to resource-constrained embedded systems for autonomous operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eAgentSpeak\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5c0f\u578b\u4e24\u8f6e\u8ff7\u5bab\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u6210\u529f\u572859\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u8ff7\u5bab\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\u5e38\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u5177\u5907\u672c\u5730\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eAgentSpeak\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u4e24\u8f6e\u8ff7\u5bab\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u572859\u79d2\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u8ff7\u5bab\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5171\u6267\u884c287\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u51b3\u7b56\u8017\u65f6\u4f4e\u4e8e1\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u9636\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u672c\u5730\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we introduce PCoA, an expert-annotated benchmark for medical aspect-based summarization with phrase-level context attribution. PCoA aligns each aspect-based summary with its supporting contextual sentences and contributory phrases within them. We further propose a fine-grained, decoupled evaluation framework that independently assesses the quality of generated summaries, citations, and contributory phrases. Through extensive experiments, we validate the quality and consistency of the PCoA dataset and benchmark several large language models on the proposed task. Experimental results demonstrate that PCoA provides a reliable benchmark for evaluating system-generated summaries with phrase-level context attribution.

We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies.

However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u542b\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u4f4e\u8d28\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u2014\u2014\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u4f46\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u5ba1\u7f8e/\u504f\u597d\u7c7b\u3001\u56fe\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7c7b\uff09\u5355\u72ec\u53ca\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u5171\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u4f2a\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f2a\u5f71\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5668\u5d4c\u5165RL\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aT2I RL\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u5f71\u5956\u52b1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u5f0a\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u5982\u4f2a\u5f71\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e3b\u6d41\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u5347T2I\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline). The memory overhead is approximately 10x at L=64.

Through token-level analysis and physician case studies, we demonstrate that CAPT amplifies clinically actionable language, reduces context errors, and increases clinical specificity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u4ee3\u7406\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08CAPT\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u8bcd\u8868\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9002\u5e94\u4e34\u5e8a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCross-Architecture Proxy Tuning\uff08CAPT\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u2018\u4ee3\u7406\u2019\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff08contrastive decoding\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6ce8\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bcd\u8868\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cCAPT\u4ee5\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b+\u65e7\u4ee3\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4UniTE\u9ad817.6%\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfproxy tuning\u9ad841.4%\uff1btoken\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u533b\u751f\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CAPT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\uff08GPR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfKCC\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u672c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u5931\u6548\u9762\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KCC\u7b49\u7ecf\u9a8c\u672c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u5b9a\u7684\u5931\u6548\u9762\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5916\u63a8\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301KCC\u6a21\u578b\u5f39\u5851\u6027\u6a21\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u7528\u65bd\u52a0\u5bfc\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606fGPR\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u4ee3\u5176\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5931\u6548\u9762\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u56f4\u538b\u4e0b\u7684\u4e09\u8f74\u538b\u7f29\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u56f4\u538b\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675fGPR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675fGPR\uff1a\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u533a\u57df\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u66f4\u7d27\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u52a0\u5165\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u7ea6\u675fGPR\u4ecd\u6613\u8fdd\u53cd\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u987eKCC\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU.

Experimenting with a newly constructed benchmark of 26K aspect-document pairs, we found that ASPECTSIM, when implemented with direct GPT-4o prompting, achieves substantially higher human-machine agreement ($\\approx$80% higher) than the same for holistic similarity without explicit aspects. These findings underscore the importance of explicitly accounting for aspects when measuring document similarity and highlight the need to revise standard practice. Next, we conducted a large-scale meta-evaluation using 16 smaller open-source LLMs and 9 embedding models with a focus on making ASPECTSIM accessible and reproducible. While directly prompting LLMs to produce ASPECTSIM scores turned out be ineffective (20-30% human-machine agreement), a simple two-stage refinement improved their agreement by $\\approx$140%.

The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including \"crimes against the person\" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary.

While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5e72\u6270\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff08SDCD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6253\u4e71\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6765\u6291\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u56e0\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u504f\u597d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u9ad8\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5374\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u6e90\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5f31\u7ed3\u6784\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684Bag-of-Patches\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding\uff08SDCD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u88ab\u7834\u574f\uff08\u5982patch\u6253\u4e71\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u5728\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u5931\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684token\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6291\u5236\u7eb9\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "SDCD\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LVLMs\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u662f\u7269\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6210\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6821\u51c6\uff08\u5982SDCD\uff09\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6295\u5f71\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\uff08PQK\uff09\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aCNN\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728MNIST\u548cCIFAR-10\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178CNN\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CNN\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\uff08PQK\uff09\u5f15\u5165CNN\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec51000\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\uff0cPQK-enhanced CNN\u5728MNIST\u548cCIFAR-10\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523095%\u548c90%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u7ecf\u5178CNN\u768460%\u548c12%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6295\u5f71\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8f85\u52a9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We study the LLM-as-a-judge problem by comparing two kinds of raters: humans and LLMs. We collect ratings from both groups on three scales and across six benchmarks that include objective, open-ended subjective, and mixed tasks. Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment.

In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).

We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAnswer Set Programming\uff08ASP\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\uff09\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u591a\u6570\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6811\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4SAT\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u5168\u679a\u4e3e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u652f\u6301\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SAT\uff09\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u679a\u4e3e\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Answer Set Programming\uff08ASP\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6210\u5145\u5206\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3001\u591a\u6570\u53ca\u6811\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u56db\u7c7b\u903b\u8f91\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528ASP\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u52bf\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u5168\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u679a\u4e3e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5ASP\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5404\u7c7b\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u679a\u4e3e\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eSAT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "ASP\u662f\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6709\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5929\u6c14\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5373\u670d\u52a1\uff08DaaS\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u7531\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982A*\u3001Dijkstra\uff09\u867d\u6700\u4f18\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5929\u6c14\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fd0\u884c\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6c14\u8c61\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5929\u6c14\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528Transformer\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u98ce\u901f\u3001\u98ce\u5411\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u7b49\u6c14\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u5b50\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u4e00\u8df3\u8282\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8def\u7531\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\uff1bTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6c14\u8c61\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21DaaS\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6c14\u8c61\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u662fDaaS\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their \"black-box\" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faxDNN(ASP)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08ASP\uff09\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u903b\u8f91\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u8282\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u7b49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709xAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SHAP\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u6b63\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faxDNN(ASP)\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ca\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u903b\u8f91\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1b\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u6620\u5c04\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u9690\u85cf\u8282\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u5404\u9690\u85cf\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6307\u5bfc\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u8282\u70b9\u88c1\u526a\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "xDNN(ASP)\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u517c\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfxAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models.

While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable.

While zero-shot prompting performs near chance, linear probes improve average F1 from 0.15-0.26 to 0.61-0.67, often matching or exceeding specialized time series models.

While effective over short horizons this approach does not separate observation reconstruction with dynamics modeling and offers no explicit representation of the latent causes governing motion. As a result, existing methods exhibit compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond the training regime. Here we propose a Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) that reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold. Rather than predicting poses directly, SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This alignment imposes a structural information bottleneck that prevents the latent state from encoding static geometry or sensor noise, forcing it to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure. Inspired by belief-state world models developed for model-based reinforcement learning, SBWM adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to the domain of human motion. In contrast to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity, SBWM prioritizes stable forward simulation.

However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping.

Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9762\u4e34\u9700\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9884\u89c1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u7c7b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u63a2\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6574\u5408\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6781\u5c11\u8c03\u7528\u6a21\u62df\uff08<1%\uff09\uff0c\u5e38\u8bef\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08\u7ea615%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u62df\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u5e38\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u751a\u81f3\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe5%\uff09\uff1b\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u6307\u51fa\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u2018\u4f55\u65f6\u6a21\u62df\u2019\u3001\u2018\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u8bfb\u9884\u6d4b\u2019\u53ca\u2018\u5982\u4f55\u6574\u5408\u9884\u89c1\u4fe1\u606f\u2019\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles.

In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "CloudMatch is a semi-supervised cloud detection framework using view-consistency learning and scene-mixing augmentations (inter- and intra-scene) to better capture cloud structural diversity and contextual variability, improving pseudolabeling and generalization with unlabeled remote sensing data.", "motivation": "High cost of pixel-level annotation for cloud detection motivates semi-supervised learning; cloud patterns show structural diversity and contextual variability across and within scenes, which existing methods fail to fully exploit.", "method": "CloudMatch employs view-consistency learning on three augmented views per unlabeled image: one weakly augmented, and two strongly augmented\u2014inter-scene mixed (for contextual variety) and intra-scene mixed (for semantic coherence)\u2014to guide pseudolabel generation.", "result": "CloudMatch achieves strong performance in semi-supervised cloud detection, demonstrating efficient use of unlabeled data and improved generalization over prior methods.", "conclusion": "Enforcing prediction consistency across diversely scene-mixed views effectively captures cloud pattern complexity, making CloudMatch a robust and scalable solution for semi-supervised cloud detection."}}

Schmidt", "Florian Bernard"], "title": "Jailbreaking LLMs Without Gradients or Priors: Effective and Transferable Attacks", "comment": null, "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, rigorously evaluating their robustness against adversarial jailbreaks is essential. However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate.

This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems.

We propose Supervised Moral Rationale Attention (SMRA), the first self-explaining hate speech detection framework to incorporate moral rationales as direct supervision for attention alignment. Based on Moral Foundations Theory, SMRA aligns token-level attention with expert-annotated moral rationales, guiding models to attend to morally salient spans rather than spurious lexical patterns. Unlike prior rationale-supervised or post-hoc approaches, SMRA integrates moral rationale supervision directly into the training objective, producing inherently interpretable and contextualized explanations. To support our framework, we also introduce HateBRMoralXplain, a Brazilian Portuguese benchmark dataset annotated with hate labels, moral categories, token-level moral rationales, and socio-political metadata. Across binary hate speech detection and multi-label moral sentiment classification, SMRA consistently improves performance (e.g., +0.9 and +1.5 F1, respectively) while substantially enhancing explanation faithfulness, increasing IoU F1 (+7.4 pp) and Token F1 (+5.0 pp).

However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward.

While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively.

We term this scar \\textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\\approx 38\\%$ of lost information flow.\n  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5236\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8c31\uff08attention-graph spectra\uff09\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u03bb\u2082\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u3001\u8c31\u71b5\uff09\u53ef\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u2018\u8c31\u6307\u7eb9\u2019\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u65ad\u5c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u5207\u6362\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u2018\u88ab\u52a8\u89e6\u53d1\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u2019\uff08PTCC\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5206\u8bcd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u79cd\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u53ea\u80fd\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u6a21\u578b\u2018\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48\u2019\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u2018\u5982\u4f55\u505a\u2019\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6df1\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u3001\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u673a\u5236\u63a2\u9488\uff1a\u5c06\u6bcf\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u56fe\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u4ee3\u6570\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff08\u03bb\u2082\uff09\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u548c\u8c31\u71b5\uff1b\u572812\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u300110\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u63d0\u53d6\u2018\u8c31\u6307\u7eb9\u2019\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8fc7\u6e21\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e72\u9884\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5236\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse\uff08PTCC\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u7279\u5b9a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5207\u6362\uff08\u5982code-to-chat\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u82f1\u8bed\u975e\u5178\u578b\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u03bb\u2082\u9aa4\u964d\u2248\u22120.76\uff1bPTCC\u53cd\u6620\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8def\u7531\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa4\u79cd\u91cd\u590d\u52a0\u5de5\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8c31\u7cfb\u6eaf\u6e90\uff1b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5230Layer 2\u7a00\u758f\u2018\u8865\u507f\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u2019\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7ea638%\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff1b\u4e3b\u6d41\u62d3\u6251\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5206\u8bcd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u8eab\u4efd\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u8c31\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u673a\u5236\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction.

The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model.

In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves.

In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCOMMITTEEAUDIT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8de8\u5c42\u7684'\u5e38\u8bbe\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a'\uff08Standing Committee\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4e00\u7ec4\u88ab\u9891\u7e41\u8def\u7531\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u627f\u62c5\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u5bb6\u5219\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660eMoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u635f\u5931\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u76f8\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591MoE\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5426\u771f\u5448\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCOMMITTEEAUDIT\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7fa4\u4f53\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8def\u7531\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027MoE\u6a21\u578b\u548cMMLU\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8de8\u5c42\u3001\u8de8\u8def\u7531\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u2018\u5e38\u8bbe\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u2019\uff0c\u5b83\u6301\u7eed\u627f\u8f7d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8def\u7531\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u8be5\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4e3b\u8981\u951a\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u5916\u56f4\u4e13\u5bb6\u624d\u8d1f\u8d23\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u7b49\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u80cc\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u503e\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5e76\u975e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the \"distributional deviations\"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff08MPFT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\uff08TAM\uff09\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3aCLIP-ViT\u5bf9AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4AI\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u4fe1\u4efb\u5371\u673a\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3CLIP\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u51bb\u7ed3CLIP-ViT\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u805a\u7c7b\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5047\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faMPFT\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f15\u5165TAM\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u906e\u853d\u542b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6709\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728GenImage\u548cUniversalFakeDetect\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u8fbe98.2%\u548c94.6%\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MPFT\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51bb\u7ed3CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u805a\u7126\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u6bd4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7eb9\u7406\u7ebf\u7d22\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002"}}

In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions.

However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).\n  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.\n  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa'\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6f02\u79fb'\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5176\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6027\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6db5\u76d612\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684Agent\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08ASI\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa'\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6f02\u79fb'\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\u4e09\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u7ef4Agent\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08ASI\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6f02\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u6240\u63d0\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6574\u5408\u3001\u6f02\u79fb\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u951a\u5b9a\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u672a\u52a0\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6f02\u79fb\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u6f02\u79fb\u76f8\u5173\u9519\u8bef\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8c03\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0eAI\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant \"spatial gap\" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential.

Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern.

However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \\cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eEM\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u56e0\u679cDAG\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u56e0\u679cDAG\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5e26\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e00\u9636EM\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u6536\u7f29\u6027\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u4f46\u6e90\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u9ad8\u65af\u56e0\u679cDAG\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u8fc1\u79fb\u5f0f\u63d2\u8865\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684EM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679cDAG\u7ed3\u6784\u878d\u5408\u6e90\u57df\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u6784\u5efaDAG\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u603b\u4f53EM\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u5355\u6b65\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u66ff\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58M\u6b65\uff1b\u51bb\u7ed3\u6e90\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ec5\u91cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d7\u504f\u79fb\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e00\u9636EM\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5c40\u90e8\u5f3a\u51f9\u6027\u3001\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u6536\u7f29\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51e0\u4f55\u6536\u655b\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u53c2\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u63d2\u8865\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u57287\u8282\u70b9\u5408\u6210SEM\u300164\u8282\u70b9MAGIC-IRRI\u7f51\u7edc\u548cSachs\u86cb\u767d\u4fe1\u53f7\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e90\u57df\u62df\u5408\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u548cKiiveri\u5f0fEM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u589e\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679cDAG\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfcEM\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u4e00\u9636EM\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5177\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u7f3a\u5931\u63d2\u8865\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches rely on external classifiers, most commonly BERT based models, which suffer from limited context windows, constrained representational capacity, and additional computational overhead. We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "IntroLM \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5185\u7701\u6807\u8bb0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6LoRA\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u5982BERT\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5c0f\u3001\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u53ca\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIntroLM\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5185\u7701token\u548ctoken\u6761\u4ef6LoRA\uff0c\u5728prefill\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba9\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8bc4\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e72\u6270\u6b63\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cIntroLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eQwen3-8B\u8fbe\u523090% ROC AUC\uff0c\u6bd4DeBERTa\u9ad814%\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e33%\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1150%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "IntroLM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7684LLM\u81ea\u7701\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6210\u672c-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance.

However, existing benchmarks either evaluate multi-session memory in text-only conversations or assess multimodal understanding within localized contexts, failing to evaluate how multimodal memory is preserved, organized, and evolved across long-term conversational trajectories. Thus, we introduce Mem-Gallery, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal long-term conversational memory in MLLM agents. Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies. Building on this dataset, we propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses key memory capabilities along three functional dimensions: memory extraction and test-time adaptation, memory reasoning, and memory knowledge management. Extensive benchmarking across thirteen memory systems reveals several key findings, highlighting the necessity of explicit multimodal information retention and memory organization, the persistent limitations in memory reasoning and knowledge management, as well as the efficiency bottleneck of current models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Mem-Gallery\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30MLLM\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u56fe\u6587\uff09\u7684Mem-Gallery\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8986\u76d6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u6d4b\u63ed\u793a\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "Mem-Gallery\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8MLLM\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability.

In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{VeRPO} (\\textbf{V}erifiable D\\textbf{e}nse \\textbf{R}eward \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \\textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVeRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u90e8\u5206\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u96f6\u989d\u5916\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684pass/fail\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08RM\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "VeRPO\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5404\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5176\u96be\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6743\u91cd\u6c42\u548c\u5f62\u6210\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eoutcome-driven\u548cRM-based\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cpass@1\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347+8.83%\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500<0.02%\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u96f6\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "VeRPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u679c\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5360\u7528\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists.

Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times.

Existing approaches often face challenges in balancing strong spherical geometric inductive biases with the need to model real-world heterogeneity. To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency. Evaluations on spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation and molecule structure modeling demonstrate the superiority of GSNO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Green\u51fd\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff08DGF\uff09\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b83\u7684Green\u51fd\u6570\u7403\u9762\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08GSNO\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b49\u53d8\u3001\u4e0d\u53d8\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4e09\u79cdGreen\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7403\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7403\u9762\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7403\u9762\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u7403\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u5982\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u504f\u597d\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u8bbe\u8ba1Green\u51fd\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff08DGF\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u9020\u65cb\u8f6c\u7fa4\u4e0b\u7684Green\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u6784\u5efaGSNO\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u5b50\u89e3\uff1a\u7b49\u53d8\u89e3\uff08\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff09\u3001\u4e0d\u53d8\u89e3\uff08\u6d88\u9664\u5e72\u6270\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff09\u3001\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u89e3\uff08\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u7ea4\u7ef4\uff09\u3002", "result": "GSNO\u5728\u7403\u9762MNIST\u3001\u6d45\u6c34\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001dMRI\u7ea4\u7ef4\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u76ae\u5c42\u5206\u533a\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GSNO\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8bbe\u8ba1Green\u51fd\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u7403\u9762\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7403\u9762\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While retrieval capabilities are well-benchmarked, the post-retrieval synthesis stage--where agents must digest massive amounts of context and consolidate fragmented evidence into coherent, long-form reports--remains under-evaluated due to the subjectivity of open-ended writing. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSynth-Eval, a benchmark designed to objectively evaluate information consolidation capabilities. We leverage high-quality survey papers as gold standards, reverse-engineering research requests and constructing \"Oracle Contexts\" from their bibliographies to isolate synthesis from retrieval noise. We propose a fine-grained evaluation protocol using General Checklists (for factual coverage) and Constraint Checklists (for structural organization), transforming subjective judgment into verifiable metrics. Experiments across 96 tasks reveal that synthesizing information from hundreds of references remains a significant challenge. Our results demonstrate that agentic plan-and-write workflows significantly outperform single-turn generation, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving adherence to complex structural constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DeepSynth-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u540e\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u957f\u7bc7\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u201cOracle Contexts\u201d\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u68c0\u67e5\u8868\uff08\u901a\u7528\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212-\u5199\u4f5c\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u540e\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u2014\u2014\u5373\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u788e\u7247\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u957f\u7bc7\u62a5\u544a\u2014\u2014\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u6d89\u53ca\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5199\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDeepSynth-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u4ee5\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7efc\u8ff0\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u5176\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u6784\u9020\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u7684'Oracle Contexts'\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u7c7b\u68c0\u67e5\u8868\u2014\u2014\u901a\u7528\u68c0\u67e5\u8868\uff08\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8986\u76d6\uff09\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u68c0\u67e5\u8868\uff08\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u4e3b\u89c2\u5199\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u572896\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u6570\u767e\u7bc7\u6587\u732e\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u91c7\u7528agentic plan-and-write\u6d41\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u662fLLM\u8fc8\u5411\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff1bDeepSynth-Eval\u4e3a\u8be5\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry.

Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals.

Recent work proposes \\emph{hop-aligned circuit hypothesis}, suggesting that bridge entities are computed sequentially across layers before later-hop answers. Through systematic analyses on real-world multi-hop queries, we show that this hop-aligned assumption does not generalize: later-hop answer entities can become decodable earlier than bridge entities, a phenomenon we call \\emph{layer-order inversion}, which strengthens with total hops. To explain this behavior, we propose a \\emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge.

Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity.

Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u672c\u5f81\u7ef4\u6570\uff08LID\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5stLID\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6ed1\u5761\u5931\u7a33\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6ed1\u5761\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5730\u8868\u4f4d\u79fb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u5185\u5728\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6ed1\u5761\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5728sLID\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u6269\u5c55\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u589e\u5f3a\u2014\u2014\u5f15\u5165\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u77ed\u671f\u53d8\u5f62\u901f\u7387\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u2014\u2014\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u805a\u5408\u90bb\u57dfsLID\u503c\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u2014\u2014\u63d0\u51fatLID\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4d\u79fb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6stLID\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cstLID\u5728\u5931\u7a33\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9884\u8b66\u63d0\u524d\u91cf\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "stLID\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u7a7a\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5730\u8d28\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u6ed1\u5761\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5730\u8d28\u707e\u5bb3\u9632\u63a7\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This framework enables scalable generation of multi-session conversations with controllable complexity, accompanied by sample-specific evaluation guidelines.

Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks.

In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMGPC\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u70b9\u4e91\u3001RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u4e22\u5f03\u7b56\u7565\u3001Transformer\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6MGPC-1M\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u5355\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMGPC\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6a21\u6001\u4e22\u5f03\u7b56\u7565\u3001Transformer\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6MGPC-1M\uff08\u542b\u8d85\u767e\u4e07\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u3001\u5343\u4f59\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728MGPC-1M\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MGPC\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a \"Coherence Barrier\"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models.

We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing.

In this work, we propose PhysVideoGenerator, a proof-of-concept framework that explicitly embeds a learnable physics prior into the video generation process. We introduce a lightweight predictor network, PredictorP, which regresses high-level physical features extracted from a pre-trained Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA 2) directly from noisy diffusion latents. These predicted physics tokens are injected into the temporal attention layers of a DiT-based generator (Latte) via a dedicated cross-attention mechanism. Our primary contribution is demonstrating the technical feasibility of this joint training paradigm: we show that diffusion latents contain sufficient information to recover V-JEPA 2 physical representations, and that multi-task optimization remains stable over training.

Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5ECGR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u8d21\u732e\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5176\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u626d\u66f2\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6f02\u79fb\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5730\u8c03\u63a7\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u53d7\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation\uff08ECGR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u91cf\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5305\u62ecLC25000\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u8868\u660e\uff0cECGR\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cdSOTA\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5730\u68af\u5ea6\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8c03\u63a7\u6760\u6746\uff0cECGR\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4fa7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy.

Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence.

To maintain causal consistency, we further introduce a causal diffusion noise schedule that respects the temporal structure of reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on three multi-step CoT reasoning benchmarks across diverse model backbones demonstrate that DiffCoT consistently outperforms existing CoT preference optimization methods, yielding improved robustness and error-correction capability in CoT reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDiffCoT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u673a\u5236\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u6269\u6563\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7279\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u4e0e\u56de\u6eaf\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "Chain-of-Thought\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6613\u53d7\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffCoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06CoT\u63a8\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56de\u6eaf\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u679c\u6269\u6563\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u6b65CoT\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cDiffCoT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e0a\u5747\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709CoT\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffCoT\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347CoT\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u601d\u60f3\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBREATH-VL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b36\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u76f8\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f4d\u59ff\u56de\u5f52\u96be\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4e3a\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u5927\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6c14\u9053\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u96c6BREATH\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347VLM\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "VLM\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u57286-DoF\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u9762\u5411\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1bVLM\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f4d\u59ff\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u878d\u5408VLM\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u6784\u5efaBREATH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u2014\u2014\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u4f53\u6c14\u9053\u5185\u7aa5\u955c6-DoF\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51faBREATH-VL\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8054\u5408VLM\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u914d\u51c6\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u5386\u53f2\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "BREATH-VL\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e25.5%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u590d\u6742\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff08BREATH-VL\uff09\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u7aa5\u955c6-DoF\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff1bBREATH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u65f6\u5e8f\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u533b\u7597VLM\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling.

However, how large language models (LLMs) acquire, retain, and forget such concepts during continual pretraining remains poorly understood. In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u2018\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u2019\uff08Concept Circuits\uff09\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u4f46LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e60\u5f97\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u6982\u5ff5\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u5c42\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\u5173\u8054\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u83b7\u53d6/\u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\u3001\u5e72\u6270/\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u4e0e\u56fe\u5ea6\u91cf\u523b\u753b\u7535\u8def\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(1) \u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u8868\u5f81\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b(2) \u7535\u8def\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5448\u5148\u5347\u540e\u964d\u518d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u6f14\u5316\uff1b(3) \u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u76ca\u5927\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b(4) \u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b(5) \u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u7535\u8def\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDomain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57df\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u7684\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u88c5\u914d\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u51c6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eff\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7eaf\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDA3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5c11\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u5931\u51c6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57df\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u84b8\u998f\u771f\u5b9e\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9000\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u5931\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u955c\u5934\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDA3\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u4eff\u771f\u6d41\u7a0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534746%\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f7f\u75283\u4e2a\u955c\u5934\u6837\u672c\u7cbe\u786e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1198.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8d4b\u4e88\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5065\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5149\u5b66\u88c5\u914d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06Levin\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08LTS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u914d\u5230\u601d\u7ef4\u6811\uff08ToT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eToT\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347LM\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LM\u5bf9\u2018\u601d\u7ef4\u2019\uff08thoughts\uff09\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06Levin\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08LTS\uff09\u5f15\u5165ToT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff08\u5982\u72b6\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u4e0a\u754c\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fa\u5b9aLM\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0cLTS\u5728Blocksworld\u3001PrOntoQA\u3001Array Sorting\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cLM\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5747\u4e0d\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LTS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eToT\u4e2d\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u8282\u7701\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Current evaluative approaches primarily rely on refusal-based safety signals, which offer limited insight into the nuanced behaviors required in clinical practice. In mental health, clinically inadequate refusals can be perceived as unempathetic and discourage help-seeking. To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \\texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment.

However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCSMCIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u5854\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u8be2-\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff08CIR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCSMCIR\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u5f81\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u7ea7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08MCoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\uff1b2\uff09\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570Q-Former\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u5854\u67b6\u6784\u786e\u4fdd\u4e00\u81f4\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\uff1b3\uff09\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f\u63d0\u5347CIR\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0cCSMCIR\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4e09\u91cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions.

However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification.

However, simulator outputs often exhibit systematic bias, while ground-truth measurements are costly and scarce.

We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares. This approach yields calibrated edge cost estimates even in data-scarce regimes. We establish finite-sample error bounds, translate estimation error into path-level suboptimality guarantees, and propose a computable, data-driven certificate that verifies near-optimality of a candidate route.

We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features.

We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity.

While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets.

Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively.

This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \\textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \\textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \\textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation. Overall, this work provides a critical evaluation of the role of reasoning in forensic audio deepfake analysis and its vulnerabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08ALMs\uff09\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6cd5\u533b\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u58f0\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8c03\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u65e2\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9632\u5fa1\u2018\u76fe\u724c\u2019\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u2018\u7a0e\u2019\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u9ad8\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8c03\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u58f0\u8b66\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u97f3\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08ADD\uff09\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08ALMs\uff09\u867d\u5f15\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u65e0\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6cd5\u533b\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u58f0\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u97f3\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165/\u8f93\u51fa\u903b\u8f91\u662f\u5426\u81ea\u6d3d\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8c03\uff08\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u77db\u76fe\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0ALMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u4e24\u6781\u5206\u5316\uff1a\u58f0\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u8d77\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f5c\u7528\uff08shield\uff09\uff0c\u5f31\u8005\u5219\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff08tax\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u5206\u7c7b\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u9ad8\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8c03\u4ecd\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u9884\u8b66\u4f2a\u9020\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u63d0\u5347ALMs\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e95\u5c42\u58f0\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5931\u8c03\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u97f3\u9891\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel \"Decompose-then-Action\" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faI2E\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684'\u5206\u89e3-\u6267\u884c'\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6765\u89e3\u6790\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u5c40\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u9690\u5f0f\u8026\u5408\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faI2E\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528Decomposer\u5c06\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c42\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684Vision-Language-Action Agent\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08Chain-of-Thought\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u89e3\u6790\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u57fa\u51c6I2E-Bench\u3002", "result": "\u5728I2E-Bench\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cI2E\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u53ca\u591a\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "I2E\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VideoLLM\uff09\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u2014\u2014\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff08MVP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa\u88ab\u906e\u853d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5206\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684VideoLLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u7ec6\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff08MVP\uff09\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u88ab\u906e\u853d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210MVP\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u914d\u5408\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0cMVP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "MVP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u9762\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u7684VideoLLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728TabPFN\u8fd9\u4e00\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5c42\u6982\u5ff5\u5177\u6709\u4e2d\u7b49\u4f46\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u2018\u7956\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u2019\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5373\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u6709\u5f3a\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6307\u6807\u2014\u2014\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff1b\u5728TabPFN\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5404\u795e\u7ecf\u5143-\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u7684\u6307\u6807\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u5355\u641c\u7d22\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f18\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0TabPFN\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5c42\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e2d\u7b49\u4f46\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ef\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u5ea6\u91cf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets.

This method referred to as Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning (GESCL) avoids forgetting of previous tasks by ensuring the stability of the CNN via a stability regularization term, which prevents filters detected as important for past tasks to deviate too much when learning a new task. On top of that, GESCL makes the network plastic via a plasticity regularization term that leverage the over-parameterization of CNNs to efficiently sparsify the network and tunes unimportant filters making them relevant for future tasks. Doing so, GESCL deals with significantly less parameters and computation compared to CL approaches that either dynamically expand the network or memorize past tasks' data.

To address this, we propose Agent-Dice, a parameter fusion framework based on directional consensus evaluation. Concretely, Agent-Dice disentangles knowledge updates through a two-stage process: geometric consensus filtering to prune conflicting gradients, and curvature-based importance weighting to amplify shared semantics. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes the validity of the proposed fusion scheme and offers insight into the origins of the stability-plasticity dilemma.

We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks.

However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.\n  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints.

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding.

Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics.

This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process.

Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency.

However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08B-PINN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7edd\u7f18\u6750\u6599\u8001\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027PINN\u53ca\u5176\u5b83\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8ePINN\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u7ba1\u7406\uff08PHM\uff09\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5145\u5206\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08B-PINN\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08BNN\uff09\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u7a7a\u8001\u5316\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5168\u9884\u6d4b\u540e\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7edd\u7f18\u8001\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5B-PINN\u76f8\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027PINN\u3001dropout-PINN\u53ca\u5176\u5b83B-PINN\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u8fd0\u7ef4\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRRE-PPO4Pred\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06RNN\u5185\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9762\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6539\u8fdbPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08PPO4Pred\uff09\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RNN\u53caTransformer\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRNN\u4ec5\u91c7\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u7b49\u540c\u5bf9\u5f85\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u548c\u9690\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRRE-PPO4Pred\uff1a(1) \u5f3a\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08RRE\uff09\uff0c\u5c06RNN\u5185\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aMDP\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u9690\u72b6\u6001\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\uff1b(2) \u9762\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6539\u8fdbPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08PPO4Pred\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Transformer\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff1b(3) RNN\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cRRE-PPO4Pred\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "RRE-PPO4Pred\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRNN\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\u5e8f\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones.

Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity.

However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories.

To address this challenge, we introduce eTracer, a plug-and-play framework that enables traceable text generation by grounding claims against contextual evidence.

Building on claim-level grounding results, eTracer not only enables users to precisely trace responses back to their contextual source but also quantifies response faithfulness, thereby enabling the verifiability and trustworthiness of generated responses. Experiments show that our claim-level grounding approach alleviates the limitations of conventional grounding methods in aligning generated statements with contextual sentence-level evidence, resulting in substantial improvements in overall grounding quality and user verification efficiency.

Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage.

However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

We introduce DisastQA, a large-scale benchmark of 3,000 rigorously verified questions (2,000 multiple-choice and 1,000 open-ended) spanning eight disaster types. The benchmark is constructed via a human-LLM collaboration pipeline with stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage. Models are evaluated under varying evidence conditions, from closed-book to noisy evidence integration, enabling separation of internal knowledge from reasoning under imperfect information. For open-ended QA, we propose a human-verified keypoint-based evaluation protocol emphasizing factual completeness over verbosity. Experiments with 20 models reveal substantial divergences from general-purpose leaderboards such as MMLU-Pro. While recent open-weight models approach proprietary systems in clean settings, performance degrades sharply under realistic noise, exposing critical reliability gaps for disaster response.

However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTreeAdv\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u7ec4\u57fa\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5982GRPO\uff09\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u3002TreeAdv\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec4 rollout \u7684\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027token\u3001\u5206\u652f\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4f18\u52bf\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u81f3\u5185\u90e8token\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u572810\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO/GSPO\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u751f\u6210token\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6GRPO\u5c06rollout\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6241\u5e73\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4ec5\u5206\u914d\u5355\u4e00\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u504f\u5411\u5197\u957f\u3001\u6d45\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u903b\u8f91\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "TreeAdv\u6784\u5efa\u7531\u591a\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u68ee\u6797\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027token\u5904\u5206\u53c9\u3001\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027token\u5904\u5171\u4eab\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574rollout\uff08\u6240\u6709\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\uff09\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6309\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u805a\u5408\u5e76\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u81f3\u5185\u90e8token\u6bb5\uff1b\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u9002\u914dGRPO\u3001GSPO\u7b49\u7ec4\u57fa\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cTreeAdv\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8aGRPO\u548cGSPO\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u751f\u6210token\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec4 rollout \u7684\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u91cd\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u957f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u57fa\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684token\u7ea7\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFocusUI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9patch\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684UI\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728UI\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u622a\u56fe\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u91ca\uff1b\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92UI\u65f6\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684UI\u63a5\u5730\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFocusUI\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efapatch\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eUI\u56fe\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5f97\u5206\u4ee5\u7b5b\u9009\u76f8\u5173\u4e14\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165PosPad\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5220\u9664\u8fde\u7eedtoken\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8a\u6807\u8bb0\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u5e76\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u672b\u5c3e\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aUI\u63a5\u5730\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aGUI\u4e13\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1bScreenSpot-Pro\u4e0aFocusUI-7B\u6bd4GUI-Actor-7B\u63d0\u53473.7%\uff1b\u4ec5\u4fdd\u755930%\u89c6\u89c9token\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d3.2%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.44\u500d\uff0cGPU\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u964d\u4f4e17%\u3002", "conclusion": "FocusUI\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86UI\u63a5\u5730\u4e2d\u7684token\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u7834\u574f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0e\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors.

However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring \"vision\" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination.

With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process.

Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \\textbf{E}lastic \\textbf{T}rust \\textbf{R}egions (\\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5f39\u6027\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\uff08ETR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u514b\u670dGRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u9759\u6001\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728AIME\u548cMATH\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\u574d\u584c\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u9759\u6001\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u540c\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5f02\u8d28\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u5feb\u901f\u71b5\u574d\u584c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f39\u6027\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\uff08ETR\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u5c42\u5f39\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5fae\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u6839\u636e\u4f18\u52bf\u5927\u5c0f\u52a8\u6001\u7f29\u653ePPO\u526a\u88c1\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5185\u65b9\u5dee\u9690\u5f0f\u4e3a\u5904\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u533a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIME\u548cMATH\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cETR\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u6301\u7eed\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u66f4\u5951\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u672c\u8d28\uff0cETR\u4e3aRLVR\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Pad\u00e9 neurons (Paons), inspired by Pad\u00e9 approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Pad\u00e9 approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers.

A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum.

Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faADEPT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u65e9\u9000\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0token\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u65e9\u9000\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u8df3\u8fc7\u5c42\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e9\u9000\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9996token\u6216prompt\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8df3\u8fc7\u5c42\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4ecd\u6210\u4e3a\u540e\u7eedtoken\u751f\u6210\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65e9\u9000\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADEPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94token\u7ea7\u65e9\u9000\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8df3\u8fc7\u5c42KV\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u8026\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u652f\u6301prefill\u4e0egeneration\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u65e9\u9000\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe25%\uff0c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u52a0\u901f4\u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534745%\u3002", "conclusion": "ADEPT\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3KV\u7f13\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u65e9\u9000\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faREACT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5982\u5f02\u5e38\u7269\u4f53\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03+\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5931\u771f\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5f52\u56e0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5957\u53d1\u5e03REACT-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\uff08T2V\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5374\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5982\u5f02\u5e38\u7269\u4f53\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREACT\u5e27\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u4e0e\u6210\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u805a\u7126\u6613\u5931\u771f\u5e27\uff1b\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03REACT-Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "REACT\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5931\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "REACT\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5931\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aT2V\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.\n  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGEM-2\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6982\u7387Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u72b6\u6001\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6781\u503c\u3001\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u3001\u9608\u503c\u8d85\u8d8a\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u62a5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u5148\u8fdbML\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u72b6\u6001\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6781\u503c\u3001\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u3001\u9608\u503c\u8d85\u8d8a\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u9700\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGEM-2\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u7403\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u76f4\u63a5\u884c\u52a8\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6982\u7387Transformer\uff1b\u91c7\u7528CRPS\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7ea62.75\u4ebf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4SOTA\u5feb20\u2013100\u500d\u3002", "result": "GEM-2\u5728\u9884\u62a5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e1a\u52a1\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\uff08NWP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u591a\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6216\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7684ML\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5728\u6b21\u5b63\u8282\u81f3\u5b63\u8282\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u6c14\u5019\u6001\uff1b\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u610f\u5916\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u9762\u5411\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8303\u5f0f\uff1bGEM-2\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem.

In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-\u03b2_\\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $\u03b2_\\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $\u03b2$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after.

A Close Look at DeepSeek-OCR", "comment": null, "summary": "DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: \"Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?\" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck. This study empirically defines DeepSeek-OCR's capability boundaries and offers essential insights for future optimizations of the vision-text compression paradigm.

Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence.

However, achieving both domain performance and cross-domain generalization remains challenging. Existing approaches typically restrict students to following a single golden rationale and treat different reasoning paths independently. Due to distinct inductive biases and intrinsic preferences, alongside the student's evolving capacity and reasoning preferences during training, a teacher's \"optimal\" rationale could act as out-of-distribution noise. This misalignment leads to a degeneration of the student's latent reasoning distribution, causing suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIND, a capability-adaptive framework that transitions distillation from passive mimicry to active cognitive construction. We synthesize diverse teacher perspectives through a novel \"Teaching Assistant\" network. By employing a Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration mechanism, this network utilizes inertia-filtered training loss to align supervision with the student's current adaptability, effectively enhancing performance while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history.

By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds.

By standardizing data splits, features, and evaluation metrics, our study provides a fair assessment of when current-generation QML models can match or exceed classical methods. Our results reveal that quantum approaches show performance gains when data structure and circuit design are well aligned. In directional classification, hybrid quantum neural networks surpass the parameter-matched ANN by \\textbf{+3.8 AUC} and \\textbf{+3.4 accuracy points} on \\texttt{AAPL} stock and by \\textbf{+4.9 AUC} and \\textbf{+3.6 accuracy points} on Turkish stock \\texttt{KCHOL}. In live trading, the QLSTM achieves higher risk-adjusted returns in \\textbf{two of four} S\\&P~500 regimes. For volatility forecasting, an angle-encoded QSVR attains the \\textbf{lowest QLIKE} on \\texttt{KCHOL} and remains within $\\sim$0.02-0.04 QLIKE of the best classical kernels on \\texttt{S\\&P~500} and \\texttt{AAPL}.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework for the automated synthesis of sophisticated, research-grade instructional data.

However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces.

Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u5e72\u51c0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\uff08\u5373\u7531\u81ea\u7136\u4f46\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u540e\u95e8\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e72\u51c0\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u533a\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u663e\u89e6\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u5f0f\u578b\u540e\u95e8\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u2018\u795e\u79d8\u8d2d\u7269\u2019\u5f0f\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u53ef\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u690d\u5165\u540e\u95e8\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7531\u5c11\u91cf\u5e72\u51c0\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u91cd\u70b9\u91c7\u7528\u7531\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u6267\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u751f\u6210\u6700\u5927\u5316\u504f\u79bb\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u8ddd\u79bb\u9608\u503c\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4e2d\u6bd2\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u79bb\u5e72\u51c0\u4e0e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u9762\u5bf9\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5177\u5907\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6d41\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u5ba1\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u53cd\u6f14\u6837\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1AI\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

LLM Source Preferences under Knowledge Conflicts", "comment": "Data and code: https://github.com/JaSchuste/llm-source-preference", "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) are more frequently used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, it is increasingly relevant to study their behavior under knowledge conflicts. Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media.

However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples.

Previous research has shown that they can be misused for generation of personalized disinformation in multiple languages. It has also been observed that personalization negatively affects detectability of machine-generated texts; however, this has been studied in the English language only. In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer.

For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios.

However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFALCON\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u611f\u77e5\u7684token\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u8f6e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08OSFL\uff09\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u8f6e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5904\u7406non-IID\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "FALCON\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42token\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u5408\u6210token\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e0a\u4f20\u5408\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u53ca\u672c\u5730\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFALCON\u5728\u591a\u79cdnon-IID\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18OSFL\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53479.58%\u3002", "conclusion": "FALCON\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86OSFL\u5728non-IID\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597AI\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength.

However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization.

Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faToTMNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5149\u7535\u5bb9\u79ef\u63cf\u8bb0\uff08rPPG\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528FFT\u52a0\u901f\u7684Toeplitz\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5e8f\u5217\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u4ec563k\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u5728UBFC-rPPG\u548cSCAMPS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u5fc3\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Toeplitz\u7ed3\u6784\u662frPPG\u4e2d\u66ff\u4ee3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6rPPG\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faToTMNet\uff1a\u91c7\u7528FFT\u52a0\u901f\u7684Toeplitz\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0eFFT\u5377\u79ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u95e8\u63a7\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u5e8f\u5377\u79ef\u4e0e\u95e8\u63a7\u5168\u5c40Toeplitz\u6df7\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728UBFC-rPPG\u4e0aMAE\u4e3a1.055 bpm\uff08Pearson=0.996\uff09\uff1b\u8de8\u57df\uff08SCAMPS\u2192UBFC-rPPG\uff09MAE\u4e3a1.582 bpm\uff08Pearson=0.994\uff09\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u8bc1\u5b9e\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347Toeplitz\u6df7\u5408\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "Toeplitz\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df7\u5408\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684rPPG\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5c40\u9650\u5728\u4e8e\u4ec5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

This paper takes the first step to investigate whether ALLMs inadvertently leak user privacy solely through acoustic voiceprints and introduces $\\textit{HearSay}$, a comprehensive benchmark constructed from over 22,000 real-world audio clips. To ensure data quality, the benchmark is meticulously curated through a rigorous pipeline involving automated profiling and human verification, guaranteeing that all privacy labels are grounded in factual records. Extensive experiments on $\\textit{HearSay}$ yield three critical findings: $\\textbf{Significant Privacy Leakage}$: ALLMs inherently extract private attributes from voiceprints, reaching 92.89% accuracy on gender and effectively profiling social attributes. $\\textbf{Insufficient Safety Mechanisms}$: Alarmingly, existing safeguards are severely inadequate; most models fail to refuse privacy-intruding requests, exhibiting near-zero refusal rates for physiological traits. $\\textbf{Reasoning Amplifies Risk}$: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning exacerbates privacy risks in capable models by uncovering deeper acoustic correlations.

In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions.

Decision trees induce rule-based, axis-aligned decision regions (finite unions of boxes), whereas shallow ReLU networks are typically trained as score models whose predictions are obtained by thresholding. We analyze the infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU class through the Radon total variation ($\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, which controls the geometric complexity of level sets.\n  We first show that the hard tree indicator $1_A$ has infinite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$. Moreover, two natural split-wise continuous surrogates--piecewise-linear ramp smoothing and sigmoidal (logistic) smoothing--also have infinite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ in dimensions $d>1$, while Gaussian convolution yields finite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ but with an explicit exponential dependence on $d$.\n  We then separate two goals that are often conflated: classification after thresholding (recovering the decision set) versus score learning (learning a calibrated score close to $1_A$). For classification, we construct a smooth barrier score $S_A$ with finite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ whose fixed threshold $\u03c4=1$ exactly recovers the box. Under a mild tube-mass condition near $\\partial A$, we prove an $L_1(P)$ calibration bound that decays polynomially in a sharpness parameter, along with an explicit $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ upper bound in terms of face measures.

Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent \"memory boxes\" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness.

Yu", "Xiao-Ming Wu"], "title": "FOREVER: Forgetting Curve-Inspired Memory Replay for Language Model Continual Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFOREVER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u5e45\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684'\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u95f4'\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u653e\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0eLLM\u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u56de\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6b65\u6570\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u800cLLM\u9057\u5fd8\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u827e\u5bbe\u6d69\u65af\u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56de\u653e\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFOREVER\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u5e45\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49'\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u95f4'\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56de\u653e\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u56de\u653e\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u548c0.6B\u81f313B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cFOREVER\u5747\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6f14\u5316\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u56de\u653e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6b65\u6570\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5951\u5408LLM\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347CL\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions.

We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8bb0\u5fc6PII\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u7ebf\u7d22\u62b5\u6297\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08CRM\uff09\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u4f4e\u7ebf\u7d22\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u544a\u7684PII\u6cc4\u9732\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PII\u6cc4\u9732\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5c06\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u5efa\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u2018\u8bb0\u5fc6\u2019\u7684\u8bef\u5224\uff1b\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u7ebf\u7d22\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u7d22\u62b5\u6297\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08CRM\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807PII\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bcd\u5f62/\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u91cd\u53e0\uff1b\u572832\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cd\u8bc4\u591a\u79cdPII\u91cd\u5efa\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u524d\u7f00-\u540e\u7f00\u8865\u5168\u3001\u5173\u8054\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u65e0\u7ebf\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u7ebf\u7d22\u540e\uff0c\u5404\u7c7b\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u65e0\u7ebf\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u771f\u9633\u6027\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\uff1b\u591a\u6570\u5148\u524d\u62a5\u9053\u7684PII\u6cc4\u9732\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u7ebf\u7d22\u9a71\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "conclusion": "PII\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0d\u5e94\u7b80\u5355\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1bCRM\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5fc5\u987b\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u7d22\u53ef\u63a7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only \"non-shared\" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate \"shared\" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable.

The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts.

We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning \"lives\" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e8658\u79cd\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u572810\u79cdTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316vs\u5b64\u7acb\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u5e76\u975e\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5c42\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff1a\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c5e\u6027\u65e9\u5cf0\u3001\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u665a\u5cf0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f55\u5904\u7f16\u7801\u5177\u6709\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5bf9\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5747\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u9010\u5c42\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790\uff08layer-wise probing\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d658\u79cd\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u300110\u79cdTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u542bencoder-only\u548cdecoder-only\u67b6\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u6bd4\u5b64\u7acb\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c42\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u6062\u590d\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u5747\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff1a\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u8f83\u6d45\u5c42\u8fbe\u5cf0\uff0c\u800c\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5728\u8f83\u6df1\u5c42\u8fbe\u5cf0\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u2018\u4f4d\u7f6e\u2019\u5e76\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u5f0f\uff09\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

However, the limited availability of radar sleep data poses challenges in building robust models that generalize across diverse cohorts and environments. This study proposes a novel deep transfer learning framework to enhance sleep stage classification using radar data. Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data. A domain adaptation approach employing adversarial learning was utilized to bridge the knowledge gap between PSG and radar signals. Validation was performed on a radar dataset of 47 older adults (mean age: 71.2), including 18 participants with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Results: The proposed network structure achieves an accuracy of 79.5% with a Kappa value of 0.65 when classifying wakefulness, rapid eye movement, light sleep and deep sleep. Experimental results confirm that our deep transfer learning approach significantly enhances automatic sleep staging performance in the target domain. Conclusion: This method effectively addresses challenges associated with data variability and limited sample size, substantially improving the reliability of automatic sleep staging models, especially in contexts where radar data is limited. Significance: The findings underscore the viability of UWB radar as a nonintrusive, forward-looking sleep assessment tool that could significantly benefit care for older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\u96f7\u8fbe\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u5bfc\u7761\u7720\u56fe\uff08PSG\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u7761\u7720\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u738779.5%\uff0cKappa=0.65\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u53ca\u65e9\u671f\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\u96f7\u8fbe\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u611f\u5c45\u5bb6\u7761\u7720\u76d1\u6d4b\u524d\u666f\u5e7f\u9614\uff0c\u4f46\u96f7\u8fbe\u7761\u7720\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u4eba\u7fa4\u548c\u73af\u5883\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21PSG\u6570\u636e\u548c\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f25\u5408PSG\u4e0e\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u572847\u540d\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\uff08\u542b18\u4f8b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u524d\u671f\u6216\u8f7b\u5ea6\u60a3\u8005\uff09\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c9\u9192\u3001REM\u3001\u6d45\u7761\u3001\u6df1\u7761\u56db\u7c7b\u5206\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u738779.5%\uff0cKappa\u7cfb\u65700.65\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u96f7\u8fbe\u7761\u7720\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5c11\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u65e0\u611f\u957f\u671f\u7761\u7720\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols.

We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available.

While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show SPAE consistently improves accuracy while substantially reducing response length, outperforming strong RL baselines and recent efficient reasoning and token-level advantage estimation methods.

Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training.

We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity.

However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTabTrim\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u526a\u679d\u4ece\u987a\u5e8f\u4fee\u8ba2\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u9ec4\u91d1\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u4fee\u8ba2\uff0c\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b54\u6848\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "TabTrim\u901a\u8fc7\u9ec4\u91d1SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5b50\u8868\u6784\u5efa\u9ec4\u91d1\u526a\u679d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u5668\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4f7f\u9010\u6b65\u526a\u679d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u8be5\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u526a\u679d\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u5b50\u8868\u3002", "result": "TabTrim\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1aTabTrim-8B\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe73.5%\uff0c\u8f83\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53473.2%\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dWikiTQ\u8fbe79.4%\uff0cTableBench\u8fbe61.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "TabTrim\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9ec4\u91d1\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5e73\u884c\u641c\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u526a\u679d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We study CPT as a knowledge learning process rather than a solely optimization problem. We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08CPT\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u540e\u8005\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5148\u9a8c\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u4e14\u5bfc\u81f4\u57df\u5916\u80fd\u529b\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u901a\u8def\u5feb\u901f\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7a84\u7a97\u53e3\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u505c\u6b62\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CPT\u5b9e\u8df5\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u7b80\u5355\u89c6\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u523b\u753b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53d7\u63a7\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6587\u6863\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bca\u65ad\u63a2\u9488\u5d4c\u5165CPT\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\uff08epoch-level\uff09\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u57df\u5916\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b66\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u7535\u8def\u5206\u6790\u63a2\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u635f\u5931\u5355\u8c03\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u975e\u5355\u8c03\uff1b\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u96be\u4ee5\u5de9\u56fa\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5148\u524d\u63a5\u89e6\uff1b\u57df\u5916\u80fd\u529b\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u5373\u5f00\u59cb\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7535\u8def\u5728\u5404\u8f6e\u6b21\u95f4\u5feb\u901f\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u7a97\u53e3\u72ed\u7a84\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "CPT\u4e2d\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e94\u6452\u5f03\u5355\u4e00\u4f9d\u8d56\u635f\u5931\u7684\u505c\u6b62\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8f6c\u800c\u4f9d\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data.

These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \\num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation.

Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers and heuristic methods exist, but they are less grounded in codebase context and harder to interpret. To this end, we explore Agentic Rubrics: an expert agent interacts with the repository to create a context-grounded rubric checklist, and candidate patches are then scored against it without requiring test execution. On SWE-Bench Verified under parallel TTS evaluation, Agentic Rubrics achieve a score of 54.2% on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and 40.6% on Qwen3-32B, with at least a +3.5 percentage-point gain over the strongest baseline in our comparison set. We further analyze rubric behavior, showing that rubric scores are consistent with ground-truth tests while also flagging issues that tests do not capture. Our ablations show that agentic context gathering is essential for producing codebase-specific, unambiguous criteria. Together, these results suggest that Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal for SWE agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAgentic Rubrics\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6e05\u5355\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u6267\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u73af\u5883\u914d\u7f6e\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982\u8865\u4e01\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u652f\u6301\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1Agentic Rubrics\uff1a\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u4ed3\u5e93\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6e05\u5355\uff0c\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6e05\u5355\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u8865\u4e01\u6253\u5206\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fd0\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u5e76\u5728SWE-Bench Verified\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e76\u884cTest-Time Scaling\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWE-Bench Verified\u4e0a\uff0cAgentic Rubrics\u5728Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B\u548cQwen3-32B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523054.2%\u548c40.6%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8f83\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c113.5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u65e2\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "Agentic Rubrics\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91c7\u96c6\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7279\u5f02\u3001\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards.

By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy.

While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks.

While ensuring adherence to these explicit constraints is critical, existing safety research primarily focuses on implicit social norms or text-only settings, overlooking the complexities of multimodal documents. In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints.

Rather than relying on scalar rewards, VAF issues structured natural-language critiques; these guide the generator toward more sophisticated evasion attempts, compelling the detector to adapt and improve.

In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment.

We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language judges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpeakerSleuth\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LALMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5224\u65ad\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LALMs\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u6587\u672c\u3001\u8f7b\u58f0\u5b66\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u58f0\u5b66\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LALMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5224\u636e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u5176\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5224\u65ad\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaSpeakerSleuth\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u30011818\u4e2a\u7ecf\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u97f3\uff09\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u58f0\u5b66\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u5bf99\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41LALMs\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "LALMs\u666e\u904d\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u58f0\u5b66\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1a\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5bbd\u677e\uff1b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u8bed\u53e5\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4ed6\u4eba\u8bdd\u8bed\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u660e\u663e\u6027\u522b\u5207\u6362\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u97f3\u9891\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5177\u5907\u57fa\u7840\u58f0\u5b66\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LALMs\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u2014\u2014\u4f18\u5148\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u58f0\u5b66\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u5224\u636e\u6240\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models.

To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life.

While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08MPO\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u5982\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5404\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u89c6\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u6587\u672c\u5757\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u6307\u4ee4\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u81a8\u80c0\uff1b\u800c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u53c8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff08MPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6bb5\uff08\u5982\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6279\u8bc4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5404\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u91cd\u6574\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u5728ARC-Challenge\u548cMMLU\u4e24\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct\u4e0eMistral-7B-Instruct\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMPO\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u8c03\u4f18\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u53caTextGrad\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u6539\u53d8\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u5206\u6bb5\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Based on this design, we develop an enhanced distillation-based reasoning framework that explicitly regulates intermediate reasoning steps, resulting in more reliable predictions. We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple public benchmarks using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3.

While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0b\u7684\u5c42\u4f20\u5bfc\uff08layer conductance\uff09\u5206\u6790\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5404\u5c42\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8fd1\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u51cf\u5f31\u7684\u9996\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u504f\u597d\u5b9e\u8bcd\u3001\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u4e27\u5931\u8bcd\u6027\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u672a\u5265\u79bb\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0b\u7684\u5c42\u4f20\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u5c42\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u7ea7\u522b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u6253\u4e71\u7b49\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u5177\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u5448\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8fd1\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u9996\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5f31\uff1b\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u663e\u8457\u504f\u597d\u5b9e\u8bcd\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u8be5\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8bcd\u6027\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u89e3\u8026\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models.

However, they still make mistakes, and these mistakes are often repeated across related queries. Natural language explanations can help correct these errors, but collecting them at scale may be infeasible, particularly in domains where expert annotators are required. To address this issue, we introduce FLEx ($\\textbf{F}$ew-shot $\\textbf{L}$anguage $\\textbf{Ex}$planations), a method for improving model behavior using a small number of explanatory examples. FLEx selects representative model errors using embedding-based clustering, verifies that the associated explanations correct those errors, and summarizes them into a prompt prefix that is prepended at inference-time. This summary guides the model to avoid similar errors on new inputs, without modifying model weights. We evaluate FLEx on CounterBench, GSM8K, and ReasonIF. We find that FLEx consistently outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across all three datasets and reduces up to 83\\% of CoT's remaining errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFLEx\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u793a\u4f8b\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u805a\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u91ca\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5e38\u91cd\u590d\u72af\u9519\uff1b\u4eba\u5de5\u6536\u96c6\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "FLEx\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u9009\u53d6\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\uff1b2\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u5e94\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u5426\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u91ca\u603b\u7ed3\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9884\u7f6e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u907f\u514d\u540c\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e0d\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728CounterBench\u3001GSM8K\u548cReasonIF\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFLEx\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11CoT\u5269\u4f59\u9519\u8bef\u768483%\u3002", "conclusion": "FLEx\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

RFC Bench operates at the paragraph level and captures the contextual complexity of financial news where meaning emerges from dispersed cues. The benchmark defines two complementary tasks: reference free misinformation detection and comparison based diagnosis using paired original perturbed inputs. Experiments reveal a consistent pattern: performance is substantially stronger when comparative context is available, while reference free settings expose significant weaknesses, including unstable predictions and elevated invalid outputs. These results indicate that current models struggle to maintain coherent belief states without external grounding.
