Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuralSSD是一种基于神经Galerkin方法的新型3D隐式曲面重建技术，通过引入新的能量方程和卷积网络，实现了从点云数据中高精度、稳定地重建表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式场参数化方法缺乏确保表面与输入点云紧密贴合的显式机制，导致重建精度不足。

Method: 提出一种基于神经Galerkin方法的求解器NeuralSSD，设计新的能量方程以平衡点云信息的可靠性，并采用新型三维卷积网络学习空间特征以优化重建结果。

Result: 在ShapeNet和Matterport等多个挑战性数据集上验证了NeuralSSD的有效性，重建精度和泛化能力均达到当前最优水平。

Conclusion: NeuralSSD能有效提升点云到隐式曲面的重建质量，具备良好的准确性、稳定性与泛化性能，适用于复杂真实场景的三维重建任务。

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D城市数据虽日益丰富，但因计算瓶颈和交互复杂性，大规模探索仍具挑战，尤其是遮挡严重和需手动调整视角的问题。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升3D城市数据探索效率，适用于实际城市分析场景，具备良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Despite the growing availability of 3D urban datasets, extracting insights remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the complexity of interacting with data. In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts. Results show its effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

### [3] [nuCarla: A nuScenes-Style Bird's-Eye View Perception Dataset for CARLA Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13744)
*Zhijie Qiao,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nuCarla是一个大规模、兼容nuScenes格式的鸟瞰图感知数据集，基于CARLA仿真器构建，专为闭环端到端自动驾驶研发设计，支持高性能BEV模型训练与部署，推动安全可靠的自动驾驶研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实世界采集的数据集多为非交互式，主要支持开环学习，难以满足闭环端到端自动驾驶对交互环境和中间表征（如BEV特征）学习的需求，导致闭环模型性能落后于规则基线。

Method: 在CARLA仿真器中构建nuScenes风格的大规模BEV感知数据集nuCarla，确保其格式兼容性、类分布均衡性，并支持直接用于闭环仿真；同时提供高性能BEV主干网络作为基准。

Result: nuCarla实现了与nuScenes相当的数据规模，具备更好的类别平衡性，支持无缝迁移真实世界的感知模型，并在检测任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: nuCarla为闭环端到端自动驾驶提供了标准化、可扩展的数据与模型开源基准，显著加速了该领域的研发进程，促进了安全感知的自动驾驶技术发展。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving heavily relies on closed-loop simulation, where perception, planning, and control are jointly trained and evaluated in interactive environments. Yet, most existing datasets are collected from the real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning while offering limited value for closed-loop testing. Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results. By providing both data and models as open benchmarks, nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

### [4] [Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13775)
*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于缓解开集识别中因类间重叠导致的过置信问题的框架，通过扰动不确定性估计和基于学习的未知类检测模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开集识别中，未知样本与已知类语义相似时易导致特征空间中的类间重叠，引发模型对未知样本产生过高的置信度，从而错误分类，影响开集识别效果。

Method: 提出包含两个组件的框架：基于扰动的不确定性估计模块，通过可控参数扰动生成多样化预测以量化预测不确定性；两阶段的基于学习的未知类检测模块，利用估计的不确定性增强已知与未知类之间的判别能力。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，该框架在开集识别任务中优于现有的OSR方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效缓解由类间重叠引起的过置信问题，显著提升开集识别性能。

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

### [5] [Temporal Object-Aware Vision Transformer for Few-Shot Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13784)
*Yogesh Kumar,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的少样本视频目标检测方法，通过选择性传播高置信度特征实现高效、鲁棒的时序一致性，无需依赖复杂的物体轨迹提议，在多个数据集上显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统检测方法在少样本情况下难以泛化以及现有方法依赖复杂区域提议和难以保持时序一致性的局限。

Method: 设计了一种基于高置信度特征选择传播的时序建模机制，结合少样本训练的检测与分类头，实现无需显式物体管生成的时序一致性优化。

Result: 在5-shot设置下，AP指标在FSVOD-500、FSYTV-40、VidOR和VidVRD数据集上分别提升3.7%、5.3%、4.3%和4.5%，并在1-shot、3-shot和10-shot设置下均表现出性能增益。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效提升了少样本视频目标检测的准确性和时序一致性，且不依赖复杂的区域提议，具有良好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于流匹配的多模态图像融合方法，通过概率传输和伪标签选择提升采样效率与融合质量，并引入融合精炼模块和持续学习机制，在多任务场景下实现高效、轻量且鲁棒的图像融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务特定模型导致成本高、扩展性差，生成式方法虽统一建模但推理慢，且缺乏高质量真值监督。

Method: 将图像融合建模为从源模态到融合图像分布的概率传输，采用流匹配提升采样效率；利用多个SOTA模型输出作为先验，通过任务感知选择函数选取可靠伪标签；设计Fusion Refiner模块分解并增强退化成分；结合弹性权重固化和经验回放实现多任务持续学习。

Result: 在多种融合任务上达到竞争性性能，显著提升采样效率，模型轻量，支持多任务持续学习。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证高质量融合的同时大幅提高推理速度和模型可扩展性，为多模态图像融合提供了一种高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.

### [7] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需轨迹的两阶段实时碰撞检测框架，利用扩散模型生成道路段地图并检测异常，有效提升了交通安全管理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为克服传统方法在车辆跟踪和轨迹获取上的局限性，需开发一种不依赖精确轨迹数据的高效实时碰撞检测方法。

Method: 提出Mapfusion模型，采用基于扩散的两阶段框架：第一阶段通过引入噪声并逐步去噪生成合理的未来道路段地图，结合ControlNet增强背景上下文控制；第二阶段通过比较实际监测图与生成图进行碰撞检测。

Result: 模型在真实世界碰撞数据上表现良好，能准确生成非碰撞状态下的道路段演化图，并有效识别异常事件，对不同采样间隔具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需精确车辆轨迹即可实现高精度碰撞检测，为智能交通系统中的主动安全策略提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

### [8] [Synergizing Multigrid Algorithms with Vision Transformer: A Novel Approach to Enhance the Seismic Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13800)
*Huiwen Wu,Shuo Zhang,Yi Liu,Hongbin Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验表明所提方法在效率和有效性上优于现有方法，能更好捕捉地震数据的多层次结构特征。

Conclusion: 数据编码与训练策略应结合地震数据的高低频特性，所提出的ADATG框架显著提升了地震基础模型的预训练性能。

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于面部微动态分析的被动式痴呆筛查方法，利用无脚本、自然环境下的短视频进行语言无关的早期神经认知变化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资源多依赖语音或结构化访谈，限制了在临床外的应用，并将预测结果与语言和转录耦合；希望实现无需主动干预、跨设备、话题和文化的可扩展筛查。

Method: 通过稳定面部信号，提取眨眼、口颌运动、注视变异性、头部微调等时间序列特征，转化为可解释的微动态时序数据，平滑后汇总为片段级统计特征；采用轻量级浅层分类器，基于运动在各通道的分布（活动混合）进行预测。

Result: 构建了新的真实场景数据集YT DemTalk（300个视频片段，150例痴呆自报者，150例对照），消融实验显示注视不稳定性与口颌动态最具信息量，在该数据集上达到AUROC 0.953、AP 0.961、F1-score 0.851、准确率0.857。

Conclusion: 仅凭非语言的面部时间微动态即可高效实现痴呆筛查，所提方法适用于自然场景下的大规模被动监测，具有良好的跨文化与设备适应潜力。

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

*Xinxin Liu,Zhaopan Xu,Kai Wang,Yong Jae Lee,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Gen-ViRe，首个面向视频生成模型的生成式视觉推理基准，旨在评估模型在多步规划、算法逻辑和抽象模式推断等方面的链式帧（CoF）推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型虽可作为世界模拟器进行CoF推理，但缺乏评估其核心认知能力的基准，限制了对模型推理深度的理解与改进。

Method: 基于认知科学设计六维认知框架，涵盖24个子任务，采用多源数据构建、最小提示协议和混合视觉语言模型辅助评估方法。

Result: 实验表明当前最先进的模型在视觉质量与实际推理深度之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe为评估视频模型的推理能力提供了系统化基准，推动真正具备物理感知与推理能力的世界模拟器发展。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [11] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于排序的损失函数（RSPose）以解决热图人体姿态估计中的三个主要问题，显著提升mAP性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有热图损失函数（如MSE）未针对关键点定位优化，存在像素偏差惩罚不均衡、类别与空间不平衡以及损失函数与评估指标（mAP）不一致的问题。

Method: 设计了与mAP评估指标对齐的排序损失函数，增强置信度分数与定位质量之间的相关性，适用于一维和二维热图模型。

Result: 在COCO、CrowdPose和MPII数据集上验证有效性，RSPose在COCO-val集上达到79.9 mAP（ViTPose-H），并使SimCC ResNet-50提升1.5 AP至73.6 AP。

Conclusion: 所提出的排序损失函数更契合姿态估计任务的评估目标，显著提升定位精度和实例选择效果，是首个与mAP对齐的损失方法。

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

### [12] [Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863)
*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了碰撞声音源分割（CS3）的新任务，旨在根据音频在视频帧中分割出产生碰撞声的物体，利用基础模型（如CLIP和SAM2）结合自我中心线索，在两个新基准EPIC-CS3和Ego4D-CS3上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类多感官感知能力启发，希望实现从碰撞声音中识别并分割出对应的视觉物体，尤其是在自我中心视频中因场景复杂而具挑战性的情况下。

Method: 提出一种弱监督的音频条件分割方法，结合基础模型CLIP和SAM2，并引入自我中心线索（如手中物体）来定位可能的碰撞声源物体。

Result: 在新构建的EPIC-CS3和Ego4D-CS3两个基准上，mIoU指标分别超越竞争基线3倍和4.7倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效应对CS3任务中的多感官对齐挑战，验证了结合音频、视觉与自我中心线索进行弱监督分割的潜力。

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

*Changyang Li,Xuejian Ma,Lixiang Liu,Zhan Li,Qingan Yan,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于几何表示回归（GRR）的新范式，通过解耦相机旋转与平移的预测，显式回归三维几何表示以实现更鲁棒的绝对位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有绝对位姿回归（APR）方法常作为黑箱模型，缺乏对3D场景几何的理解，易过拟合训练视角，泛化能力差。

Method: 受新视角合成启发，将APR重构为其逆过程——从图像直接回归3D几何表示；模型在世界坐标系下分别预测光线方向（用于旋转估计）和对应点图（用于平移估计），并通过可微确定性求解器恢复6-DoF位姿。

Result: 在7-Scenes和Cambridge Landmarks数据集上达到SOTA性能，验证了该方法在泛化性和准确性上的优势。

Conclusion: 通过引入几何先验并显式解耦旋转与平移预测，GRR为绝对位姿估计提供了更稳健、可解释且泛化性强的新路径。

Abstract: Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP和现有医学文本编码器受限于输入长度和语义理解能力，难以有效处理长且信息密集的放射学报告。

Method: 将CLIP的文本编码器替换为基于大语言模型的嵌入模块（如Qwen3-Embedding），并引入可学习提示来增强跨模态对齐。

Result: QwenCLIP在多个放射学基准上显著提升了图文匹配和下游任务性能，能够更好地捕捉长临床文本的语义。

Conclusion: 通过结合大语言模型的强表示能力和扩展上下文窗口，QwenCLIP有效解决了传统模型在医学长文本处理中的局限性，推动了医学视觉-语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Wxy-24/QwenCLIP.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

Abstract: The population loss of trained deep neural networks often exhibits power law scaling with the size of the training dataset, guiding significant performance advancements in deep learning applications. In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data. Overall, this work provides insights into the understanding of segmentation scalability and topological variation impact in medical imaging, thereby leading to more efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs.

Conclusion: Uni-Hema实现了跨疾病的多任务、多模态统一分析，为数字血液病理学建立了新标准。

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频模型在时间真实性方面表现不足，而主流评估指标多关注空间外观，对运动敏感性有限。因此需要一种能够有效诊断生成视频中运动缺陷的新方法。

Method: 利用H.264和HEVC等编码标准提取的运动矢量（MV），通过KL、JS和Wasserstein散度比较真实与生成视频的MV统计特性；同时探索MV-RGB融合策略以增强判别模型的时间推理能力。

Result: 在GenVidBench数据集上的实验表明：Pika和SVD在熵散度上最接近真实视频，VC2和Text2Video-Zero在MV-sum统计上表现更好，CogVideo偏差最大；可视化揭示了中心偏置、稀疏流动和网格伪影；MV-RGB融合使ResNet、I3D等模型在真假视频分类任务中准确率最高达99.0%。

Conclusion: 压缩域中的运动矢量是一种有效的时序信号，可用于诊断生成视频的运动缺陷并增强判别模型的时间建模能力，为视频生成与评估提供了新的分析视角和实用工具。

Abstract: Temporal realism remains a central weakness of current generative video models, as most evaluation metrics prioritize spatial appearance and offer limited sensitivity to motion. We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

Conclusion: SAE-MCVT是首个适用于城市规模部署的可扩展实时MCVT框架，兼顾性能与效率。

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

Abstract: Following road safety norms is non-negotiable not only for humans but also for the AI systems that govern autonomous vehicles. In this work, we evaluate how well multi-modal large language models (LLMs) understand road safety concepts, specifically through schematic and illustrative representations. We curate a pilot dataset of images depicting traffic signs and road-safety norms sourced from school text books and use it to evaluate models capabilities in a zero-shot setting. Our preliminary results show that these models struggle with safety reasoning and reveal gaps between human learning and model interpretation. We further provide an analysis of these performance gaps for future research.

Conclusion: CuRPO通过课程设计有效缓解了复杂推理链带来的性能退化问题，为视觉定位中的推理链优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据高效且领域无关的预训练提供了新路径，表明抽象计算先验可有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

Abstract: Purpose: Echocardiographic interpretation requires video-level reasoning and guideline-based measurement analysis, which current deep learning models for cardiac ultrasound do not support. We present EchoAgent, a framework that enables structured, interpretable automation for this domain. Methods: EchoAgent orchestrates specialized vision tools under Large Language Model (LLM) control to perform temporal localization, spatial measurement, and clinical interpretation. A key contribution is a measurement-feasibility prediction model that determines whether anatomical structures are reliably measurable in each frame, enabling autonomous tool selection. We curated a benchmark of diverse, clinically validated video-query pairs for evaluation. Results: EchoAgent achieves accurate, interpretable results despite added complexity of spatiotemporal video analysis. Outputs are grounded in visual evidence and clinical guidelines, supporting transparency and traceability. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic, guideline-aligned reasoning for echocardiographic video analysis, enabled by task-specific tools and full video-level automation. EchoAgent sets a new direction for trustworthy AI in cardiac ultrasound.

*Kumar Ashutosh,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CrossTrainer方法，通过跨运动技能评估的可迁移视频表示，实现对动作质量的评分与反馈生成，在跨域和同域场景下均显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型局限于单一运动项目，依赖大量专家标注，难以扩展到长尾运动项目，因此需要可迁移的技能评估表示方法以降低监督成本。

Method: 提出CrossTrainer方法，自动发现超越特定运动的通用技能属性（如平衡、控制、手部位置），并训练多模态语言模型生成动作反馈及熟练度评级。

Result: 在多个数据集的跨运动和同运动设置下验证，相对现有方法性能提升高达60%。

Conclusion: 通过抽象人类技能中共有的行为特征，所提出的视频表示具有更强的泛化能力，显著提升了多模态大模型在技能评估任务中的表现。

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于卷积字典特征解耦的双提示专家网络（CD-DPE），用于多对比度MRI超分辨率，有效分离和融合跨对比与同对比特征，显著提升重建质量与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多对比度MRI超分辨率中，由于不同模态间的固有对比度差异，难以有效利用参考图像纹理信息，导致特征融合不充分。

Method: 提出卷积字典特征解耦模块（CD-FDM）迭代分离跨对比和同对比特征，并设计双提示特征融合专家模块（DP-FFEM），通过频率提示和自适应路由提示实现精准特征选择与融合。

Result: 在公开数据集上实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，能更好重建细节；在未见数据集上也表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CD-DPE通过特征解耦与双提示融合机制，有效解决了多对比度MRI超分辨率中的特征干扰与融合难题，具有优异的性能和临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) super-resolution intends to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) scans by leveraging structural information present in HR reference images acquired with different contrasts. This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

*Jack Qin,Zhitao Wang,Yinan Zheng,Keyu Chen,Yang Zhou,Yuanxin Zhong,Siyuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD) 的新框架，利用视觉-语言模型（VLM）增强端到端自动驾驶系统的训练，通过引入RiskHead模块将因果风险估计蒸馏到鸟瞰图（BEV）特征中，生成可解释的风险注意力图，从而提升模型在复杂动态环境中的泛化能力、感知与规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统在面对未见过的场景或不同传感器配置时泛化能力有限，现有基于VLM的方法存在系统不一致或计算开销过大的问题。

Method: 提出RSD框架，设计RiskHead插件模块，从VLM中提取因果风险语义，并将其蒸馏到BEV特征中，生成风险注意力图，以增强端到端自动驾驶骨干网络的训练。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准上验证了RSD的有效性，显著提升了感知和规划能力，增强了对空间边界和高风险物体的处理表现。

Conclusion: RSD通过聚焦风险注意力，有效提升了自动驾驶系统的泛化能力和安全性，且更贴近人类驾驶行为，为VLM与E2E系统的结合提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

TL;DR: RISE 是首个基于单静态雷达的室内场景理解系统，利用多径反射提升几何推理能力，实现高精度布局重建和物体检测，同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光学传感器存在遮挡和隐私问题，而毫米波雷达虽能穿透障碍并保护隐私，但空间分辨率低，难以进行可靠的几何推理。

Method: 提出 Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement 方法，建模到达角和出发角以恢复次级反射；采用仿真到现实的分层扩散框架，将碎片化雷达响应转化为完整布局重建与物体检测。

Result: 在5万帧真实轨迹数据上构建了首个大规模雷达室内理解基准；布局重建的 Chamfer Distance 降低60%（低至16cm），首次实现毫米波雷达的物体检测，IoU 达58%。

Conclusion: RISE 为基于单静态雷达的几何感知与隐私保护室内场景理解提供了新基础。

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

Motivation: 视觉几何Transformer在3D感知和重建中计算开销大，难以实现实时应用，亟需高效的推理加速方法。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级置信度预测器，根据令牌的不确定性进行排序，并选择性地合并低置信度令牌，从而减少计算量并保持空间覆盖。

Result: 在VGGT和MapAnything上分别实现了最高11.3倍和7.2倍的加速，且性能未下降，加速效果随序列长度增加而提升。

Conclusion: Co-Me是一种通用、高效且无需微调的Token合并策略，显著提升了视觉几何Transformer的推理效率，推动其在实时场景中的应用。

Abstract: We propose Confidence-Guided Token Merging (Co-Me), an acceleration mechanism for visual geometric transformers without retraining or finetuning the base model. Co-Me distilled a light-weight confidence predictor to rank tokens by uncertainty and selectively merge low-confidence ones, effectively reducing computation while maintaining spatial coverage. Compared to similarity-based merging or pruning, the confidence signal in Co-Me reliably indicates regions emphasized by the transformer, enabling substantial acceleration without degrading performance. Co-Me applies seamlessly to various multi-view and streaming visual geometric transformers, achieving speedups that scale with sequence length. When applied to VGGT and MapAnything, Co-Me achieves up to $11.3\times$ and $7.2\times$ speedup, making visual geometric transformers practical for real-time 3D perception and reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化系统在缺乏解剖平面方向元数据时难以准确分析MRI图像，导致数据整合困难和诊断性能下降。

Method: 采用2.5D上下文感知模型，利用多切片信息进行训练，结合3D序列和2D静态图像输入，并引入基于不确定性的门控策略以增强下游任务性能。

Result: 2.5D模型达到99.49%的平面分类准确率，较2D模型（98.74%）错误减少60%；在脑肿瘤检测中，结合元数据使准确率从97.0%提升至98.0%，误诊减少33.3%。

Conclusion: 2.5D上下文信息对准确推断MRI平面方向至关重要，生成的元数据可有效提升临床诊断模型性能，具备实际应用与推广价值。

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

TL;DR: 提出LINGUAL框架，利用自然语言指令指导医学图像分割任务，在保持或提升性能的同时，减少约80%的标注时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习在医学图像分割中仍需大量人工标注，边界模糊且耗时费力，亟需降低专家认知负担和标注成本。

Method: 通过上下文学习将专家的自然语言指令转化为可执行程序，自动完成相应子任务，实现无需人工干预的语言引导分割框架LINGUAL。

Result: 在主动域适应任务中，LINGUAL达到或优于传统主动学习方法的性能，同时估计标注时间减少约80%。

Conclusion: LINGUAL有效降低了医学图像分割中的标注成本与认知负荷，展示了语言指导在主动学习中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的AI生成图像检测方法WaRPAD，利用自监督模型对高频频域扰动和裁剪缩放增强的鲁棒性，在多种数据集和生成模型上表现出色且具有强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自监督模型通过如RandomResizedCrop等增强方式训练，能够学习到跨分辨率的一致性表示，这启发作者探索不依赖特定数据训练、适用于多种生成图像的通用检测方法。

Method: 提出WaRPAD算法：首先通过Haar小波分解提取高频方向扰动，定义基础分数函数来衡量图像嵌入对这些扰动的敏感性；然后通过将图像缩放并分割为多个patch，模拟裁剪增强的鲁棒性，最后对所有patch的基础分数进行平均作为最终检测分数。

Result: 在包含多种分辨率和领域的实际数据集以及23种不同生成模型生成的图像上验证了WaRPAD的有效性，该方法性能优越且对测试时的损坏具有强鲁棒性，并可广泛应用于不同的自监督模型。

Conclusion: WaRPAD是一种通用、无需训练的AI生成图像检测方法，利用自监督模型固有的不变性特性，实现了跨模型和跨域的稳定检测性能。

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

Conclusion: FashionMAC通过消除变形步骤和引入RADA机制，在 garment-centric 时尚图像生成任务中实现了更高质量和更强的可控性，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

Result: SCAR在指令编辑和可控生成任务上实现了更优的视觉保真度和语义一致性，优于先前的自回归方法，同时保持良好可控性。

Conclusion: SCAR有效提升了自回归模型在图像编辑中的语义控制能力，兼具高效性和通用性，为AR模型在多模态系统中的应用提供了更好支持。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CORE的新型视觉token压缩范式，通过引入基于对象中心的表示和质心引导排序机制，在显著提升大视觉语言模型效率的同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token压缩方法缺乏高层语义理解，导致合并效果不佳、信息冗余或上下文丢失，且随着图像分辨率增加，计算和内存成本急剧上升。

Method: CORE利用高效的分割解码器生成对象掩码作为高层语义先验，指导视觉token的合并，并采用新颖的质心引导排序机制恢复合并后token的空间顺序，保留关键位置信息。

Result: 实验表明，CORE在六个权威基准上达到了固定压缩率下的最先进水平，在自适应压缩场景中也实现了显著的效率提升；即使仅保留2.2%的视觉token，仍能维持97.4%的基线性能。

Conclusion: CORE证明了以对象为中心的表示在高效且有效的LVLM处理中的优越性，为高分辨率视觉语言模型的压缩提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中受限于对大规模标注数据的依赖，而医学领域尤其是罕见病的数据获取困难且标注成本高，亟需一种无需大量标注数据即可构建任务特定模型的新方法。

Method: 提出语义引导参数合成器（SGPS），利用大规模预训练生成引擎，以极少的多模态输入（如单张图像和临床文本描述）直接生成轻量级分类器（如EfficientNet-V2）的全部参数，实现无需训练或微调的即时推理。

Result: 在ISIC 2018皮肤病变数据集和自建罕见病数据集上的少样本分类任务中，SGPS在1-shot和5-shot等极低数据条件下显著优于先进的少样本和零样本学习方法，达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SGPS为数据极度稀缺场景下的AI诊断工具快速开发与部署提供了可行路径，尤其有望推动罕见病智能诊断的发展。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的全自动管道，用于在三维CT扫描中测量肩关节盂骨丢失，具有高一致性和临床可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手动和半自动方法耗时且存在观察者间变异，需要一种更可靠、高效的测量肩关节盂骨丢失的方法以辅助手术规划。

Method: 开发了一个多阶段深度学习算法，包括U-Net进行分割、第二网络预测解剖标志点，结合主成分分析（PCA）、投影和圆拟合计算骨丢失百分比。

Result: 自动化测量与专家共识读数高度一致（ICC 0.84 vs 0.78），在低/高骨丢失亚组中表现更优，分类召回率良好且无严重误分类。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种高效、可靠的术前规划工具，适用于肩关节不稳患者的临床应用及大规模筛查。

Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

### [44] [Error-Driven Scene Editing for 3D Grounding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14086)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D场景编辑的错误驱动框架DEER-3D，通过精细的空间操作生成反事实样本，以解决3D-LLM在语言与视觉空间元素对齐上的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D-LLM因训练数据偏重语言推理而缺乏空间理解，且3D资源稀缺导致固有的 grounding 偏差难以消除。

Method: 提出DEER-3D框架，采用“分解、诊断评估、编辑、再训练”流程：先定位模型的谓词级错误（如属性或空间关系），然后进行最小化、与谓词对齐的3D场景编辑（如改色或移动物体），生成针对性的反事实监督信号用于迭代微调。

Result: 在多个3D grounding 和场景理解基准上验证了该方法的有效性，通过迭代优化显著提升了模型的 grounding 准确率。

Conclusion: DEER-3D证明了基于错误驱动的精细化场景编辑能有效弥合3D语言模型在语言推理与空间感知之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的医学图像分割网络GCA-ResUNet，通过在ResNet-50残差块中引入分组坐标注意力（GCA），有效增强了全局依赖建模能力，在保持计算效率的同时提升了分割精度。


<details>

Conclusion: GCA为卷积网络提供了一种轻量级且有效的全局建模方式，实现了高精度与资源效率兼顾的医学图像分割，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 由于视角和尺度差异大以及背景干扰复杂，传统的多阶段检索-匹配流程容易产生累积误差，因此需要一种更精确、端到端的地理定位方法。

Method: 提出SMGeo，采用Swin-Transformer进行双模态特征联合编码，引入网格级稀疏混合专家（GMoE）增强跨视图依赖建模，并使用无锚框检测头通过热图监督直接回归坐标，支持点击提示实现交互式定位。

Conclusion: SMGeo通过端到端架构和稀疏专家机制有效提升了跨视角物体地理定位的精度与交互能力，为该任务提供了一种高效且先进的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view object Geo-localization aims to precisely pinpoint the same object across large-scale satellite imagery based on drone images. Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage "retrieval-matching" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively). Ablation studies demonstrate complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二元交叉熵（BCE）的三重协同学习方法BCE3S，用于长尾识别，通过解耦特征与分类器向量度量、增强类内紧凑性和类间可分性，并平衡分类器向量间的可分性，在多个长尾数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Motivation: 现有基于交叉熵（CE）损失的方法在长尾识别中难以实现理想的特征紧凑性和可分性，且Softmax中的分类器向量不平衡问题加剧了性能下降。

Method: 提出BCE3S，包含三个部分：基于BCE的联合学习（解耦特征与分类器度量）、对比学习（提升类内紧凑性）和均匀学习（平衡分类器向量间的可分性），三者协同优化特征与分类器。

Conclusion: BCE3S通过解耦和协同学习机制有效解决了长尾识别中特征学习与分类器不平衡的问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

Motivation: 现有全合一图像恢复方法依赖任务特定设计或隐式路由策略，难以应对复杂真实场景中多种退化的混合情况，缺乏可解释性和灵活性。

Method: 采用冻结的多模态大语言模型作为规划器，生成频域感知的恢复计划；执行器基于扩散模型，集成LoRA-MoE模块，根据计划动态选择高频或低频专家，并引入频率特征、对抗训练和频率正则化损失以提升恢复质量。

Result: 在七个图像恢复任务上实现最先进性能，尤其在混合退化条件下展现出强零样本泛化能力，有效减少伪影并提升恢复细节。

Conclusion: FAPE-IR通过语义规划与频域恢复的耦合，提供了一种统一、可解释且灵活的全合一图像恢复解决方案，显著提升了多退化场景下的恢复效果与适应性。

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了“推理视频编辑”任务，即通过多跳推理理解隐式文本指令进行视频编辑，并提出了RIVER模型，该模型利用数字孪生表示和大语言模型进行推理，指导扩散模型完成像素级修改，在新提出的RVEBenchmark及现有基准上均表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法需要明确的时空定位信息，难以处理用户基于语义或对象关系的隐式文本指令，因此需要能够理解并推理隐式查询的编辑方法。

Method: RIVER将推理与生成解耦：首先构建保留时空结构和语义属性的视频数字孪生表示；大语言模型结合隐式查询进行多跳推理，输出结构化编辑指令；扩散模型根据指令执行像素级修改；训练采用强化学习，结合推理准确性和生成质量的奖励。

Result: 提出了RVEBenchmark，包含100个视频和519个隐式查询，涵盖三种推理复杂度；RIVER在RVEBenchmark上性能最优，并在VegGIE和FiVE两个基准上超越六个基线方法，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: RIVER首次实现了对隐式文本指令的多跳推理视频编辑，通过解耦推理与生成框架有效提升了对复杂语义指令的理解与执行能力，推动了文本驱动视频编辑向更自然的人机交互方式发展。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono在显著降低模型复杂度的同时保持优异性能，有效平衡了效率与精度，适合实际部署于自动驾驶和机器人导航等应用场景。

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

Method: 提出非对称聚合方法，采用行列归一化与独立边缘校准，并引入可学习坐标嵌入的几何约束，融合空间相近特征的相似性得分。

Result: 在MSLS、NordLand和Pittsburgh数据集上取得优于现有方法的表现。

Conclusion: $A^2$GC-VPR通过非对称匹配和几何感知的特征聚合，有效提升了视觉位置识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在微调过程中控制模型不学习数据中不希望出现的概念，并避免这些概念与用户提示相混淆，对于偏见缓解、防止恶意适应等下游任务至关重要。

Method: 通过保持用户提示的嵌入不与不希望的概念对齐来实现控制；使用语言描述指定不希望的概念，无需额外训练即可灵活修改。

Result: 实验表明，Coffee能有效阻止文本到图像模型在微调期间学习指定的不希望概念，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Coffee提供了一种无需额外训练、灵活且可控的方法，用于防止扩散模型在微调中学习和纠缠不希望的概念。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MP-PVIR通过整合多视角视频、行为相位建模与语言生成，实现了从事故检测到可操作洞察的跃迁，推动了车路协同系统中AI驱动交通安全分析的发展。

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

### [55] [Attention Via Convolutional Nearest Neighbors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14137)
*Mingi Kang,Jeová Farias Sales Rocha Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一卷积和自注意力机制的框架ConvNN，通过k近邻聚合揭示二者在邻域选择与聚合上的共性，并在CIFAR分类任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络与Transformer被视为截然不同的架构，但卷积和自注意力本质上都是邻域信息聚合操作，作者旨在建立统一框架以弥合两者之间的鸿沟。

Method: 提出Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN) 框架，将卷积（基于空间邻近）和注意力（基于特征相似性）统一为k近邻聚合的不同特例，并作为即插即用模块应用于VGG和ViT等架构。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，ConvNN在VGG中提升准确率，在ViT中优于标准注意力及其他变体；消融实验表明k值选择和结构设计对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 卷积与自注意力存在于同一连续谱系，ConvNN提供了统一视角，有助于设计更合理、可解释的视觉模型。

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型的视频时刻检索框架SMART，结合音频线索和镜头级时间结构，通过镜头感知的令牌压缩保留细粒度时序信息，在多个基准上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频时刻检索方法多依赖粗粒度时序理解和单一视觉模态，难以处理复杂视频内容，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SMART框架，融合音频与视觉特征，引入镜头感知的令牌压缩机制，选择性保留每个镜头中的高信息量令牌，并优化提示设计以更好利用音视频线索。

Result: 在Charades-STA和QVHighlights数据集上取得显著性能提升，其中Charades-STA上的R1@0.5提升1.61%，R1@0.7提升2.59%。

Conclusion: SMART通过整合音频模态和镜头级时间结构，有效提升了视频时刻检索的精度，尤其在细粒度时序定位方面表现优越。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出iGaussian，一种基于3D高斯场景表示的两阶段前馈框架，通过直接反演3D高斯实现单图像实时相机位姿估计，避免了传统渲染-比较-优化循环的计算开销，在多个数据集上显著提升了精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF或高斯点阵渲染的位姿估计方法依赖多轮迭代优化，计算开销大，难以满足机器人实时性需求。

Method: 提出iGaussian，包含两个阶段：第一阶段利用基于高斯场景先验的位姿回归网络（结合空间均匀采样与引导注意力机制）回归粗略6DoF位姿；第二阶段通过特征匹配与多模型融合进行精炼。核心创新包括无需可微渲染的跨相关模块，以及融合多个策略采样视图特征的加权多视图预测器。

Result: 在NeRF Synthetic、Mip-NeRF 360和T&T+DB数据集上实验表明，该方法将中值旋转误差降低至0.2°，在移动机器人上实现2.87 FPS的跟踪速度，相比基于优化的方法有10倍加速。

Conclusion: iGaussian通过直接反演3D高斯实现实时、高精度的相机位姿估计，有效克服了传统渲染-优化循环的效率瓶颈，为SLAM和视觉导航中的实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毫米波重建方法受限于覆盖范围小和噪声高，难以准确重建被遮挡物体的完整3D几何。

Method: 设计了一个三阶段管道：生成候选几何表面、使用专为毫米波信号设计的Transformer模型进行形状补全、基于熵的表面选择；结合物理特性并利用合成点云训练。

Result: 在与最先进基线方法的对比中，召回率从54%提升至72%，同时保持85%的高精度。

Conclusion: Wave-Former通过融合物理感知与Transformer模型，实现了对多样化遮挡物体的高效3D重建，并在真实数据上展现出良好泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在理解抽象的手绘草图方面能力有限，主要原因是缺乏同时包含草图、真实图像和自然语言指令的大规模联合建模数据集。

Method: 构建了一个新的大规模图像-草图-指令三元组数据集，用于预训练和指令微调，并在此基础上训练了新的LVLM模型O3SLM。

Result: 在多个基于草图的任务（如目标定位、计数、图像检索和视觉问答）上的实验表明，O3SLM显著优于现有LVLM，在草图理解和推理方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过引入大规模多模态数据集和针对性训练，可显著提升LVLM对抽象草图的理解能力，推动其在更广泛实际场景中的应用。

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在未见域中性能下降严重，主要由于忽略了表征和模态协同的不变性风险。

Method: 提出了AsyIRM学习径向空间中的不变球形决策边界，以及MMSD通过跨样本混合和解耦增强模态特征。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证了RiSe的有效性，在跨域任务上达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: RiSe能有效缓解多模态FAS中的跨域性能退化问题，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MVI-Bench，首个专门评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在误导性视觉输入下鲁棒性的综合基准，基于视觉基本要素设计了三个层次的误导类型，并引入新指标MVI-Sensitivity进行细粒度评估，实验揭示了现有LVLMs的显著脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs鲁棒性评测多关注文本误导或幻觉，忽视了误导性视觉输入对视觉理解能力的影响，亟需一个系统性基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出MVI-Bench基准，基于视觉概念、属性和关系三个层次构建六类误导视觉输入，收集1,248个专家标注的VQA实例，并设计MVI-Sensitivity指标实现细粒度鲁棒性评估。

Result: 在18个最先进的LVLM上测试发现模型普遍对误导性视觉输入敏感，表现出显著脆弱性，且不同模型在各层级误导类型上的表现差异明显。

Conclusion: MVI-Bench有效揭示了当前LVLMs在处理误导性视觉输入时的不足，为提升其鲁棒性和可靠性提供了可操作的改进方向。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于对象级token合并的自适应压缩策略，显著减少多模态大模型中的图像token数量，同时保持接近原始模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于patch的token化方法导致token数量呈二次增长，计算和内存开销大，且与人类视觉认知系统不一致，易引发幻觉和冗余计算。

Method: 提出一种对象级token合并策略，实现自适应token压缩，使其更符合人类视觉认知机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试上实验表明，该方法平均仅使用10%的token即达到原始模型约96%的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法在保持高性能的同时大幅压缩token数量，有效平衡了计算效率与模型表现，更具类人视觉认知一致性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

Motivation: 现有自监督对比学习方法对骨架区域进行均匀处理，并采用FIFO队列存储负样本，导致运动信息丢失和负样本选择不优。

Method: 提出DoGCLR框架，将正负样本构建建模为动态优势博弈；设计时空双权重定位机制以增强运动多样性并保持语义；采用熵驱动的优势策略管理记忆库，保留高熵难负样本。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和PKU-MMD数据集上实验表明，DoGCLR在多个设置下超越现有方法，最高提升达2.7%，并在PKU-MMD Part II上提升1.9%。

Conclusion: DoGCLR有效解决了骨架动作识别中运动信息丢失和负样本选择问题，具有更强的判别能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为UniSER的通用模型，用于统一处理由镜头光晕、雾霾、阴影和反射等软效应引起的图像退化问题。通过构建一个包含380万对数据的大规模数据集，并采用定制化的训练流程微调Diffusion Transformer，该模型实现了对多种软退化类型的高保真实时修复，显著优于专用和通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像恢复方法通常针对特定退化问题设计专用模型，缺乏泛化能力；而现有通用模型在细粒度任务上表现不佳，难以稳健地去除软效应并保持场景身份。因此需要一个能统一处理各类软效应的通用框架。

Method: 基于软效应的共同本质（半透明遮挡），构建了一个大规模、物理合理的3.8M配对数据集，填补公开基准的空白；采用Diffusion Transformer架构，结合精细的掩码与强度控制进行微调，实现对多样化软退化的联合建模与恢复。

Result: UniSER在多个软效应恢复任务上显著优于现有专用和通用模型，展现出强大的泛化性与鲁棒性，能够在真实复杂场景中实现高质量、高保真的图像恢复。

Conclusion: UniSER为图像软退化恢复提供了一个统一、高效的解决方案，验证了构建通用图像恢复模型的可行性，推动了从专用模型向基础性、多功能模型的转变。

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

Motivation: 现有图像分词方法受限于局部监督，语义分布不够均匀，影响生成性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上实现了最先进的图像重建和生成性能。

Conclusion: GloTok通过全局语义建模显著提升了图像生成质量，且无需训练时访问预训练模型。

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

Motivation: 现有自动驾驶数据集多基于人工驾驶或未明确驾驶模式采集，难以真实反映自动驾驶系统在实际运行中的行为安全性，因此需要一个全自动驾驶模式下采集的数据集来评估AV的真实行为安全。

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

Abstract: Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了类别不平衡和层次结构建模问题，显著提升了主动脉多分支血管分割的准确性与效率，具备良好的临床实用性。

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24.

Conclusion: DetGain是一种通用且互补的在线数据策展策略，能有效提升目标检测的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有船舶重识别方法多借鉴行人重识别算法，难以应对船舶图像中较大的类内差异和严重的局部缺失问题，导致同一身份出现异常样本。

Method: 提出MCFormer，包含全局相关模块（GCM）和局部相关模块（LCM）。GCM通过构建跨所有图像的全局相似性关联矩阵，基于图像间一致性进行特征聚合；LCM利用动态记忆库挖掘并对其具有上下文相似性的局部特征，补偿局部缺失。同时融合多尺度的全局与局部相关特征以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个船舶重识别基准上的实验表明，MCFormer取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCFormer通过显式建模多尺度图像间相关性，有效缓解了类内变异和局部缺失带来的影响，显著提升了船舶重识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Weimin Bai,Suzhe Xu,Yiwei Ren,Jinhua Hao,Ming Sun,Wenzheng Chen,He Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了InstantViR，一种基于预训练视频扩散先验的快速视频重建框架，通过将双向视频扩散模型蒸馏到因果自回归模型中，实现单次前向传播完成高质量、低延迟的视频恢复，无需迭代优化，并在保持高感知质量的同时达到实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的视频恢复方法存在时间伪影或推理速度过慢的问题，难以满足流媒体、远程呈现和AR/VR等应用对高感知质量和低延迟的需求。因此，需要一种既能继承强大时间建模能力又能实现实时处理的视频逆问题解决方案。

Method: 提出InstantViR，采用蒸馏策略将强大的双向视频扩散模型（教师）知识迁移到一个因果自回归网络（学生），直接从退化视频生成恢复结果；使用先验驱动的蒸馏方式，无需配对的真实数据；并通过引入LeanVAE替代原VAE，在潜在空间实现高效低延迟处理。

Result: 在流媒体随机修复、高斯去模糊和超分辨率任务上，InstantViR达到或超过了现有扩散模型基线的质量，同时在NVIDIA A100 GPU上运行速度超过35 FPS，相比迭代式视频扩散方法加速高达100倍。

Conclusion: InstantViR证明了基于扩散先验的视频恢复可以兼顾高质量与极低延迟，使其适用于实时交互式流媒体系统，推动高质视频恢复技术在现代视觉系统中的实际部署。

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

Conclusion: MCS有效解决了盲脸修复中一对多映射的建模难题，实现了高质量、可控且多样化的面部恢复。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

Conclusion: APS是一种模型无关的框架，能有效增强运动预测中的主动感知能力，显著提升预测精度和泛化性。

Abstract: Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.

Conclusion: WeSTAR能有效增强单目深度估计基础模型的适应性与鲁棒性，兼顾训练稳定性与知识保留。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: GSLR框架通过可学习的高斯点阵有效提升了多维图像的表示能力，为张量分解提供了新的高效途径。

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) endeavors to transfer generalized knowledge from the source domain to target domains using only a minimal amount of training data, which faces a triplet of learning challenges in the meantime, i.e., semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督、基于表面的骨表面配准框架NeuralBoneReg，用于计算机辅助骨科手术中的跨模态数据对齐，具有良好的泛化性和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机辅助骨科手术中，不同成像模态间的异质性导致术前与术中数据配准困难且易出错，需要一种鲁棒、自动且模态无关的骨表面配准方法。

Method: NeuralBoneReg采用3D点云作为模态无关表示，包含两个模块：隐式神经无符号距离场（UDF）学习术前骨模型，以及基于MLP的配准模块进行全局初始化和局部优化，通过生成变换假设将术中点云与神经UDF对齐；该方法为自监督，无需跨被试训练数据。

Result: 在多个多模态数据集（包括新提出的UltraBones-Hip）上，NeuralBoneReg表现优于或媲美现有方法，平均旋转误差（RRE）和平移误差（RTE）分别为1.68°/1.86 mm（UltraBones100k）、1.88°/1.89 mm（UltraBones-Hip）和3.79°/2.45 mm（SpineDepth），显示出跨解剖结构和模态的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: NeuralBoneReg是一种无需监督训练、适用于多种成像模态和骨骼部位的高效骨表面配准方法，可为计算机辅助骨科手术提供鲁棒准确的跨模态对齐方案。

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Conclusion: SAM-Fed有效解决了联邦半监督学习中模型容量与设备资源之间的矛盾，通过引入强大教师模型引导轻量客户端，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了高质量、稳定的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

Conclusion: Diff-NAF能有效提升超稀疏视角下的CT重建质量，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.

Abstract: Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

Conclusion: DentalSCR能稳健处理真实临床头影片，提供高保真、可临床检验的3D-2D配准效果，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

Abstract: Blinking is a vital physiological process that protects and maintains the health of the ocular surface. Objective assessment of eyelid movements remains challenging due to the complexity, cost, and limited clinical applicability of existing tools. This study presents the clinical validation of Bapp (Blink Application), a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework and integrated with Google ML Kit for on-device, real-time analysis of eyelid movements. The validation occurred using 45 videos from real patients, whose blinks were manually annotated by ophthalmology specialists from the Paulista School of Medicine of the Federal University of Sao Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) to serve as the ground truth. Bapp's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, including Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with results demonstrating 98.4% precision, 96.9% recall, and an overall accuracy of 98.3%. These outcomes confirm the reliability of Bapp as a portable, accessible, and objective tool for monitoring both normal and abnormal eyelid movements. The application offers a promising alternative to traditional manual blink counting, supporting continuous ocular health monitoring and postoperative evaluation in clinical environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的联合特征域去模糊与检测框架JFD3，通过双分支结构和特征级监督提升红外无人机目标在运动模糊下的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去模糊方法多关注视觉质量提升，忽视了对检测任务至关重要的判别性特征增强，导致模糊条件下检测性能受限。

Method: 设计共享权重的双分支架构：1）轻量级特征恢复网络，以清晰分支特征作为监督指导模糊分支；2）频率结构引导模块，将恢复网络的结构先验融入浅层检测网络；3）特征一致性自监督损失，使模糊分支逼近清晰分支的特征表示。

Result: 在新构建的IRBlurUAV数据集（30,000张模拟和4,118张真实模糊图像）上实验表明，JFD3显著提升了检测性能，同时保持实时性。

Conclusion: JFD3通过联合优化去模糊与检测，有效增强了模糊条件下的特征判别性，为红外无人机目标检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

### [95] [A Quantitative Method for Shoulder Presentation Evaluation in Biometric Identity Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14376)
*Alfonso Pedro Ridao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种肩部呈现评估（SPE）算法，用于量化生物识别证件照片中肩部的偏航和翻滚角度，仅使用常见姿态估计框架提供的两个肩部关键点的3D坐标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国际生物识别身份文件标准对肩部姿态有严格要求，但现有自动化质量评估方法缺乏对此类属性的定量评价手段。

Method: 利用两个肩部关键点的3D坐标，通过几何计算量化肩部的yaw和roll角度，生成SPE评分，并与人工标注进行相关性分析。

Result: 在121张人像图像数据集上验证，SPE评分与人工标注具有强皮尔逊相关性（r≈0.80），且通过Error-versus-Discard分析证明其能有效识别不合规样本。

Conclusion: 所提出的SPE算法是一种轻量、有效的自动化工具，可用于注册系统中的合规性检查。

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对自动驾驶中立体匹配模型的新型纹理增强型物理对抗攻击，采用具有全局伪装纹理的3D物理对抗样本，提升了攻击在不同视角下的视觉一致性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击多基于2D图像补丁且主要针对单目感知系统，而对基于立体视觉的深度估计系统的物理对抗样本研究较少，因此需要探索更真实、有效的攻击方式。

Method: 提出一种带有全局伪装纹理的3D物理对抗样本，并设计新的3D立体匹配渲染模块以应对双目相机的视差效应，同时引入细粒度优化的融合攻击策略，使对抗样本无缝融入环境。

Result: 实验表明所提方法能有效误导立体匹配模型，导致其生成错误的深度信息，且具备更高的隐蔽性和攻击性。

Conclusion: 该方法是首个针对立体深度估计的纹理增强型物理对抗攻击，显著提升了物理攻击在自动驾驶感知系统中的隐蔽性与有效性。

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的自动驾驶代理缺乏强制执行交通规则的机制，且难以可靠检测小型但关键的安全物体（如交通灯和标志）。

Method: 设计TLS-Assist框架，将交通灯和标志的检测结果转化为结构化自然语言消息，并注入LLM输入中，以强制关注安全关键信息；支持单视图和多视图相机设置，具有即插即用和模型无关特性。

Result: 在CARLA的LangAuto基准上闭环测试显示，相比LMDrive和BEVDriver分别最高提升14%和7%的驾驶性能，并持续减少交通灯和标志违规。

Conclusion: TLS-Assist有效增强了LLM-based驾驶代理的安全性和可靠性，为自动驾驶系统中的规则遵循和关键目标检测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在同时存在人体和相机运动的情况下，难以准确估计世界坐标系下的人体3D运动，且缺乏包含真实人体与相机运动的高质量标注数据集，限制了相关研究的发展。

Method: 构建并发布BEDLAM2.0数据集，扩展了更真实多样的相机设置、人体形状、动作、服饰、发型、3D环境，并添加鞋子；提供渲染视频、真实身体参数、相机运动及部分3D资产，用于训练和评估3D人体姿态与运动回归模型。

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0是一个更丰富、更真实的数据集，能有效推动基于视频的3D人体运动在世界坐标下的估计研究，有望成为未来该领域的重要训练资源。

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

Motivation: 现有领域增量学习方法在统一视觉空间时导致域间干扰和语义失真，而分离参数则造成知识碎片化，难以实现知识复用与防遗忘。

Method: 提出LAVA框架，使用文本锚点引导视觉表征的相对对齐，保持跨域的一致性几何结构，通过类名间的语义相似性定义相对关系，实现类感知先验知识的检索与鲁棒特征聚合。

Result: 在多个标准DIL基准上实验表明，LAVA显著优于当前最先进方法，有效缓解了知识遗忘并提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: LAVA通过语言锚定的视觉对齐机制，成功解决了领域增量学习中的知识碎片化与语义扭曲问题，为跨域知识保留与复用提供了新思路。

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

Conclusion: Cranio-ID框架在法医和生物医学应用中展现出高效、准确的跨模态颅面匹配能力，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

TL;DR: 该研究通过模拟婴儿视觉发育过程中的低清晰度、去色到彩色和时间连续性特点，提出了一种名为CATDiet的自监督学习训练方法，并在此基础上发展出CombDiet，显著提升了模型在物体识别和深度感知上的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索婴儿视觉发育过程中阶段性‘视觉饮食’的生态优势，为构建更鲁棒的机器视觉系统提供生物学启发的训练框架。

Method: 在自监督学习模型中引入模拟婴儿视觉的约束条件（灰度到彩色C，模糊到清晰A，时间连续性T），即CATDiet，并进一步设计CombDiet，在标准训练前以CATDiet初始化并保持时间连续性。使用以物体为中心或婴幼儿头戴摄像头拍摄的视频进行训练。

Result: 所有CATDiet变体在十项测试中均表现出更强的物体识别鲁棒性，并展现出与生物发育对齐的模式，如猕猴V1区突触密度变化和婴儿视觉悬崖行为的类比表现。CombDiet在领域内和跨领域的物体识别与深度感知任务上优于标准自监督方法。

Conclusion: 婴儿视觉发育的阶段性特征为机器视觉智能的鲁棒性发展提供了有效的反向工程框架，启示了未来AI训练应借鉴人类感知发展的路径。

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视频理解中缺乏对证据的反复访问和迭代优化，而基于代理的方法通常依赖昂贵的专有模型或强化学习训练。

Method: 设计了Retrieve-Perceive-Review三阶段推理流程，构建基于实体图的结构化视频知识库，并集成开源模型组合（推理大模型+轻量CV模型+视觉语言模型）。

Result: 在LVBench、VideoMME-Long、LongVideoBench和Charades-STA等多个长视频理解基准上取得了具有竞争力的结果，同时具备良好的可解释性。

Conclusion: AVI提供了一种灵活、无需训练且可解释的视频理解框架，有效模拟人类理解过程，减少对专有模型和强化学习训练的依赖。

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.

Motivation: 传统的单次查询图像检索方法难以准确捕捉用户意图，缺乏交互性和容错能力，因此需要一种能够通过多轮对话动态优化检索过程的方法。

Method: 提出DIR-TIR框架，包含对话精炼模块（Dialog Refiner Module）和图像精炼模块（Image Refiner Module）。前者通过主动提问获取关键信息并生成更精确的文本描述，后者识别生成图像与用户意图之间的感知差异，缩小视觉语义差距。

Result: 在多个图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于仅依赖初始描述的基线方法，在检索精度和交互体验方面均有提升。

Conclusion: DIR-TIR通过双模块协同机制，利用多轮对话实现了更高可控性和容错性的图像检索，为交互式文本到图像检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of interactive, conversational text-to-image retrieval.
  Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module.
  The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image.
  Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy.
  Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.

Motivation: 现有融合方法多采用分阶段策略，难以有效应对低光照与运动模糊共同导致的退化问题，限制了低光视频去模糊的效果。

Method: 提出CompEvent框架，包含复数时序对齐GRU和复数空频学习模块，利用复数卷积在时空域和频域统一处理，实现事件流与视频流的连续融合与深度特征互补。

Result: 实验表明CompEvent在多个指标上优于当前最先进方法，显著提升了低光视频去模糊的质量。

Conclusion: CompEvent通过复数神经网络实现了事件相机与RGB视频的高效全过程融合，为低光视频去模糊提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light video deblurring poses significant challenges in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving due to dim lighting and long exposures. While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task. The code is available at https://github.com/YuXie1/CompEvent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的冰下地形对冰盖建模至关重要，但雷达观测稀疏且分布不均，需提高外推能力和物理一致性。

Method: 采用DeepLabV3+解码器与标准编码器（如ResNet-50），结合多尺度质量守恒、流向总变差、拉普拉斯阻尼、厚度非负性、渐进式先验一致性及置信图调制的掩码Huber损失进行训练。

Conclusion: 残差叠加先验的设计结合物理约束，生成空间连贯且物理合理的冰床地形，适用于存在域偏移的实际制图任务。

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN.

Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SEED-SR的新方法，通过在分割感知的潜在空间中进行超分辨率（SR），而非传统的像素空间，实现了20倍尺度因子下的农场边界分割，显著优于现有参考型超分辨率方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小农户农田边界的精确提取依赖高分辨率卫星图像，但其重访周期长；低分辨率图像虽更新频繁，但细节不足。现有参考型超分辨率方法在感知质量与关键特征保留之间存在矛盾，且难以满足大尺度放大需求，同时两步法（先超分后分割）无法有效融合多源卫星数据。

Method: 提出SEED-SR，结合条件潜在扩散模型与大规模多光谱、多源地理空间基础模型，在分割感知的潜在空间中直接进行超分辨率，绕过传统像素空间的显式超分过程，并充分利用高分辨率参考图像和低分辨率时序图像。

Result: 在两个真实大规模数据集上实验表明，相比当前最先进的参考型超分辨率方法，SEED-SR在实例分割和语义分割指标上分别实现了最高25.5%和12.9%的相对提升，支持20倍超分辨率下的精确分割。

Conclusion: SEED-SR通过将超分辨率任务从像素空间转移到分割感知的潜在空间，有效解决了小农户农田边界提取中高分辨率与高时间频率之间的矛盾，为农业遥感监测提供了一种更高效、准确的多源数据融合方案。

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖卷积层和注意力机制来探索任务级交互，但在建模全局任务关系和参数扩展性方面存在局限。

Method: 设计了参数感知Mamba模型（PAMM），利用状态空间模型的大规模可扩展参数，引入双状态空间参数专家以设置任务特定参数先验，并结合多方向希尔伯特扫描构建多角度特征序列。

Conclusion: PAMM通过状态空间模型实现了更高效的任务间建模与全局先验融合，为多任务密集预测提供了一个可扩展且强大的新范式。

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于人类视觉系统（HVS）原理的新型LDCT图像增强模型D-PerceptCT，结合语义感知与多尺度特征提取，并设计了深部感知相关性损失函数（DPRLF），在保留关键解剖和病理细节方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT图像因辐射剂量降低导致噪声增加和质量下降，现有方法常过度平滑，丢失重要细节，因此需要一种能保留感知关键特征的增强方法。

Method: 提出D-PerceptCT模型，包含两个主要模块：1）视觉双路径提取器（ViDex），融合DINOv2的语义先验与局部空间特征；2）全局-局部状态空间模块，捕获长距离与多尺度信息；并设计基于人眼对比敏感度的深部感知相关性损失函数（DPRLF）。

Result: 在Mayo2016数据集上的实验表明，D-PerceptCT在结构和纹理信息的保留上优于当前最先进的方法，显著提升LDCT图像的视觉质量和诊断可用性。

Conclusion: D-PerceptCT通过引入人类视觉系统启发的架构与损失函数，有效提升了低剂量CT图像的质量，在减少噪声的同时更好保留了对临床诊断至关重要的细节。

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DeCo-VAE的视频变分自编码器，通过将视频内容分解为关键帧、运动和残差三个组件进行显式解耦，分别学习各部分的潜在表示，从而实现紧凑且高效的视频重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频VAE忽略了帧间内容的相似性，导致潜在空间建模冗余。因此需要一种更高效的方法来减少冗余并提升重建质量。

Method: 将视频内容显式解耦为关键帧、运动和残差三个部分，使用专用编码器分别处理，并采用共享3D解码器重构视频；训练时采用解耦适应策略，冻结部分编码器并依次训练其他部分。

Result: 在多个定量和定性实验中，DeCo-VAE展现出优于现有方法的视频重建性能，有效分离静态与动态特征，提升重建精度和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: DeCo-VAE通过显式解耦和专用编码器设计，实现了更紧凑的潜在表示和更优的视频重建效果，验证了解耦建模在视频VAE中的有效性。

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: 该研究为水下图像恢复提供了可靠、可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，并公开了合成数据集以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement. The generated dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/yftian2025/SynUIEDatasets.git.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ForensicFlow的三模态深度伪造视频检测框架，通过融合RGB、纹理和频率信息，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单流CNN方法难以捕捉跨空间、纹理和频率域的多尺度伪造痕迹，导致检测鲁棒性和泛化能力不足。

Method: 设计了三分支结构：RGB分支（ConvNeXt-tiny）提取全局视觉不一致性；纹理分支（Swin Transformer-tiny）检测细粒度融合伪影；频率分支（CNN+SE）识别周期性频谱噪声；通过注意力机制进行时序池化和自适应特征融合。

Result: 在Celeb-DF (v2)数据集上使用Focal Loss训练，达到AUC 0.9752、F1-Score 0.9408和准确率0.9208，优于单流基线模型；消融实验验证了各分支协同作用，Grad-CAM可视化表明模型关注法证关键区域。

Conclusion: ForensicFlow通过多模态特征融合有效提升了对细微伪造痕迹的检测能力，具有更强的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

Conclusion: 所提方法能够有效提升多SDF表示的保真度与紧凑性，为复杂3D场景的隐式建模提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了无物体先验下手-物交互建模中的关键难题，在复杂动态场景中实现了高质量的几何与外观重建。

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

Motivation: 准确检测和区分同时发生的重叠活动（如人类入侵、动物移动和车辆震动）在边境监控中具有挑战性，因为地震信号复杂且噪声多，传统方法易导致误分类和漏检。

Conclusion: HyMAD为基于地震传感的多活动识别提供了一个有效的解决方案，具有模块化设计优势，适用于实际安全监控应用。

Abstract: Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.

Abstract: We present a clustering-based explainability technique for digital pathology models based on convolutional neural networks. Unlike commonly used methods based on saliency maps, such as occlusion, GradCAM, or relevance propagation, which highlight regions that contribute the most to the prediction for a single slide, our method shows the global behaviour of the model under consideration, while also providing more fine-grained information. The result clusters can be visualised not only to understand the model, but also to increase confidence in its operation, leading to faster adoption in clinical practice. We also evaluate the performance of our technique on an existing model for detecting prostate cancer, demonstrating its usefulness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC任务本质上是视觉推理问题，但现有研究多将其视为语言问题，使用大语言模型或循环推理模型处理；作者希望从视觉角度出发，引入视觉先验知识，探索更符合任务本质的视觉驱动方法。

Method: 将ARC任务建模为图像到图像翻译问题，将输入输出表示在可处理的‘画布’上，使用标准视觉架构（如ViT）进行端到端训练，模型仅在ARC数据上从零开始训练，并通过测试时训练实现对未见任务的泛化。

Conclusion: 通过将ARC置于视觉范式下，使用简单但合适的视觉模型可以取得优异表现，证明了视觉先验和图像表示在抽象推理任务中的有效性，为未来研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a "canvas" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance.

Result: 相比现有方法，OmniZip实现了3.42倍的推理加速和1.4倍的内存减少，且无需训练。

Conclusion: OmniZip有效解决了OmniLLM中的音视频联合压缩问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于表格数据和基于MRI图像的表示在预测阿尔茨海默病认知衰退中的作用，提出了一种基于动态时间规整聚类的轨迹感知标签策略，并利用无监督预训练3D Vision Transformer提取解剖结构保持的MRI嵌入。结果表明，临床和体积特征在预测轻度和重度进展方面表现较好（AUC约0.70），而ViT提取的MRI嵌入在识别认知稳定个体方面更优（AUC 0.71），但所有方法在中等进展组上均表现不佳，提示应采用多模态融合策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模阿尔茨海默病的认知衰退对于早期分层和个性化管理至关重要。传统表格特征虽能有效反映整体风险，但难以捕捉细微脑部变化，因此需要结合更敏感的影像表征以提升预测性能。

Method: 提出一种基于动态时间规整（DTW）聚类的轨迹感知标签策略，用于捕捉异质性的认知变化模式；在标准化和增强的MRI数据上，通过无监督重建预训练3D Vision Transformer（ViT）以获得解剖结构保持的MRI嵌入；随后将预训练编码器嵌入用于传统机器学习分类器和深度学习头，并与表格特征及卷积网络基线进行比较。

Result: 临床和体积特征在预测轻度和严重认知进展时AUC达到约0.70，表现最佳；ViT提取的MRI嵌入在区分认知稳定个体时AUC为0.71，表现最优；但在中等程度进展组中所有方法均表现较差。

Conclusion: 临床特征更擅长识别高风险极端人群，而基于Transformer的MRI嵌入对认知稳定的细微标志更敏感，两者具有互补性，建议未来采用多模态融合策略来建模阿尔茨海默病的疾病进展。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出HoloTea，一种3D感知的流程匹配框架，能从H&E图像中推断出spot-level基因表达，并利用相邻切片的形态学信息提升空间转录组数据的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从组织学预测空间转录组（ST）的方法大多忽略3D结构，且现有3D方法不具备生成性或扩展性差，难以实现高精度、可扩展的3D组织建模。

Method: 提出HoloTea，基于flow-matching框架，通过在共享特征空间中检索相邻切片的形态对应spot，结合ControlNet融合跨切片上下文；引入结合学习的零膨胀负二项分布（ZINB）先验与空间经验先验的3D一致性先验，更好地建模计数数据；采用全局注意力机制实现3D H&E建模，计算复杂度随spot数量线性增长。

Conclusion: HoloTea能够有效构建高精度3D虚拟组织，有望推动生物标志物发现并加深对疾病机制的理解。

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合姿态和生物力学信息的双流图卷积网络BioST-GCN，用于视觉跌倒预测，在模拟数据上表现良好，但零样本泛化能力差，揭示了仿真与现实之间的显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实老年人跌倒数据稀缺，现有视觉跌倒预测系统依赖模拟数据，但存在仿真与现实之间的性能落差，尤其在糖尿病或虚弱老人中更明显，亟需提升模型在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出BioST-GCN，一种双流时空图卷积网络，融合姿态与生物力学信息，采用交叉注意力机制进行特征融合，并利用时空注意力增强模型可解释性。

Result: 在MCF-UA和MUVIM模拟数据集上，F1分数分别比基线ST-GCN高5.32%和2.91%；在全监督下模拟数据达到89.0% F1，但对未见个体的零样本泛化仅为35.9%。

Conclusion: 仿真数据存在偏差（如‘故意跌倒’线索），导致模型难以泛化到真实老年群体，需通过个性化策略和隐私保护数据管道来缩小仿真-现实鸿沟。

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

Motivation: 在输入视角稀疏的情况下，现有的高斯点阵优化方法容易过拟合，导致重建质量下降，尤其是在使用扁平化高斯基元时，各向异性加剧了这一问题。因此需要一种能同时提升几何重建和新视角渲染质量的方法。

Method: 提出了Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment（立体几何-纹理对齐）来联合优化渲染质量和几何估计，并设计了Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency（伪特征增强几何一致性），利用训练视图和未见视图来增强多视角几何一致性，缓解稀疏监督下的过拟合。

Result: 在DTU、BlendedMVS和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在表面重建精度和新视角合成质量方面均达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效平衡了几何重建与渲染质量，在稀疏视角条件下显著优于现有方法，推动了基于高斯点阵的三维重建技术的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 计算细胞学中实例级标签不可靠且获取成本高，同时见证率极低，传统方法难以有效训练模型。

Method: 提出SLAM-AGS框架，结合滑动负样本上的弱监督相似性目标和正样本上的自监督对比目标进行多任务预训练，并采用自适应梯度手术（Adaptive Gradient Surgery）解决任务间梯度冲突；预训练编码器与基于注意力的多实例学习聚合器结合，实现包级预测与异常实例检索。

Result: 在模拟见证率从10%降至0.5%的骨髓细胞数据集上，SLAM-AGS在包级F1分数和前400个阳性细胞检索方面优于其他预训练方法，尤其在低见证率下提升显著。

Conclusion: 解决梯度干扰可实现稳定的多任务预训练，SLAM-AGS在极低见证率下仍能有效提升下游任务性能，具有良好的应用潜力。

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks. To facilitate reproducibility, we share our complete implementation and evaluation framework as open source: https://github.com/Ace95/SLAM-AGS.

Motivation: 准确的气道分割对肺部定量分析至关重要，但手动标注不现实，现有自动化U-Net方法常产生不连通结构，影响生物标志物提取。

Method: RepAir包含三个阶段：首先使用nnU-Net生成初始气道掩码；然后基于骨架算法检测并提出可能的断裂连接；最后用1D卷积分类器判断候选连接是否为真实解剖分支。

Result: 在ATM'22和AeroPath两个数据集上，RepAir在体素级和拓扑指标上均优于Bronchinet和NaviAirway等现有方法，生成更完整且解剖一致的气道树，同时保持高分割精度。

Conclusion: RepAir通过结合深度学习与解剖学驱动的后处理策略，有效解决了气道分割中的不连通问题，提升了复杂病理情况下的鲁棒性和临床可用性。

Abstract: Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

Motivation: 研究输入图像分辨率变化对自动年龄估计准确性的影响，以提升实际应用中不同分辨率图像的年龄验证性能。

Method: 使用IMDB-Clean数据集中的1000张图像，在七种不同分辨率下生成7000个测试样本，采用Mean Absolute Error (MAE)、Standard Deviation (SD) 和 Median Absolute Error (MedAE) 评估DeepFace和InsightFace的年龄估计性能。

Result: 两种框架在224x224像素时表现最佳（DeepFace MAE为10.83年，InsightFace为7.46年）；低分辨率导致MAE显著上升，过高分辨率也会降低准确性；InsightFace在所有分辨率下均比DeepFace更快。

Conclusion: 输入图像分辨率对年龄估计精度有清晰且一致的影响，选择合适的分辨率（如224x224）可优化性能，且InsightFace在准确性和速度上优于DeepFace。

Abstract: Automatic age estimation is widely used for age verification, where input images often vary considerably in resolution. This study evaluates the effect of image resolution on age estimation accuracy using DeepFace and InsightFace. A total of 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset were processed in seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 test samples. Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions.

Conclusion: 融合生理与解剖先验信息可实现更鲁棒、符合生理规律的心肌瘢痕分割，为医学图像分析提供了‘超越图像’的新方向。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.

Motivation: Transformer中注意力机制的二次复杂度使得超高清视频端到端训练成本过高，因此需要一种高效且无需训练的高分辨率视频生成方法。

Result: 在无需训练的情况下生成超高清视频，细节丰富、全局连贯，效率高，在VBench上优于部分需训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效、高质量的无训练超分辨率视频生成，为大规模视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256条件生成任务上，DSD以42M/118M/205M参数量、50个训练周期即达到FID=13.44/6.38/4.25，无需classifier-free guidance，表现优异。

Conclusion: DSD成功实现了扩散模型的单网络端到端训练，解决了latent collapse问题，为扩散模型与视觉基础模型架构的统一提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Standard Latent Diffusion Models rely on a complex, three-part architecture consisting of a separate encoder, decoder, and diffusion network, which are trained in multiple stages. This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本框架，通过基于扩散视频基础模型的方法，在不进行微调的情况下将合成视频重渲染为逼真的视频，同时保持时空上的多级结构一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升合成视频的现实感，使其在视觉上更接近真实世界视频，同时保留原始合成视频的结构和语义信息。

Method: 利用预训练的扩散视频基础模型，通过辅助模型估计合成视频的结构信息（如深度图、语义图和边缘图），并在生成/去噪过程中引入这些结构信息作为条件，实现无需微调的零样本视频重渲染。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持与原始视频高度结构一致性的同时，达到了最先进的光真实感质量，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法是一种简单、通用且强大的合成视频真实感增强方案，能够在无需精细标注或模型微调的情况下实现高质量的视频重渲染。

Abstract: We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.

Abstract: Engagement recognition in video datasets, unlike traditional image classification tasks, is particularly challenged by subjective labels and noise limiting model performance. To overcome the challenges of subjective and noisy engagement labels, we propose a framework leveraging Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) to refine annotations and guide the training process. Our framework uses a questionnaire to extract behavioral cues and split data into high- and low-reliability subsets. We also introduce a training strategy combining curriculum learning with soft label refinement, gradually incorporating ambiguous samples while adjusting supervision to reflect uncertainty. We demonstrate that classical computer vision models trained on refined high-reliability subsets and enhanced with our curriculum strategy show improvements, highlighting benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs. This method surpasses prior state of the art across engagement benchmarks such as EngageNet (three of six feature settings, maximum improvement of +1.21%), and DREAMS / PAFE with F1 gains of +0.22 / +0.06.

### [137] [Signature vs. Substance: Evaluating the Balance of Adversarial Resistance and Linguistic Quality in Watermarking Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13722)
*William Guo,Adaku Uchendu,Ana Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型（LLM）生成文本的水印技术，发现现有方法在影响文本质量的同时易受对抗攻击（如回译和改写），导致难以广泛应用。实验表明这些技术会偏离原始写作风格且语义保持能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少大语言模型生成文本可能带来的危害，研究者提出使用水印技术嵌入可检测信号以识别AI生成内容。然而当前水印技术存在影响文本质量和易被攻击去除的问题，阻碍了其广泛采用。

Method: 评估多种水印技术对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，比较改写和回译攻击下的表现，并利用语言学指标分析水印文本在质量与写作风格上相对于未水印文本的变化。

Result: 现有水印技术能够保持语义，但会显著偏离原始写作风格，且在对抗攻击下（尤其是回译攻击）容易失效，显示出较低的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 当前的水印技术在保持文本质量和防御对抗攻击方面仍存在严重缺陷，需进一步改进才能促进其在大语言模型中的广泛部署。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential harms of Large Language Models (LLMs)generated text, researchers have proposed watermarking, a process of embedding detectable signals within text. With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\to$ another language $\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.

*Govardhan Padmanabhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种无需训练的方法用于翻译质量评估指导的片段级错误纠正任务，其中基于多LLM候选翻译选择最高质量结果的方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动后编辑（APE）系统存在过度修正问题，导致性能下降，因此探索无需训练且能减少不必要修改的新方法。

Method: 第一种方法是QE指导的重翻译，从多个LLM生成的候选翻译中选择最优结果；第二种方法类似APE，利用LLM根据QE解释替换错误子串，并采用条件启发式策略最小化编辑次数以提高增益-编辑比。

Result: 两种方法的Delta COMET得分分别为0.0201和-0.0108，第一种方法在子任务排行榜上位居第一。

Conclusion: 无需训练的QE指导重翻译方法能有效提升翻译质量并避免过度修正，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The paper presents two approaches submitted to the WMT 2025 Automated Translation Quality Evaluation Systems Task 3 - Quality Estimation (QE)-informed Segment-level Error Correction. While jointly training QE systems with Automatic Post-Editing (APE) has shown improved performance for both tasks, APE systems are still known to overcorrect the output of Machine Translation (MT), leading to a degradation in performance. We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio. The two proposed approaches achieved a Delta COMET score of 0.0201 and -0.0108, respectively, leading the first approach to achieve the winning position on the subtask leaderboard.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了GM-Extract数据集，用于评估大语言模型在多文档任务中检索控制变量的能力，并分析了“中间丢失”现象对实际应用的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型在长上下文中的信息利用能力下降（即“中间丢失”现象），在基于检索的应用中表现受限，因此需要一个真实场景下的基准来系统评估和诊断该问题。

Method: 设计了GM-Extract基准数据集，提出两个评估指标：文档指标（空间检索能力）和变量提取指标（语义检索能力），并在7-8B参数规模的模型上进行系统评估，结合困惑度分析性能模式，并对现有缓解方法进行分类与实证测试。

Result: 实验显示不同上下文表示方式显著影响检索性能；虽未一致观察到U型曲线，但发现了跨模型的清晰性能模式，并与困惑度相关联；黑盒与白盒缓解方法的效果具有高度情境依赖性，部分方法反而导致性能下降。

Conclusion: “中间丢失”现象对实际检索任务有显著影响，现有缓解策略效果复杂且不一致，需结合具体应用场景谨慎选择方法，本研究为理解与改进长上下文检索提供了实用框架与深入洞察。

Abstract: The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过提取结构化解释来解析电商查询中最高级表达的框架，利用LLM挖掘潜在意图，并将语义解释迁移至轻量模型，显著提升搜索与排序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决搜索查询中最高级表达（如“最好”、“最受欢迎”）因涉及多维度比较和语言理解而难以准确解析的问题，同时应对直接使用大模型重排序带来的高延迟挑战。

Method: 将查询分解为属性-值提示（attribute-value hints），在检索的同时并行生成这些结构化提示，并通过知识迁移将LLM的解释能力转移到轻量级模型，以实现高效集成到排序流程中。

Result: 相比基线方法，MAP提升10.9点，MRR提升5.9点，且显著降低推理延迟，实现了高性能与低延迟的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有效捕捉了最高级查询的潜在语义，实现了语言理解与实际部署效率的结合，为检索系统中的语言解释提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Search queries with superlatives (e.g., best, most popular) require comparing candidates across multiple dimensions, demanding linguistic understanding and domain knowledge. We show that LLMs can uncover latent intent behind these expressions in e-commerce queries through a framework that extracts structured interpretations or hints. Our approach decomposes queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into the ranking pipeline. Our method improves search performanc eby 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines. Since direct LLM-based reranking faces prohibitive latency, we develop an efficient approach transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models. Our findings provide insights into how superlative semantics can be represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints.

Result: 在宇宙学和天体化学案例中成功恢复错误推理路径并适应新数据；在10项任务基准上，VLM增强系统的pass@1得分为0.7-0.8，显著优于纯代码（0.2-0.3）和代码+文本基线（0.4-0.5），同时生成可审计的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: VLM作为判断核心的多智能体框架有效支持自主科学发现，具备强纠错能力、高适应性和良好可解释性，推动AI在复杂科研任务中的应用。

Abstract: We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

Motivation: 灾害后的侦察报告包含关键信息，但其非结构化文本难以系统化利用；现有大语言模型在缺乏领域知识支撑时易产生幻觉，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出MoRA-RAG框架，结合混合检索机制、智能分块和验证循环，动态路由查询至特定灾害数据库，并通过证据充分性评估迭代优化检索与推理过程。

Conclusion: MoRA-RAG为将灾后非结构化报告转化为可信、可操作的防灾决策支持提供了新范式。

Abstract: Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，HiEAG在整体准确率上超过了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: HiEAG有效提升了多模态虚假信息检测中外部一致性验证的能力，兼具可解释性与高性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation detection have made remarkable progress in checking the consistencies between different modalities for supporting or refuting image-text pairs. However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.

Motivation: 现有情感数据集（如GoEmotions）存在严重的类别不平衡问题，导致模型对少数类情绪识别效果差，影响多标签情感分类的整体性能。

Method: 构建了一个平衡的多标签情感数据集，融合GoEmotions原始数据、使用RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions标注的Sentiment140样本以及GPT-4 mini生成并人工标注的文本；采用FastText嵌入、CNN、BiLSTM与注意力机制结合的模型结构，使用Sigmoid输出层进行多标签预测，并应用混合精度训练提升效率。

Conclusion: 平衡数据集的构建与融合CNN、RNN及注意力机制的模型架构共同提升了多标签情感分类性能，为解决实际场景中类别不平衡问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-label sentiment classification plays a vital role in natural language processing by detecting multiple emotions within a single text. However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为“隐蔽微调”的新攻击方法，通过分段级干扰和轮转加权损失设计，在仅使用少量样本和计算资源的情况下，有效绕过推理增强视觉-语言模型的安全对齐机制，显著提升攻击成功率，同时保持模型原有的推理能力分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，尽管推理增强视觉-语言模型（RVLMs）依赖安全对齐来防止有害行为，但其暴露的思维链（CoT）痕迹带来了新的攻击面，亟需探索此类模型在细粒度推理路径层面的脆弱性。

Method: 提出“隐蔽微调”攻击方法，通过诱导产生有害的推理轨迹，采用分段级干扰生成恶意思维链，并将模型自生成的输出作为监督微调数据；引入轮转加权损失策略，实现轻量级、分布一致的微调过程。

Result: 实验表明，在仅使用499个样本和单张A100 GPU不到3小时的训练下，该方法在攻击成功率（ASR）上比IDEATOR高出38.52%，同时在AdvBench等多个基准上验证了其有效性，且模型保持原有表示分布和通用推理能力。

Conclusion: 隐蔽微调是一种低成本、高效率的攻击方式，能够成功破坏RVLMs的安全对齐机制，揭示了当前安全对齐方法在面对内部推理路径操纵时的脆弱性，提示未来需加强对模型推理过程的防护。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, yet their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces introduce new attack surfaces. In this work, we find that the safety alignment of RVLMs can be easily break through a novel attack method termed \textbf{Stealth Fine-Tuning}. Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution. Experiments on AdvBench and several general benchmarks demonstrate that Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective way to bypass alignment defenses. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains content that may be disturbing or offensive.}}

Method: 构建基于真实共现模式、ICD描述、同义词、分类体系和相似临床记录的结构化提示，生成覆盖7902个ICD代码的9万个合成多标签出院摘要，并将这些数据用于增强训练集，微调PLM-ICD和GKI-ICD等先进模型。

Result: 该方法在MIMIC-III等数据集上显著扩展了训练分布，略微提升了宏观F1分数，同时保持了较高的微平均F1分数，优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的合成数据能够有效改善长尾ICD编码预测中的公平性，为数据不平衡问题提供了一种可行的数据中心化解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.

TL;DR: 提出HyperABSA，一种基于动态超图的方面情感分析框架，通过样本特定的层次聚类建模方面-观点结构，在多个基准上优于现有图方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的方法仅建模成对依赖关系，需构建多个图以捕捉不同关系视图，导致冗余、参数开销和融合错误传播，尤其在短文本和低资源场景下鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出HyperABSA，利用动态超图框架，通过引入加速-回退截断机制进行样本特定的层次聚类，自适应地构建超边以捕获复杂的语义结构。

Result: 在Lap14、Rest14和MAMS三个基准上实验表明，HyperABSA持续优于强图基线方法，尤其与RoBERTa结合时性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 动态超图构建是一种高效且强大的ABSA解决方案，具有推广至其他短文本NLP任务的潜力。

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity for specific aspect terms, a task made difficult by conflicting sentiments across aspects and the sparse context of short texts. Prior graph-based approaches model only pairwise dependencies, forcing them to construct multiple graphs for different relational views. These introduce redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation during fusion, limiting robustness in short-text, low-resource settings. We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones. These results position dynamic hypergraph construction as an efficient, powerful alternative for ABSA, with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合Transformer关系抽取与知识图谱匹配的方法，用于可追溯的多项选择题回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱构建成本高且静态，难以应对错误事实输入；需提升问答系统的可解释性与准确性。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行关系抽取，将问题句子转化为关系图，并在闭世界假设下与真实知识图谱匹配验证其真实性，从而回答填空式选择题。

Result: 方法在实验中正确回答约70%的问题，且具备过程可追溯性；问题类别对准确率有显著影响。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合动态关系抽取与知识图谱验证，提升了问答系统的可靠性与透明度，适用于需要可解释性的场景。

Abstract: In this research, we combine Transformer-based relation extraction with matching of knowledge graphs (KGs) and apply them to answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) while maintaining the traceability of the output process. KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the "fill-in-the-blank" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.

Abstract: Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.

Abstract: With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becoming more and more prominent in generative AI solutions, there is an emerging need for systematically evaluating their effectiveness. We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.

*Naveen Lamba,Sanju Tiwari,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种首个基于符号语言学知识的幻觉定位框架，揭示了大语言模型中的幻觉本质上是符号语义处理失败，而非普遍生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能系统分析符号性触发词（如否定、数量词等）在模型各层中引发幻觉的机制，缺乏对符号语言知识作用的关注。

Method: 提出一种基于符号语言和语义知识的定位框架，通过分析HaluEval和TruthfulQA数据集上五个模型的注意力方差变化，追踪符号触发词在各层的处理动态。

Result: 发现符号语义处理在早期层（2-4层）即出现注意力方差激增，尤其是否定词导致严重不稳定；深层中符号触发词的注意力急剧下降，且幻觉率居高不下（78.3%-83.7%）。

Conclusion: 幻觉根本上源于符号语言处理的崩溃，符号语义知识是理解和定位幻觉机制的关键。

Abstract: LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

### [153] [Harnessing Deep LLM Participation for Robust Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14181)
*Jiajun Hou,Chenyu Zhang,Rui Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DeepEL，一个将大语言模型（LLM）全面集成到实体链接（EL）各阶段的框架，并引入基于全局上下文的自验证机制，显著提升了EL性能，尤其在跨领域数据上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅将大语言模型应用于实体链接的孤立阶段，未能充分整合其在整个任务中的潜力；同时，孤立地消歧实体不足以实现最佳性能。

Method: 提出DeepEL框架，将大语言模型融入实体链接的每个阶段，并设计一种新的自验证机制，利用全局上下文信息让模型自我修正预测结果，增强实体间关系的识别。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的实验表明，DeepEL平均F1分数提升2.6%，在跨领域数据集上达到4%的显著增益，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 深度集成大语言模型并结合全局上下文自验证机制能有效提升实体链接的整体性能，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL), the task of mapping textual entity mentions to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases, constitutes a fundamental component of natural language understanding. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.
  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.
  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets. These results underscore the efficacy of deep LLM integration in advancing the state-of-the-art in entity linking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语复杂的形态和句法结构使其语法错误纠正更具挑战性，而现有研究多依赖单一模型，未充分利用多系统融合的优势。

Method: 采用AraT5、ByT5、mT5、AraBART等多个模型生成修正候选，将其转化为数值特征，由分类器决定最优修正，并引入支持技术过滤重叠修正并评估决策可靠性。

Result: 在QALB-14测试集上F0.5达到82.63%，QALB-15 L1为84.64%，L2为65.55%，优于单一模型。

Conclusion: ArbESC+是首个集成多种系统的阿拉伯语语法纠错框架，验证了多系统融合的有效性，为阿拉伯语处理工具的发展提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.

Abstract: Large language models perform strongly on general tasks but remain constrained in specialized settings such as music, particularly in the music-entertainment domain, where corpus scale, purity, and the match between data and training objectives are critical. We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field.

Conclusion: Authentic-Dubber通过模拟真实配音中的导演-演员交互，显著提升了自动电影配音的情感表达能力和整体质量，为未来配音系统提供了更贴近实际工作流的解决方案。

Abstract: The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音AI发展迅速，但缺乏针对非洲语言多样性的应用级模型评估工具，限制了该地区语音技术的发展与部署。

Method: 构建AfriSpeech-MultiBench评估套件，涵盖10余国超100种非洲英语口音，在七个应用领域评估多种开源、闭源、单模态ASR与多模态LLM语音系统，使用自发与非自发的非洲口音英语数据进行基准测试。

Result: 开源ASR在自发语音中表现好但在嘈杂、非母语对话中下降明显；多模态LLM对口音更鲁棒但专业命名实体识别差；专有模型在干净语音中准确率高但跨国家和领域表现不稳定；微调模型在非洲英语上具备高精度与低延迟优势，但幻觉问题严重。

Conclusion: AfriSpeech-MultiBench填补了非洲语音技术评估的空白，为面向非洲应用场景的语音系统选择与优化提供了实用基准，推动包容性语音技术发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于熵引导的训练框架，有效解决大推理模型在压缩过程中存在的熵冲突问题，在显著缩短推理链长度的同时保持甚至提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型的思维链过长导致计算成本高、部署困难，现有压缩方法忽略了训练过程中的熵冲突问题。

Method: 采用熵引导的训练框架，在熵下降时鼓励简洁的推理步骤，在熵上升时增强探索能力，以实现高效且鲁棒的压缩推理。

Result: 在六个数学基准上，将推理长度压缩至原来的20%，同时保持或超过基线准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了压缩与性能目标之间的熵冲突，实现了更高效、可部署的推理模型。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同推理策略对大语言模型置信度估计的影响，尤其是如何提升置信度评估的可靠性和透明性。

Method: 引入预测口头化概率分布的方法，要求模型考虑整个答案空间而非单一猜测，并通过分配满足分布要求的置信分数来促进深入推理。

Result: 该方法在不同模型和任务上均优于现有方法，优势在强化学习后仍保持，并显示出与人类期望一致的推理模式。

Conclusion: 预测口头化概率分布能有效提升大模型在置信度估计中的推理质量，是一种通用且鲁棒的改进策略。

Abstract: Knowing the reliability of a model's response is essential in application. With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.

The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

### [161] [ConInstruct: Evaluating Large Language Models on Conflict Detection and Resolution in Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14342)
*Xingwei He,Qianru Zhang,Pengfei Chen,Guanhua Chen,Linlin Yu,Yuan Yuan,Siu-Ming Yiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ConInstruct基准，用于评估大语言模型在用户指令存在冲突约束时的检测与解决能力。研究发现多数专有模型具备较强的冲突检测能力，但开源模型中仅DeepSeek-R1表现优异；然而，即使检测到冲突，模型也很少主动告知用户或寻求澄清。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLM遵循指令的能力，但在复杂提示中指令常包含冲突约束，此场景下的模型行为尚缺乏系统评估。因此，需要专门的基准来探究LLM在冲突情境下的表现。

Method: 构建了一个名为ConInstruct的新基准，用于评估LLM在识别和处理指令冲突方面的能力，并通过实验分析多个模型在冲突检测与响应行为上的表现。

Result: 实验显示，大多数专有LLM具有较强的冲突检测能力（如Claude-4.5-Sonnet F1达87.3%），开源模型中仅DeepSeek-R1表现突出（F1达91.5%）；但无论是否检测到冲突，模型极少主动通知用户或请求澄清。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在处理指令冲突时存在明显不足：尽管部分模型能有效检测冲突，却缺乏与用户沟通的机制。这揭示了指令跟随模型设计中的一个重要改进方向。

Abstract: Instruction-following is a critical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过扩展预训练大语言模型词汇表并继续在化学领域文本上预训练的方法，以解决化学表示中的“分词瓶颈”问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在化学领域的应用常因通用分词器将化学结构（如SMILES）分割成无意义的子词而受限。

Method: 通过有针对性地扩展现有预训练大语言模型的词汇表，加入具有化学意义的标记，并在化学领域文本上进行持续预训练。

Result: 该方法在多个下游化学任务中表现出更优性能，有效缓解了分词瓶颈。

Conclusion: 统一自然语言与分子结构表示的策略可显著提升大语言模型在化学领域的适用性和表现。

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry is frequently hampered by a "tokenization bottleneck", where tokenizers tuned on general-domain text tend to fragment chemical representations such as SMILES into semantically uninformative sub-tokens. This paper introduces a principled methodology to resolve this bottleneck by unifying the representation of natural language and molecular structures within a single model. Our approach involves targeted vocabulary extension-augmenting a pretrained LLM's vocabulary with chemically salient tokens, followed by continued pretraining on chemistry-domain text to integrate this new knowledge. We provide an empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of this strategy, showing that our methodology leads to superior performance on a range of downstream chemical tasks.

Conclusion: ATLAS为评估LLM的高级科学推理能力提供了更可靠、可持续的评测标准，未来将发展为开放、社区驱动的长期平台，助力AGI进展衡量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable "ruler" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

*Mario Sanz-Guerrero,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出归一化上下文校准（NCC）方法，有效缓解大语言模型在多标签长度不一致时的预测偏差，显著提升性能与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在预测候选选项时存在标签长度偏差，现有校准方法未能有效处理多词标签带来的偏见。

Method: 提出归一化 contextual calibration (NCC)，在完整标签级别进行归一化和校准，以纠正不同长度标签的不一致处理。

Result: NCC在多个数据集和模型上显著优于现有方法，F1最高提升达10%，并扩展至多选问答等更广任务；结合上下文学习后，对少样本示例选择更鲁棒，所需示例更少，置信度估计更可靠。

Conclusion: 缓解完整标签层面的偏见对提升大语言模型性能和鲁棒性至关重要，尤其在真实场景中类别标签常为多词的情况下。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注通用安全评估，缺乏针对教育场景特殊安全需求的系统性评估与防护方法。

Method: 构建EduHarm安全评估基准，并提出三阶段防护框架TSSF，包括安全感知注意力重对齐、层间安全判断和防御驱动的双路由机制。

Result: 在八种越狱攻击策略和三个微调攻击数据集上实验表明，TSSF能有效增强安全性，防止良性请求被过度拒绝，并保持良性微调带来的性能增益。

Conclusion: TSSF为教育领域的大语言模型提供了高效且实用的安全防护方案，兼顾安全性与可用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.

*Jinru Ding,Lu Lu,Chao Ding,Mouxiao Bian,Jiayuan Chen,Renjie Lu,Wenrao Pang,Xiaoqin Wu,Zhiqiang Liu,Luyi Jiang,Bing Han,Yunqiu Wang,Jie Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedBench v4是一个覆盖24个主要和91个次要专科的全国性云基准平台，包含超过70万项经专家审阅的临床任务，用于评估医疗大模型、多模态模型和智能体。结果显示基础大模型性能有限，尤其在安全与伦理方面表现较差；多模态模型感知能力强但跨模态推理弱；基于相同底座的智能体显著提升整体表现和安全性。该平台契合中国临床指南与监管要求，为医疗AI的评估提供实用参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医疗AI评估框架难以反映真实临床流程和安全要求，缺乏大规模、细粒度、符合临床实践的评测体系，尤其是在多模态和智能体快速发展的背景下，亟需一个系统化、可扩展且贴近实际应用的评估平台。

Method: 构建MedBench v4基准平台，涵盖70余万项由来自500多家机构的临床医生多轮评审的任务，覆盖24个一级和91个二级专科。采用LLM-as-a-judge方法对开放式回答进行校准评分，并设置针对大语言模型、多模态模型和智能体的专项测试轨道。

Result: 15个前沿模型参与评估：基础大模型平均得分为54.1/100（最高为Claude Sonnet 4.5，62.5/100），但在安全与伦理方面仅18.4/100；多模态模型平均47.5/100（最高GPT-5为54.9/100），具备良好感知能力但跨模态推理较弱；基于相同底座的智能体平均达79.8/100，其中Claude Sonnet 4.5智能体在总体和安全任务上分别达到85.3/100和88.9/100。

Conclusion: 基础医疗大模型在安全和跨模态推理方面存在明显短板，而引入治理意识的智能体架构能显著提升临床就绪水平。MedBench v4通过贴合中国临床指南和监管需求，为医院、开发者和政策制定者提供了可信赖的AI评估工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.

Abstract: We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve complex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档级声明提取的评估方法研究较少，缺乏可靠框架来衡量提取质量，尤其是在非正式语言和强地域背景下。

Method: 通过将两个关于同一文档的声明集进行对齐，计算其对齐得分，探索最佳对齐方式和评估方法，以构建可靠的评估框架。

Result: 实验表明现有评估方法在捕捉语义相似性和关键声明属性方面存在局限，新方法能更有效地评估提取性能和标注一致性。

Conclusion: 需要更先进的评估方法来准确反映文档级声明提取的质量，特别是在复杂语言环境下。

Abstract: Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

We show that this phenomenon is common across seven diverse languages and supports multi-document summarization. To scale data collection, we develop an automatic process, suited to varying linguistic resource levels. Finally, we apply this process to a Hebrew newspaper title, producing HEBTEASESUM, the first dedicated multi-document summarization dataset in Hebrew.

TL;DR: 该研究利用电子健康记录数据，通过纵向追踪急性肾损伤（AKI）患者的临床演变，识别出15种不同的临床状态，并发现不同状态下患者进展为慢性肾病（CKD）的风险各异。结合多状态模型和生存分析，揭示了已知及新的CKD风险因素在不同亚群中的影响差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别AKI后进展为CKD的高风险患者仍具挑战性，亟需一种动态、数据驱动的方法来刻画AKI向CKD的演进过程并精准预测风险。

Method: 基于EHR数据，使用纵向医疗编码和肌酐值构建患者向量，通过聚类识别post-AKI临床状态；采用多状态模型估计状态转移概率和CKD进展风险，并通过生存分析识别不同AKI亚群中的CKD危险因素。

Result: 在20,699名住院AKI患者中，17%（3,491人）发展为CKD；共识别出15个不同的post-AKI临床状态，75%的患者保持在一个状态或仅发生一次状态转移；发现了包括AKI严重程度、糖尿病等已知及若干新型CKD风险因素，其影响因临床状态而异。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种数据驱动的动态分层方法，可有效识别AKI后高风险CKD患者，有助于开发支持早期检测与干预的临床决策工具。

Abstract: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在政治偏见检测任务中与人类判断的一致性程度，填补当前对模型与人类感知差异理解的空白。

Method: 构建人工标注的新闻文章数据集，评估标注一致性、偏见极性及模型间一致性，比较包括GPT、BERT、RoBERTa和FLAN在内的多种模型在零样本和微调设置下的表现。

Result: RoBERTa在传统模型中与人类标签对齐度最高；GPT在零样本条件下整体一致性最强；微调后的RoBERTa在准确率和人类标签对齐方面表现最优。

Conclusion: 人类与大语言模型在感知政治倾向上存在系统性差异，未来应发展融合人类判断与模型自动化的混合评估方法以提升媒体偏见检测的可靠性。

Abstract: Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

Motivation: 罕见病诊断通常耗时数年，现有方法在证据提取与诊断推理上脱节，且通用或医学大语言模型面临真实电子健康记录稀缺、领域知识陈旧和幻觉等问题，亟需更可靠、可审计的诊断支持系统。

Method: 构建大规模领域专用临床语料库和经医生验证的推理数据集，采用分阶段指令微调、思维链学习和基于图的检索增强技术开发 RareSeek R1 模型。

Result: 在多中心电子病历文本和公开基准测试中，RareSeek R1 实现了最先进的诊断准确率，具备强泛化能力和噪声鲁棒性；检索增强显著提升诊断表现，尤其在表型重叠或模糊情况下；人类研究表明其性能与资深医师相当，并能在辅助诊断中持续提升医生表现；透明化推理揭示中位数 23.1% 的关键非表型证据（如影像、功能检测）对正确诊断的支持作用。

Conclusion: RareSeek R1 推动了以临床叙事为核心、融合领域知识的推理范式，有效缩短罕见病诊断旅程，提供可审计、可转化的临床决策支持。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.

### [174] [Graded strength of comparative illusions is explained by Bayesian inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14642)
*Yuhan Zhang,Erxiao Wang,Cory Shain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合统计语言模型与人类行为数据，构建了一个量化模型来预测比较错觉（CI）的强度，支持了句子理解中的噪声通道理论，并解释了CI效应的细微差异及代词与完整名词短语对错觉的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较错觉（如“去过俄罗斯的学生比我多”）看似合理实则逻辑荒谬，研究旨在揭示人们为何系统性误判此类句子，并检验噪声通道理论是否能解释这一现象。

Method: 在贝叶斯噪声通道框架下，结合统计语言模型与人类行为数据，量化计算不同解释的后验概率，并预测CI错觉强度，尤其比较代词与完整名词短语作为从句主语时的差异。

Result: 模型成功预测了CI错觉的强度梯度，并解释了先前未被说明的代词与名词短语主语之间的效应差异，验证了噪声通道理论的预测能力。

Conclusion: 研究为语言理解中的噪声通道理论提供了有力支持，表明该理论可统一解释包括错觉在内的多种语言处理现象。

Abstract: Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.

Motivation: 解决NLP数据集中因文化多样性导致的注释偏见问题，以减少多语言大模型中的社会危害。

Method: 提出一个包含偏见类型学、检测指标综述和适用于多语言环境的集成式偏见缓解方法的框架，并进行伦理分析。

Result: 系统梳理了注释偏见的分类与检测方法，提出了主动与被动的缓解策略，并开发了面向多语言场景的新型缓解方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于构建更公平、更具文化敏感性的多语言大模型注释流程。

Abstract: Annotation bias in NLP datasets remains a major challenge for developing multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in culturally diverse settings. Bias from task framing, annotator subjectivity, and cultural mismatches can distort model outputs and exacerbate social harms. We propose a comprehensive framework for understanding annotation bias, distinguishing among instruction bias, annotator bias, and contextual and cultural bias. We review detection methods (including inter-annotator agreement, model disagreement, and metadata analysis) and highlight emerging techniques such as multilingual model divergence and cultural inference. We further outline proactive and reactive mitigation strategies, including diverse annotator recruitment, iterative guideline refinement, and post-hoc model adjustments. Our contributions include: (1) a typology of annotation bias; (2) a synthesis of detection metrics; (3) an ensemble-based bias mitigation approach adapted for multilingual settings, and (4) an ethical analysis of annotation processes. Together, these insights aim to inform more equitable and culturally grounded annotation pipelines for LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的模块化框架，用于自动化合同管理中的条款修订流程，在低资源现实条件下实现了超过80%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合同管理中缺乏标注数据且存在大量非结构化历史合同，传统方法难以有效识别和优化问题性修订，因此需要一种可扩展、高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG） pipeline，结合合成数据生成、语义条款检索、可接受性分类和基于奖励的对齐机制，以识别问题修订并生成改进版本。

Result: 系统在识别和优化问题修订方面均达到80%以上的准确率，在真实低资源场景下表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效加速合同修订流程，具备实际应用价值，尤其适用于数据稀缺的行业环境。

Abstract: Contract management involves reviewing and negotiating provisions, individual clauses that define rights, obligations, and terms of agreement. During this process, revisions to provisions are proposed and iteratively refined, some of which may be problematic or unacceptable. Automating this workflow is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data and the abundance of unstructured legacy contracts. In this paper, we present a modular framework designed to streamline contract management through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system integrates synthetic data generation, semantic clause retrieval, acceptability classification, and reward-based alignment to flag problematic revisions and generate improved alternatives. Developed and evaluated in collaboration with an industry partner, our system achieves over 80% accuracy in both identifying and optimizing problematic revisions, demonstrating strong performance under real-world, low-resource conditions and offering a practical means of accelerating contract revision workflows.

*Oscar Fontanelli,Wentian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Heaps定律在对数-对数尺度下的非线性特征，发现二次函数比幂律更精确地拟合词符与词型的关系，并通过“从袋中随机抽取带替换彩球”模型解释了曲率的来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Heaps定律通常用幂律描述词符与词型关系，但在对数-对数尺度下仍表现出轻微凹性，表明幂律假设不完全成立，因此需要更高阶的近似来准确建模。

Method: 分析二十部英文小说或文本（部分为翻译作品）的词符-词型数据，在对数-对数尺度下使用包含线性和二次项的回归模型进行拟合，并引入‘随机抽球’模型解释曲率的数学本质。

Result: 在对数-对数尺度下，二次函数能完美拟合类型-词符数据；回归结果显示线性系数略大于1，二次系数约为-0.02；‘随机抽球’模型揭示曲率等价于负的‘伪方差’，适用于小样本情况下的曲率估计。

Conclusion: Heaps定律在对数-对数尺度下的偏差可通过二次项修正，词型增长的非线性特性可用负伪方差概念解释，为文本复杂度和词汇多样性提供了更精确的建模方法。

Abstract: Heaps' or Herdan's law characterizes the word-type vs. word-token relation by a power-law function, which is concave in linear-linear scale but a straight line in log-log scale. However, it has been observed that even in log-log scale, the type-token curve is still slightly concave, invalidating the power-law relation. At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance" which is negative. Although a pseudo-variance calculation may encounter numeric instability when the number of tokens is large, due to the large values of pseudo-weights, this formalism provides a rough estimation of the curvature when the number of tokens is small.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在数学推理中易出错且缺乏类似教师的系统性纠错机制，难以满足教育应用需求。

Method: 将学生数学推理建模为多步决策问题，引入MCTS探索最优纠错路径，并利用LLM引导的BFS与答案评估生成过程级奖励，通过反向传播分配至各步骤。

Conclusion: SMRC实现了更符合教育实际的推理纠错，提升了大模型在教学场景中的适用性和可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often make reasoning errors when solving mathematical problems, and how to automatically detect and correct these errors has become an important research direction. However, existing approaches \textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{SMRC} (\textit{\underline{S}tudent \underline{M}athematical \underline{R}easoning \underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \textbf{solution accuracy} and \textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型如何利用文本描述编码通常只能通过科学测量获得的物理信息，特别是在不同提示条件下和语言特征对编码物理量的影响。

Method: 采用稀疏自编码器从文本中提取可解释特征，分析不同提示对LLM编码物理量的影响，并探究哪些语言特征在编码物理信息中最重要。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够通过适当的提示和关键语言特征有效编码物理信息，展示了其在科学数据理解和表示方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated the ability to generalize well at many levels across domains, modalities, and even shown in-context learning capabilities. This enables research questions regarding how they can be used to encode physical information that is usually only available from scientific measurements, and loosely encoded in textual descriptions. Using astrophysics as a test bed, we investigate if LLM embeddings can codify physical summary statistics that are obtained from scientific measurements through two main questions: 1) Does prompting play a role on how those quantities are codified by the LLM? and 2) What aspects of language are most important in encoding the physics represented by the measurement? We investigate this using sparse autoencoders that extract interpretable features from the text.

Abstract: Historical and low-resource NLP remains challenging due to limited annotated data and domain mismatches with modern, web-sourced corpora. This paper outlines our work in using large language models (LLMs) to create ground-truth annotations for historical French (16th-20th centuries) and Chinese (1900-1950) texts. By leveraging LLM-generated ground truth on a subset of our corpus, we were able to fine-tune spaCy to achieve significant gains on period-specific tests for part-of-speech (POS) annotations, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER). Our results underscore the importance of domain-specific models and demonstrate that even relatively limited amounts of synthetic data can improve NLP tools for under-resourced corpora in computational humanities research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投诉分析方法主要依赖单模态短文本（如推文或评论），难以捕捉复杂投诉中跨模态的信息；本文旨在利用包含文本与图像的多轮客户对话，提升投诉理解的细粒度与准确性。

Method: 提出VALOR框架，采用多专家生成模型结合思维链提示（CoT）进行推理，引入语义对齐评分并通过元融合策略整合多模态信息，实现细粒度投诉方面与严重性分类。

Result: 在标注了细粒度方面与严重性标签的多模态投诉数据集上，VALOR显著优于基线模型，尤其在文本与图像分布复杂信息的场景下表现更优。

Conclusion: 多模态交互与专家验证机制能有效提升实际投诉理解系统的性能，VALOR为构建智能、可扩展的服务基础设施提供了可行方案，并有助于推动负责任消费与产业创新等可持续发展目标。

Abstract: Existing approaches to complaint analysis largely rely on unimodal, short-form content such as tweets or product reviews. This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images. This study underscores the value of multimodal interaction and expert validation in practical complaint understanding systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了库尔德语词嵌入的分词策略，比较了基于词、词素和BPE的方法，发现传统评估方式存在覆盖率偏差，而基于词素的分词在综合评估下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源语言（如库尔德语）中，如何有效进行分词以保留形态学信息并构建高质量的词嵌入仍是一个挑战，现有评估方法可能因忽略覆盖率而产生偏差。

Method: 开发了一个基于少量人工标注、通过自举法训练的BiLSTM-CRF形态分割器，并使用Word2Vec生成不同分词策略下的词嵌入，从相似性保持、聚类质量和语义组织等多个指标进行全面评估。

Result: BPE在初始评估中表现较好，但仅覆盖28.6%的测试用例，而词素模型覆盖68.7%，显示出BPE性能被高估；在全面评估下，词素分词在嵌入空间组织、语义邻域结构和形态复杂度覆盖上均优于BPE和词级分词。

Conclusion: 在低资源语言处理中，应采用考虑覆盖率的评估方式，基于词素的分词方法在形态丰富语言中能更有效地组织语义信息，是更优选择。

Abstract: We investigate tokenization strategies for Kurdish word embeddings by comparing word-level, morpheme-based, and BPE approaches on morphological similarity preservation tasks. We develop a BiLSTM-CRF morphological segmenter using bootstrapped training from minimal manual annotation and evaluate Word2Vec embeddings across comprehensive metrics including similarity preservation, clustering quality, and semantic organization. Our analysis reveals critical evaluation biases in tokenization comparison. While BPE initially appears superior in morphological similarity, it evaluates only 28.6\% of test cases compared to 68.7\% for morpheme model, creating artificial performance inflation. When assessed comprehensively, morpheme-based tokenization demonstrates superior embedding space organization, better semantic neighborhood structure, and more balanced coverage across morphological complexity levels. These findings highlight the importance of coverage-aware evaluation in low-resource language processing and offers different tokenization methods for low-resourced language processing.

TL;DR: 提出B2F模型，通过解耦内容与风格表征，生成与身体动作一致且符合指定风格的面部动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟角色的面部表情若与身体动作不协调，会削弱整体感知；因此需要生成与身体动作对齐的面部运动。

Method: 采用Gumbel-Softmax学习离散潜在码表示风格，结合对齐和一致性目标，实现内容与风格的解耦建模，并输出FLAME格式面部动画，支持SMPL-X和ARKit avatar。

Result: 实验表明B2F能生成富有表现力且与身体动作同步的面部动画，减少感知失调，具有良好的跨角色和跨风格泛化能力。

Conclusion: B2F有效实现了风格化且与身体动作一致的面部动画生成，提升了虚拟角色动作的整体感知一致性。

Abstract: Human motion naturally integrates body movements and facial expressions, forming a unified perception. If a virtual character's facial expression does not align well with its body movements, it may weaken the perception of the character as a cohesive whole. Motivated by this, we propose B2F, a model that generates facial motions aligned with body movements. B2F takes a facial style reference as input, generating facial animations that reflect the provided style while maintaining consistency with the associated body motion. To achieve this, B2F learns a disentangled representation of content and style, using alignment and consistency-based objectives. We represent style using discrete latent codes learned via the Gumbel-Softmax trick, enabling diverse expression generation with a structured latent representation. B2F outputs facial motion in the FLAME format, making it compatible with SMPL-X characters, and supports ARKit-style avatars through a dedicated conversion module. Our evaluations show that B2F generates expressive and engaging facial animations that synchronize with body movements and style intent, while mitigating perceptual dissonance from mismatched cues, and generalizing across diverse characters and styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖运动捕捉数据，限制了在非人或合成形态上的应用；希望在无动作数据的情况下实现通用、自适应的运动控制。

Method: 采用肌肉骨骼模型作为强先验，通过模型驱动的强化学习联合学习潜在表示与控制策略，并引入时均损失函数和目标随机化以提升周期性运动表现和行为多样性。

Result: 在多种形态（如人形、类人猿、四足）上实现了多样且物理合理的运动行为，能自然演化出高效的步态，并支持目标导航等下游任务。

Conclusion: FreeMusco证明了无需动作数据也能涌现出灵活、适应性强的运动控制，为难以获取动作数据的角色运动模拟提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose FreeMusco, a motion-free framework that jointly learns latent representations and control policies for musculoskeletal characters. By leveraging the musculoskeletal model as a strong prior, our method enables energy-aware and morphology-adaptive locomotion to emerge without motion data. The framework generalizes across human, non-human, and synthetic morphologies, where distinct energy-efficient strategies naturally appear--for example, quadrupedal gaits in Chimanoid versus bipedal gaits in Humanoid. The latent space and corresponding control policy are constructed from scratch, without demonstration, and enable downstream tasks such as goal navigation and path following--representing, to our knowledge, the first motion-free method to provide such capabilities. FreeMusco learns diverse and physically plausible locomotion behaviors through model-based reinforcement learning, guided by the locomotion objective that combines control, balancing, and biomechanical terms. To better capture the periodic structure of natural gait, we introduce the temporally averaged loss formulation, which compares simulated and target states over a time window rather than on a per-frame basis. We further encourage behavioral diversity by randomizing target poses and energy levels during training, enabling locomotion to be flexibly modulated in both form and intensity at runtime. Together, these results demonstrate that versatile and adaptive locomotion control can emerge without motion capture, offering a new direction for simulating movement in characters where data collection is impractical or impossible.

Abstract: Dense retrieval, as the core component of e-commerce search engines, maps user queries and items into a unified semantic space through pre-trained embedding models to enable large-scale real-time semantic retrieval. Despite the rapid advancement of LLMs gradually replacing traditional BERT architectures for embedding, their training paradigms still adhere to BERT-like supervised fine-tuning and hard negative mining strategies. This approach relies on complex offline hard negative sample construction pipelines, which constrain model iteration efficiency and hinder the evolutionary potential of semantic representation capabilities. Besides, existing multi-task learning frameworks face the seesaw effect when simultaneously optimizing semantic relevance and non-relevance objectives. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-GRPO, a multi-objective reinforcement learning-based dense retrieval framework designed to address these challenges. The method eliminates offline hard negative sample construction by dynamically retrieving Top-K candidate products for each query during training, while introducing a relevance LLM as a reward model to generate real-time feedback. Specifically, the retrieval model dynamically optimizes embedding representations through reinforcement learning, with reward signals combining LLM-generated relevance scores, product quality scores, and multi-way exclusivity metrics to achieve multi-objective user preference alignment and real-time error correction. This mechanism not only removes dependency on hard negatives but also mitigates the seesaw effect through collaborative multi-objective optimization, significantly enhancing the model's semantic generalization capability for complex long-tail queries. Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of Retrieval-GRPO, which has been deployed on China's largest e-commerce platform.

Conclusion: NeuroPath有效提升了多跳问答中的语义连贯性和检索精度，通过模拟神经生物路径导航机制为RAG提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) greatly enhances large language models (LLMs) performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.

Abstract: Recommender systems play a vital role in alleviating information overload and enriching users' online experience. In the era of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based recommender systems have emerged as a prevalent paradigm for advancing personalized recommendations. Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has drawn growing interest to facilitate the recommendation capability of LLMs, incorporating useful information retrieved from external knowledge bases. However, as a rich source of up-to-date information, the web remains under-explored by existing RAG-based recommendations. In particular, unique challenges are posed from two perspectives: one is to generate effective queries for web retrieval, considering the inherent knowledge gap between web search and recommendations; another challenge lies in harnessing online websites that contain substantial noisy content. To tackle these limitations, we propose WebRec, a novel web-based RAG framework, which takes advantage of the reasoning capability of LLMs to interpret recommendation tasks into queries of user preferences that cater to web retrieval. Moreover, given noisy web-retrieved information, where relevant pieces of evidence are scattered far apart, an insightful MP-Head is designed to enhance LLM attentions between distant tokens of relevant information via message passing. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed web-based RAG methods in recommendation scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced text-based recommendation by enriching traditional ID-based methods with semantic generalization capabilities. Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models. Ablation studies, visualizations, and case studies further validate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在训练和推理阶段存在不对称性，限制了生成范式在CTR预测中的潜力。

Method: 设计SGCTR框架，在训练阶段学习特征依赖关系获得生成能力，在推理阶段迭代重构输入特征以抑制噪声影响。

Result: 实验表明，SGCTR在训练和推理阶段对称使用生成范式显著提升了CTR预测性能。

Conclusion: SGCTR有效释放了生成范式的潜力，实现了更准确的CTR预测。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly being explored in click-through rate (CTR) prediction field to overcome the limitations of the conventional discriminative paradigm, which rely on a simple binary classification objective. However, existing generative models typically confine the generative paradigm to the training phase, primarily for representation learning. During online inference, they revert to a standard discriminative paradigm, failing to leverage their powerful generative capabilities to further improve prediction accuracy. This fundamental asymmetry between the training and inference phases prevents the generative paradigm from realizing its full potential. To address this limitation, we propose the Symmetric Masked Generative Paradigm for CTR prediction (SGCTR), a novel framework that establishes symmetry between the training and inference phases. Specifically, after acquiring generative capabilities by learning feature dependencies during training, SGCTR applies the generative capabilities during online inference to iteratively redefine the features of input samples, which mitigates the impact of noisy features and enhances prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of SGCTR, demonstrating that applying the generative paradigm symmetrically across both training and inference significantly unlocks its power in CTR prediction.

Abstract: This technical report presents the training methodology and evaluation results of the open-source Jasper-Token-Compression-600M model, released in November 2025. Building on previous distillation-based recipes from the English Stella and Jasper models, we successfully extend this approach to a bilingual (English and Chinese) domain, further enhancing model performance through the incorporation of contrastive learning. A key innovation of our model is the introduction of a one-dimensional convolution-based token compression module. We dynamically adjust the compression rate during training, enabling the model to learn more robust and efficient compressed text representations. By combining knowledge distillation with token compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in both embedding quality and inference efficiency. Our model performs with higher efficiency than a traditional 0.6B model while achieving performance comparable to that of an 8B model.

Abstract: Using multiple carousels, lists that wrap around and can be scrolled, is the basis for offering content in most contemporary movie streaming platforms. Carousels allow for highlighting different aspects of users' taste, that fall in categories such as genres and authors. However, while carousels offer structure and greater ease of navigation, they alone do not increase diversity in recommendations, while this is essential to keep users engaged. In this work we propose several approaches to effectively increase item diversity within the domain of book recommendations, on top of a collaborative filtering algorithm. These approaches are intended to improve book recommendations in the web catalogs of public libraries. Furthermore, we introduce metrics to evaluate the resulting strategies, and show that the proposed system finds a suitable balance between accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects.

Abstract: To measure advances in retrieval, test collections with relevance judgments that can faithfully distinguish systems are required. This paper presents NeuCLIRBench, an evaluation collection for cross-language and multilingual retrieval. The collection consists of documents written natively in Chinese, Persian, and Russian, as well as those same documents machine translated into English. The collection supports several retrieval scenarios including: monolingual retrieval in English, Chinese, Persian, or Russian; cross-language retrieval with English as the query language and one of the other three languages as the document language; and multilingual retrieval, again with English as the query language and relevant documents in all three languages. NeuCLIRBench combines the TREC NeuCLIR track topics of 2022, 2023, and 2024. The 250,128 judgments across approximately 150 queries for the monolingual and cross-language tasks and 100 queries for multilingual retrieval provide strong statistical discriminatory power to distinguish retrieval approaches. A fusion baseline of strong neural retrieval systems is included with the collection so that developers of reranking algorithms are no longer reliant on BM25 as their first-stage retriever. NeuCLIRBench is publicly available.

*Samuel Nathanson,Rebecca Williams,Cynthia Matuszek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，在多智能体交互中，攻击者与目标模型的相对大小显著影响越狱成功率，较大的攻击者模型更可能使较小的目标模型产生有害输出，且攻击方的对齐程度对减少危害具有关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在多智能体、安全关键场景下的可扩展性漏洞，特别是较大模型是否能系统性地突破较小模型的安全对齐机制。

Method: 基于JailbreakBench标准对抗任务，模拟6000多次跨规模（0.6B-120B参数）和家族的LLM攻防交互，使用三个独立LLM裁判评估每次交互的伤害得分和拒绝行为。

Result: 发现平均伤害得分与攻击者/目标模型大小比值的对数呈显著正相关（Pearson r=0.51），攻击方行为多样性对结果影响大于目标方脆弱性，且攻击者拒绝频率与伤害得分强负相关（rho=-0.93）。

Conclusion: 模型尺寸不对称性影响对抗鲁棒性，攻击者规模和对齐程度是决定多模型系统安全的关键因素，提示需进一步研究跨模型对齐与安全缩放规律。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于扩展物理信息神经网络（XPINN）的方法，用于求解具有非凸通量函数的非线性Buckley-Leverett方程，通过时空域的动态分解和Rankine-Hugoniot跳跃条件耦合，有效捕捉间断饱和锋面和复合波相互作用，相比标准PINN具有更高稳定性、更快收敛性和更少参数需求。

Conclusion: XPINN是一种高效、可扩展的工具，适用于求解多相流中的复杂双曲型偏微分方程，为处理强非线性、含间断的PDE提供了新思路。

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems. The code of this work is available on github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.

Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法在将GPS轨迹转换为网格或道路表示时会丢失细粒度的时空细节，因此需要一种能同时捕捉高层语义和精细时空特征的方法。

Method: 提出BLUE方法，通过逐步降低GPS坐标的精度生成多层次的轨迹块；采用编码器-解码器结构的Transformer模型，结合池化和上采样机制，在不同层次间互补信息，并通过轨迹重建任务和MSE损失进行训练。

Result: 在三个下游任务中与8种SOTA方法比较，BLUE consistently 在准确率上超过所有基线方法，平均优于最佳基线30.90%。

Conclusion: BLUE有效平衡了轨迹数据的高层语义提取与细粒度时空信息保留，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

Motivation: 深度神经网络易受对抗性扰动影响，现有防御方法在面对复杂攻击时仍存在不足，因此需要一种更有效且通用的防御机制。

Method: 提出DeepDefense框架，采用跨多层的梯度-特征对齐（GFA）正则化，使输入梯度与内部特征表示对齐，从而平滑切向方向的损失景观，降低模型对对抗噪声的敏感性。

Result: 理论分析表明GFA能有效抑制切向方向上的损失变化；实验显示在CIFAR-10上，相比标准对抗训练，APGD攻击下性能提升达15.2%，FGSM攻击下提升24.7%；对DeepFool和EADEN等优化攻击，需20至30倍更高的扰动幅度才能导致误分类。

Conclusion: DeepDefense是一种架构无关、易于实现且高效的对抗防御方法，通过构建更平坦的损失景观和更强的决策边界，为提升深度模型的对抗鲁棒性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which are small and carefully crafted inputs that lead to incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.
  We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape. Our approach is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, offering a promising direction for improving the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.

Conclusion: Fair-GNE提供了一种原则性强、可验证的公平性实施机制，适用于大规模基于学习的多智能体医疗系统。

Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分析扩散模型中的社会偏见时受限于预定义类别或依赖人工解释，难以发现细微或未预期的偏见模式，因此需要更可扩展和自动化的分析方法。

Method: SCALEX从H-space中利用自然语言提示自动提取语义上有意义的潜在方向，实现零样本解释，并支持跨概念的系统比较和大规模模型内部关联的发现。

Result: SCALEX成功检测到职业提示中的性别偏见，对身份描述符的语义一致性进行排序，并在无监督情况下揭示了概念结构的聚类。

Conclusion: SCALEX通过将提示直接映射到潜在方向，使扩散模型中的偏见分析更具可扩展性、可解释性和可扩展性，优于以往方法。

Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.
  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.

Abstract: A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) connects the human brain to the outside world, providing a direct communication channel. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method was validated on publicly available benchmark EEG datasets (IVA and I) from the BCI competition III and IV. The results show that the approach outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 90.77% and 84.50% for datasets IVA and I, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统分析了基于大语言模型（LLM）的车辆轨迹预测在自动驾驶中的对抗性脆弱性，提出一种单特征差分进化攻击方法，在黑箱环境下通过微小且物理合理的扰动显著干扰模型输出，揭示了准确性与鲁棒性之间的权衡，并探讨了潜在的缓解策略。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管LLM在自动驾驶决策中展现出潜力，但其在安全关键系统中的鲁棒性和可信度尚未得到充分探索，尤其是在对抗性攻击下的脆弱性问题亟待研究。

Method: 提出一种针对LLM输入提示中单一运动学特征的差分进化攻击方法，在黑箱设置下对周围车辆的数据进行微小扰动，并在highD数据集上评估其对预测性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，即使是非常轻微且符合物理实际的输入扰动，也能显著破坏LLM的预测输出，暴露出此类模型在对抗性攻击面前的高度敏感性，同时发现了准确性与鲁棒性之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的车辆轨迹预测模型存在严重对抗性漏洞，未来智能交通系统的设计必须重视鲁棒性增强机制，以确保自动驾驶系统的安全性与可靠性。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

*Abolfazl Younesi,Leon Kiss,Zahra Najafabadi Samani,Juan Aznar Poveda,Thomas Fahringer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出FLARE，一种自适应的基于声誉的联邦学习防御框架，通过多维信任评估、自校准阈值、加权聚合和本地差分隐私，有效抵御包括新型统计模仿攻击在内的多种拜占庭攻击，在保持低开销的同时显著提升模型鲁棒性和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习防御机制依赖静态阈值和二元判断，难以应对动态和复杂的恶意客户端攻击行为，尤其在面对自适应、隐蔽性强的攻击时表现不足，因此需要更灵活、细粒度的可靠性评估方法。

Method: 提出FLARE框架，包含四部分：1）多维声誉评分（性能一致性、统计异常、时间行为）；2）自校准自适应阈值机制；3）基于声誉的加权聚合与软排除；4）结合本地差分隐私的声誉评分。同时设计了一种新型隐蔽攻击——统计模仿攻击（SM），用于测试防御能力。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上，100个客户端的实验表明，FLARE在多种攻击下（如标签翻转、梯度缩放、ALIE、SM等）比现有最先进方法具有更高的准确率和更快的收敛速度，鲁棒性最高提升16%，收敛性保持在无攻击基准的30%以内，且具备良好的恶意客户端检测能力与低计算开销。

Conclusion: FLARE通过连续、多维度的声誉机制实现了对恶意客户端的高效、自适应防御，解决了传统二元判断和静态阈值的局限性，提升了联邦学习在复杂攻击环境下的安全性和实用性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信息瓶颈原理的自适应冗余调节方法RedReg，用于平衡多模态信息优化，有效缓解模态偏差和冗余信息积累问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态训练中难以应对模态偏差导致的优化不平衡问题，且忽视模态间语义与方向性，导致冗余信息积累和表示-输出耦合减弱。

Result: 实验表明，RedReg在多数场景下优于当前主流方法，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: RedReg通过自适应调节多模态冗余信息，实现了更均衡的优化，提升了多模态学习性能，具有良好的适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度格网络（DLN）的非参数概率预测方法，用于时间序列中的隐式累积分布函数（CDF）预测，通过单调约束避免分位数交叉问题，并在太阳能辐照度预测中表现出优越性能。

Motivation: 传统点预测难以捕捉时间序列中的突变，而概率预测能更好地反映不确定性；现有分位回归方法常出现分位数交叉问题，需引入单调约束以生成合法的CDF。

Result: 在日前三小时太阳能辐照度预测任务中，该方法表现优于或相当于现有无约束方法，并优于可比的单调神经网络模型。

Conclusion: DLN的适应性改进能有效支持非参数、完整且隐式的CDF预测，为概率预测与单调神经网络的融合提供了新方向。

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.

This framework reflects the real-world complexities of clinical practice, minimizing reliance on extensive preprocessing and incorporating masked loss techniques for robust and unbiased model evaluation. By providing a standardized and unified platform for model development and comparison, VitalBench enables researchers to focus on architectural innovation while ensuring consistency in data handling. This work lays the foundation for advancing predictive models for intraoperative vital sign forecasting, ensuring that these models are not only accurate but also robust and adaptable across diverse clinical environments.

Abstract: Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.

Abstract: Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法在面对真实场景中的混合、异构分布偏移时表现不佳，因其依赖统一的适应路径且缺乏对多样化梯度方向的建模能力，同时当前基准未能充分反映现实复杂性。

Method: 提出MoETTA，结合基于熵的机制与混合专家（MoE）架构，引入结构解耦的多个专家网络，使不同测试样本可沿不同梯度方向进行自适应更新，并构建新基准potpourri和potpourri+以评估在自然、艺术化及对抗性等多种混合偏移下的性能。

Result: 在三种混合分布偏移设置下，MoETTA显著优于现有强基线方法，在标准TTA和抗灾难性遗忘任务中均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过专家级多样性建模多适应路径可有效提升模型在复杂、混合分布偏移下的鲁棒性，MoETTA为现实场景中的自适应提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

Abstract: Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

Abstract: The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

Motivation: 现有离线模仿学习方法常假设轨迹与专家演示的相似性正相关于奖励，忽略了复杂的奖励结构，缺乏对奖励函数的有效评估与优化机制。

Method: 提出 PROF 框架，利用大语言模型生成奖励函数代码，并引入 Reward Preference Ranking (RPR) 方法通过计算支配分数对奖励函数进行排序和优化，结合文本梯度更新实现自动迭代改进。

Result: 在 D4RL 多个数据集和领域上的实验表明，PROF 性能优于或媲美当前先进基线方法。

Conclusion: PROF 通过结合大语言模型与无需环境交互的奖励函数评估机制，有效提升了离线模仿学习中奖励函数的准确性与策略学习性能。

Abstract: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

Conclusion: 动态调整温度能更好适应训练过程，DTS是首个基于师生分布差异自适应调节温度的方法，具有广泛适用性和即插即用特性。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

*Joey Velez-Ginorio,Nada Amin,Konrad Kording,Steve Zdancewic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Cajal，一种用于直接编程神经网络的类型化、高阶、线性编程语言，通过将离散算法编译为可微形式，实现与梯度学习兼容，提升学习效率和可调试性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经网络依赖数据驱动的学习算法（如梯度下降），缺乏对离散结构的支持，难以将已有算法直接编入网络，限制了网络的设计灵活性和性能。

Method: 设计并实现了一种名为Cajal的编程语言，其程序可被证明能编译为线性神经元，从而在保持可微性的同时表达离散算法，并将其与其他神经网络连接以预先确定部分功能。

Result: 实验表明，使用Cajal生成的线性神经元连接其他网络，可加快学习速度、提高数据利用效率，并增强模型的可调试性。

Conclusion: 线性编程语言为直接编程神经网络提供了可行路径，促进了学习过程与传统编程中离散结构的深度融合。

Abstract: We don't program neural networks directly. Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.

*Nihal Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过将自注意力机制与分布语义学原理联系起来，提出了一种数学解释，表明Transformer架构的代数形式源于投影原则，而非任意设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释自注意力机制背后的数学原理，并揭示Transformer架构设计的理论基础。

Method: 从GloVe嵌入背后的共现矩阵出发，通过将语料库级别的共现统计信息投影到序列上下文中，推导出自注意力机制及其变体（如查询-键-值机制、位置编码和多头注意力）。

Result: 证明了自注意力机制自然地从共现统计的上下文投影中产生，查询-键-值机制是对称关系建模的自然非对称扩展，位置编码和多头注意力则是该投影原则的结构化改进。

Conclusion: Transformer架构特有的代数形式源于共现统计的上下文投影原则，这为理解其设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by connecting it to distributional semantics principles. We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种任务冲突校准（TC$^2$）方法，通过元学习范式构建批量内的多个SSL任务，利用因果生成因子和样本权重来缓解任务冲突，提升表示的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督学习（SSL）中表示的可迁移性及其建模方式，解决因任务冲突导致的迁移性能受限问题。

Method: 在每个训练批次内构建多个SSL任务，引入任务级信息；设计因子提取网络和权重提取网络，结合数据重构、正交性和稀疏性约束，通过双阶段双层优化框架在校准样本表示的同时优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，TC$^2$在多个下游任务上显著提升了SSL模型的表示可迁移性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TC$^2$有效缓解了SSL中的任务冲突，为建模和提升表示可迁移性提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the transferability of SSL by addressing two central questions: (i) what is the representation transferability of SSL, and (ii) how can we effectively model this transferability? Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.
  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the transferability of SSL models.

TL;DR: 提出一种可微分的全局可解释性方法，将特征重要性估计嵌入模型训练过程，实现高保真、稳定且快速的特征排序，同时提升模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后解释方法与模型训练过程脱节，导致解释不够忠实和可靠，难以满足对透明可信系统的需要。

Method: 引入ScoresActivation函数，作为嵌入学习流程的特征排序机制，通过端到端可训练的方式在训练过程中直接进行特征重要性评估。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了该方法生成的特征排序具有全局保真性和稳定性，与SHAP值和真实特征重要性高度一致；特征评分速度比SHAP快150倍（2秒 vs 300秒）；并在不同特征配置下分别提升分类准确率11.24%和29.33%。

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了模型准确性与可解释性之间的鸿沟，提供了一种可扩展的内生可解释机器学习框架。

Abstract: Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DAS（Distribution Aware Speculative decoding）框架，通过利用历史rollout信息和自适应推测解码策略，显著加速大语言模型的强化学习后训练中的rollout阶段，最高减少50%的生成时间，同时保持训练效果不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习后训练中，rollout阶段生成长序列效率低下，且受长尾分布影响严重，少量长序列主导了整体耗时；同时存在可利用的历史rollout数据中的稳定模式。

Method: 提出DAS框架：1）基于近期rollout使用后缀树构建自适应、非参数化的草案模型；2）设计长度感知的推测策略，对可能较长的轨迹分配更积极的草案预算，从而优化整体解码效率。

Result: 在数学与代码推理任务上实验表明，DAS最多可将rollout时间减少50%，同时保持与原始模型完全相同的训练曲线和输出结果。

Conclusion: DAS通过分布感知的推测解码，在不改变模型输出的前提下显著提升RL后训练的rollout效率，为大规模语言模型的高效对齐提供了一种可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.

Motivation: 现有基于预训练模型的类增量学习方法无法持续调整特征表示，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出AnaCP（Analytic Contrastive Projection），利用对比投影进行特征空间的增量更新，保持解析分类器效率的同时实现无梯度的特征适应。

Result: 实验表明AnaCP优于现有基线方法，并在多个类增量学习任务上达到接近联合训练的准确率。

Conclusion: AnaCP通过非梯度方式实现特征表示的持续优化，在保持高效性的同时显著提升类增量学习性能，为解决灾难性遗忘提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电力系统投资规划依赖有限场景预测，难以捕捉长期不确定性及场景内波动性，限制了决策的鲁棒性。

Result: 在典型电力系统规划案例中验证了该方法的有效性，相比传统场景法具有更好的计算效率和可靠性。

Conclusion: TPMs为电力系统长期投资规划提供了更优的不确定性量化与风险管理框架，支持鲁棒决策。

Abstract: Investment planning in power utilities, such as generation and transmission expansion, requires decade-long forecasts under profound uncertainty. Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.
  This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness through a representative power system planning case study, illustrating computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络方法在差分隐私表格数据生成中存在局限，尤其在处理密集相关数据时，统计模型易被复杂依赖关系压倒，而神经网络更具潜力但未被充分释放。

Method: 提出MargNet，结合统计模型的优点（如自适应边际选择策略），训练神经网络生成符合选定边际分布的数据。

Result: 在稀疏相关数据集上性能接近最优统计方法，并实现平均7倍加速；在密集相关数据集上，相比之前最佳方法 fidelity error 最多降低26%。

Conclusion: MargNet在密集相关数据上实现了新的最先进性能，验证了神经网络在差分隐私数据合成中的潜力。

Abstract: In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\% compared to the previous best. We release our code on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet}

Abstract: Accurate renewable energy forecasting is essential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and enabling grid decarbonization. However, current approaches fail to effectively integrate the rich spatial context of weather patterns with their temporal evolution. This work introduces a novel approach that treats weather maps as tokens in transformer sequences to predict renewable energy. Hourly weather maps are encoded as spatial tokens using a lightweight convolutional neural network, and then processed by a transformer to capture temporal dynamics across a 45-hour forecast horizon. Despite disadvantages in input initialization, evaluation against ENTSO-E operational forecasts shows a reduction in RMSE of about 60\% and 20\% for wind and solar respectively.

Conclusion: 复数加权扩散为提升GNN表达力提供了原理性强且通用的新机制，兼具理论基础与实际有效性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.

TL;DR: 调整随机森林中的自助采样率（BR）可显著提升回归性能，最佳BR值依赖于数据集特征：全局特征-目标关系强时偏好高BR，局部目标方差大时偏好低BR，且BR=1.0并非总是最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机森林默认使用BR=1.0，但其是否最优缺乏系统研究，尤其在不同数据特性下的表现差异未被充分探索。

Method: 在39个异质回归数据集和16种RF配置上，系统评估BR从0.2到5.0对性能的影响，采用重复两折交叉验证和均方误差进行评价，并通过合成数据控制噪声水平以分析偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 仅4个数据集在BR=1.0时最优；24个数据集偏好BR≤1.0，15个偏好BR>1.0；发现数据集特征与最优BR的关联：强全局关系利于高BR，高局部方差利于低BR；合成实验证实低噪环境下高BR降偏，高噪环境下低BR降方差。

Conclusion: BR是影响随机森林回归性能的重要超参数，应根据数据特征进行调优，而非固定为1.0。

Abstract: Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalability of a recent Wasserstein-distance approach for training stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to reconstruct multidimensional random field models. We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the "curse of dimensionality" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models.

Abstract: We study how vision-language-action (VLA) models can improve through real-world deployments via reinforcement learning (RL). We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.

Motivation: 由于输入数据的相关性，稀疏自编码器（SAE）的优化过程面临挑战，本文旨在通过引入白化预处理改善其训练性能与特征可解释性。

Method: 在多种模型结构、宽度和稀度条件下，对ReLU和Top-K SAE应用PCA白化预处理，并结合理论分析、仿真和SAEBench基准测试评估其影响。

Result: 白化使优化景观更接近凸函数，提升了稀疏探针准确率和特征解耦等解释性指标，尽管重构质量略有下降。

Conclusion: 白化应被视为SAE训练的默认预处理步骤，尤其当优先考虑可解释性而非完美重构时。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning interpretable features from neural network activations. However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.

### [228] [Node-Level Uncertainty Estimation in LLM-Generated SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13984)
*Hilaf Hasson,Ruocheng Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于抽象语法树（AST）节点级不确定性的LLM生成SQL错误检测框架，通过语义感知标注和丰富的特征表示显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖序列级别的置信度（如token log-probabilities），难以精确定位SQL生成中的错误，缺乏细粒度和语义层面的诊断能力。

Method: 首先设计语义感知的节点标注算法，避免对结构容器或别名变化过度惩罚；然后提取包含模式信息、词法特征、类型兼容性等的丰富节点特征，训练监督分类器预测每个节点的错误概率，将其解释为校准后的不确定性。

Result: 在多个数据库和数据集上，相比token log-probabilities平均AUC提升27.44%，且跨数据库评估表现稳健；支持精准错误定位、目标修复、人工复核和选择性执行。

Conclusion: 节点级、语义驱动的不确定性估计是比整体序列置信度更优、更可解释的SQL错误检测方案。

Abstract: We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.

### [229] [On the Gradient Complexity of Private Optimization with Private Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13999)
*Michael Menart,Aleksandar Nikolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在差分隐私条件下，针对Lipschitz凸损失的经验/总体风险最小化的首次阶oracle查询次数的运行时间。对于非光滑损失，提出了达到α超额风险所需的最小查询次数下界，并证明这些下界在高维情况下是紧的；对于光滑损失，给出了仅要求优化器为私有的情况下的下界，显示了与非私有情况相比，差分私有优化器需支付维度相关的运行时间代价。此外，还将方法扩展到信息受限的oracle情形，揭示了梯度量化技术在优化中的基本限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解差分隐私对凸优化算法运行时间的影响，尤其是在不同平滑性和信息传输限制下的性能界限。

Method: 通过建立在不同设定（如非光滑与光滑损失、私有代理oracle与信息受限oracle）下的理论下界，并结合已有的DP-SGD等算法进行上界分析，验证所提出下界的紧致性。

Result: 1. 非光滑损失下，达到α超额风险所需oracle查询次数的下界为Ω(min{√d/α², d/log(1/α)})，并在d > ̃Ω(1/α⁴)时证明其紧致性；2. 对于小批量大小算法，下界可加强至Ω(min{d/(m̄α²), d/log(1/α)})；3. 光滑损失下，下界为˜Ω(√d/α + min{1/α², n})，且接近现有算法的性能；4. 在信息受限oracle下，若每次传输不超过Γ比特，则需要Ω(min{d/(α²Γ), d/log(1/α)})次查询。

Conclusion: 差分隐私引入了维度依赖的运行时间开销，且在非光滑和信息受限设置中存在根本性的优化限制，揭示了隐私与效率之间的权衡。

Abstract: We study the running time, in terms of first order oracle queries, of differentially private empirical/population risk minimization of Lipschitz convex losses. We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \geq 1/α^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\tildeΩ(1/α^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $Ω(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)} \})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\tildeΩ\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}α + \min\{\frac{1}{α^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $Γ$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $Ω\big(\min\{\frac{d}{α^2Γ}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\}\big)$ oracle calls are needed. This result shows fundamental limitations of gradient quantization techniques in optimization.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于概率电路的方法有效克服了传统方法的限制，为贝叶斯网络结构学习提供了更高效、精确的边际推理手段。

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BNs) are a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models employed in numerous application domains. However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.

Motivation: 理解当前认证防御机制在面对恶意操纵时的局限性，尤其是认证过程本身可能被攻击者利用的风险。

Method: 提出区域聚焦的对抗样本生成方法，通过精心设计的小扰动使模型不仅误分类，还为对抗样本生成针对目标类别的虚假大认证半径。

Result: 在ImageNet上成功绕过了Densepure等先进认证防御，生成的对抗样本具有不可察觉的扰动，并获得了比原始类别更大的虚假认证半径。

Conclusion: 当前的认证防御仍存在根本性漏洞，需重新审视认证机制的安全性与可靠性。

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究发现，在特定领域进行窄域拒绝学习（refusal unlearning）可能引发跨领域的新兴错位（EMA），即模型在非目标领域也降低拒绝率，产生潜在有害响应。实验表明，网络安全和安全概念的拒绝学习会传播EMA至其他负责任AI领域，其中安全概念的影响更显著。通过在受影响领域使用保留数据结合交叉熵损失可有效恢复对齐。表示层面的概念向量分析显示，早期层中表示相似性高的概念更易受EMA影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解导致模型在拒绝学习后出现跨领域错误行为（即新兴错位，EMA）的原因，尤其是窄域干预如何影响其他无关领域的拒绝行为，以提升大模型在安全与对齐方面的可控性。

Method: 在Mistral-7b-0.3v和Qwen-7b-2.5两个模型上对网络安全和安全概念进行拒绝学习，并评估其在七个负责任AI领域（如偏见、毒性、隐私等）中的拒绝分数变化；引入带交叉熵损失的保留数据训练来缓解EMA；通过概念向量分析表示层中的概念纠缠。

Result: 1. 窄域拒绝学习可引发跨领域EMA，尤其安全概念对偏见等领域影响显著；2. 该现象在两个模型家族中均一致存在；3. 使用少量保留数据加交叉熵损失可有效恢复多数领域的对齐；4. 概念向量分析表明，早期层表示相似性高的概念更易发生EMA。

Conclusion: 拒绝学习虽能提升特定任务上的合规性，但可能导致跨领域的对齐退化（EMA），需谨慎设计干预策略；通过表示分析可识别易受影响的概念组合，并提出有效的缓解方法，为构建更安全的大模型提供指导。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.

TL;DR: SmallML是一个针对中小企业的贝叶斯迁移学习框架，能在仅有50-200个样本的情况下实现高精度预测，通过结合迁移学习、分层贝叶斯建模和共形预测，在客户流失预测中显著优于传统方法，推动AI民主化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中小企业占美国企业的99.9%，但由于数据量小，难以应用现代机器学习技术。现有方法在小样本下表现差，导致AI资源分配不均，亟需一种适用于小规模数据的高效预测框架。

Method: 提出SmallML框架，包含三层结构：第一层利用SHAP方法从22,673条公共记录中提取信息先验，将梯度提升模型的知识迁移到逻辑回归；第二层采用J=5-50个中小企业上的分层贝叶斯模型进行自适应收缩的层次化参数共享；第三层使用共形预测提供具有有限样本覆盖率保证的不确定性量化。

Result: 在每家企业仅100个样本的情况下，AUC达到96.7%±4.2%，比独立逻辑回归提升24.2个百分点（p < 0.000001）；共形预测在90%目标置信水平下实现92%的经验覆盖率；训练在标准CPU上耗时33分钟。

Conclusion: SmallML成功解决了中小企业因数据稀缺而无法有效使用AI的问题，实现了企业级预测性能，为3300万美国中小企业提供了可及的机器学习工具，填补了AI普惠化的重要空白。

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99.9% of U.S. businesses yet remain systematically excluded from AI due to a mismatch between their operational scale and modern machine learning's data requirements. This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations.
  We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification.
  Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware. By enabling enterprise-grade predictions for 33 million U.S. SMEs previously excluded from machine learning, SmallML addresses a critical gap in AI democratization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Radial Compensation (RC)的信息几何方法，用于解耦流形上生成模型中的曲率与参数语义，提升模型稳定性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在流形上建模时，指数映射或保体积映射会将曲率与模型参数纠缠，导致梯度方差增大，高维情况下出现半径膨胀、似然下降和求解器僵化问题。

Method: 引入Radial Compensation (RC)方法，通过在切空间中选择适当的基密度，使似然仅依赖于到极点的测地距离，从而解耦曲率影响；提出bExp映射族，在体积失真与测地误差间取得平衡，并在RC框架下保持密度与Fisher信息不变。

Result: RC方法在图像、图结构、蛋白质等不同数据上的VAE、归一化流等生成模型中表现出更优的测试似然、更稳定的半径学习、更低的梯度方差和计算成本，有效防止高维流中的半径爆炸。

Conclusion: RC-bExp是一种鲁棒的默认选择，适用于基于似然训练的流形生成模型，实现了曲率不变的参数语义与数值优化的分离。

Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.

Abstract: In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上显著优于现有方法，提升药物预测准确性并降低药物-药物相互作用率。

Conclusion: 融合动态因果关系与跨模态协同效应可生成更符合临床需求、个性化的药物推荐。

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations. Our code is released publicly at https://github.com/rkl71/CafeMed.

Result: 实验表明，CFG-EC在低引导强度下表现更优，显著提升提示对齐性和生成性能。

Conclusion: CFG-EC有效缓解了CFG中的噪声估计偏差，提供了更可靠的引导路径，适用于各类基于CFG的方法。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.

Conclusion: Meta-SimGNN有效解决了设备配置变化带来的CSI维度不一致问题，提升了深度学习定位模型在跨场景应用中的实用性和适应性，推动了其在实际WiFi环境中的部署潜力。

Abstract: To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私审计方法需要修改训练数据（如插入异常样本或删除数据），在大规模系统中成本高、工程开销大，缺乏对受保护属性（如标签）隐私的有效评估手段。

Method: 提出一种基于观测的审计框架，利用数据分布本身的随机性进行隐私审计，无需干预训练数据；将审计范围从传统的成员推断扩展到受保护属性（包括标签）。

Result: 在Criteo和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验验证了该方法在标签隐私审计方面的有效性，且无需修改训练流程。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模生产环境提供了更实用、低开销的隐私审计新途径。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.

Conclusion: MoE-SpeQ通过计算换通信的思路，结合推测执行与系统协同设计，有效解决了MoE模型在资源受限环境下的I/O瓶颈问题，为在通用硬件上高效部署大型MoE模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.
  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

### [241] [Soft-Label Training Preserves Epistemic Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14117)
*Agamdeep Singh,Ashish Tiwari,Hosein Hasanbeig,Priyanshu Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出在具有内在主观性的机器学习任务中，应将标注分布本身视为真实标签（软标签训练），而非将其压缩为单一标签。实验证明，软标签训练能更好地保留认知不确定性，显著降低与人类标注的KL散度，并提高模型与标注熵之间的相关性，同时保持与硬标签训练相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将多样化的标注分布简化为单一标签，导致模型在本质上模糊的样本上表现出虚假的高置信度，与人类感知的不确定性不一致。因此，需要一种更符合认知实际的方法来处理主观性数据。

Method: 采用软标签训练方法，直接以标注分布作为监督信号进行模型训练，并在多个视觉和自然语言处理任务中评估其对模型不确定性建模能力的影响。

Result: 软标签训练相比硬标签训练，在KL散度上降低了32%，在模型与标注熵的相关性上提升了61%，同时保持了相当的预测准确率。

Conclusion: 标注分布不应被视为噪声，而应作为认知不确定性的忠实反映，模型应当学习并再现这种分布，从而实现与人类判断更一致的不确定性表达。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) 的方法，用于从观察数据中估计时间到事件结果的反事实风险轨迹，适用于多单位多时期面板数据设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于删失、样本量有限和非随机治疗分配，从观察数据中估计时间到事件结果的因果效应具有挑战性。现实场景中常需回答“何时-如果”问题，即在特定干预下事件发生时间如何变化。

Method: 在具有低秩结构的面板框架下，使用其他单元的观测轨迹的加权组合来估计目标单元的反事实风险轨迹，并为SSC提供识别性和有限样本保证。

Result: 在癌症治疗结果的多国临床数据集中验证了该方法，发现新疗法的可及性与改善的生存率相关，表现为干预后风险轨迹低于合成对照组。

Conclusion: SSC为使用观察数据进行反事实生存推断提供了一个通用且可解释的工具，在医学、经济学和公共政策中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种自动化偏见识别框架，用于检测大语言模型中的社会偏见（如性别、种族、职业和宗教），并通过提示技术和数据增强进行模型优化，显著提升了对隐性偏见的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）从训练数据中继承了显性和隐性偏见，可能导致不公平输出和有害刻板印象的传播，因此亟需有效识别和缓解这些偏见。

Method: 采用两方面方法检测文本中的显性和隐性偏见，使用StereoSet和CrowSPairs等基准评估多个生成模型（如BERT和GPT-3.5），并提出自动化偏见识别框架；结合词袋分析揭示隐性刻板印象，并通过提示工程和数据增强进行模型微调。

Result: 微调后的模型在跨数据集测试中表现出良好的适应性，在隐性偏见基准上的性能提升高达20%，但在性别偏见处理上仍存在困难，且模型常过度依赖关键词。

Conclusion: 尽管当前大语言模型在缓解偏见方面取得一定进展，但仍存在局限性；结合提示技术和数据增强的微调策略能有效提升对隐性偏见的识别与抑制能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图遗忘方法忽视了符号图的独特异质性，在应用于符号图神经网络时会丢失关键的符号信息，导致模型效用和遗忘效果下降。

Method: CSGU采用三阶段方法：1）通过三角结构高效识别最小受影响邻域；2）应用社会学理论量化节点重要性以优化隐私预算分配；3）执行重要性加权参数更新，实现可认证的修改并最小化效用损失。

Result: 实验表明，CSGU在效用保持和遗忘有效性方面均优于现有方法，特别是在SGNN上表现突出。

Conclusion: CSGU有效解决了符号图中图遗忘的挑战，兼顾了隐私保护、模型效用与社会学原理的保留。

Abstract: Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.

Motivation: 主流的红队测试方法依赖在线生成和黑箱输出分析，成本高且反馈延迟，难以支持模型训练后的快速安全诊断。

Method: 提出N-GLARE，基于模型的潜在表示进行安全评估，利用APT（角度-概率轨迹）分析潜层动态，并引入JSS（Jensen-Shannon可分性）度量来量化安全性。

Result: 在40多个模型和20种红队策略上验证，JSS度量与红队测试得出的安全排名高度一致，且成本低于1%的token和运行时间开销。

Conclusion: N-GLARE提供了一种高效的无输出评估代理方案，适用于大语言模型的安全性实时诊断。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety robustness of LLMs is critical for their deployment. However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天气预报因大气的混沌特性而面临挑战，传统集合预报方法计算成本高，而现有的贝叶斯深度学习方法缺乏与物理机制的有效结合，因此需要一种统一且高效的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 提出一个统一的混合贝叶斯深度学习框架，通过变分推断学习认知不确定性，并引入物理信息引导的随机扰动方案建模流依赖的大气动力学以捕捉随机不确定性，同时建立了连接贝叶斯深度学习与集合预报的理论框架。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合贝叶斯深度学习框架有效融合了数据驱动与物理机制，为天气预报中的不确定性建模提供了理论与实践上的新路径，兼具高性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TSMCTS算法，通过减少方差和缓解路径退化问题，改进了Sequential Monte Carlo在强化学习中的应用，使其在离散和连续环境中均优于SMC和现代MCTS版本，同时保持良好的并行化特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SMC存在较大方差和路径退化问题，难以随搜索深度增加而良好扩展，因此需要一种更高效的基于SMC的搜索方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为TSMCTS（Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search）的新算法，通过两次序贯蒙特卡洛过程实现方差降低和路径退化缓解，并结合树搜索结构提升性能。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中的实验表明，TSMCTS优于SMC基线和一种流行的现代MCTS变体，且能更好地随顺序计算资源增加而扩展。

Conclusion: TSMCTS有效解决了SMC在深度搜索中的扩展性问题，在保持GPU并行优势的同时提升了搜索效率和性能，是模型基础强化学习中搜索算法的一个有前景的改进方向。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage search are responsible for many milestone breakthroughs in RL. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态空间绑定方法通常复杂且耗时，需要大量计算资源。作者希望通过简化架构并强调高质量数据的作用，实现高效、可复现且易于训练的多模态对齐。

Method: 提出EBind方法，使用单一编码器处理每种模态，并依赖高质量、多样化的多源数据（包括自动化获取的五元组、人工标注的三元组和现有带描述的数据）进行对比学习训练。

Result: 在13项评估中验证了各数据源的有效性；提出的1.8B参数模型在多个任务上超越更大模型；构建了首个高质量、共识标注的音频与点云之间的零样本分类基准。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的数据组合和简化的架构，EBind实现了高效、高性能的多模态空间对齐，推动了多模态学习的可及性和可复现性。

Abstract: We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs. In contrast to related work, we will open-source our code, model weights, and datasets.

Conclusion: 对象中心化表征与因果感知机制的结合能有效提升复杂环境下的世界模型精度与强化学习性能。

Abstract: World models have been developed to support sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning agents. However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.

Abstract: Recent work in deep learning has opened new possibilities for solving classical algorithmic tasks using end-to-end learned models. In this work, we investigate the fundamental task of solving linear systems, particularly those that are ill-conditioned. Existing numerical methods for ill-conditioned systems often require careful parameter tuning, preconditioning, or domain-specific expertise to ensure accuracy and stability. In this work, we propose Algebraformer, a Transformer-based architecture that learns to solve linear systems end-to-end, even in the presence of severe ill-conditioning. Our model leverages a novel encoding scheme that enables efficient representation of matrix and vector inputs, with a memory complexity of $O(n^2)$, supporting scalable inference. We demonstrate its effectiveness on application-driven linear problems, including interpolation tasks from spectral methods for boundary value problems and acceleration of the Newton method. Algebraformer achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower computational overhead at test time, demonstrating that general-purpose neural architectures can effectively reduce complexity in traditional scientific computing pipelines.

Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

Abstract: Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models (TabPFN and TabICL) alongside with classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior performance while being up to three orders of magnitude faster than tabular foundation models.

Conclusion: 参数方差与剪枝鲁棒性密切相关，VAR是一种简单、高效且理论可解释的训练策略，有助于训练更易于压缩的模型。

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.

Abstract: Phonocardiogram (PCG) analysis is vital for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the scarcity of labeled pathological data hinders the capability of AI systems. To bridge this, we introduce H-LDM, a Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Model for generating clinically accurate and controllable PCG signals from structured metadata. Our approach features: (1) a multi-scale VAE that learns a physiologically-disentangled latent space, separating rhythm, heart sounds, and murmurs; (2) a hierarchical text-to-biosignal pipeline that leverages rich clinical metadata for fine-grained control over 17 distinct conditions; and (3) an interpretable diffusion process guided by a novel Medical Attention module. Experiments on the PhysioNet CirCor dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Fréchet Audio Distance of 9.7, a 92% attribute disentanglement score, and 87.1% clinical validity confirmed by cardiologists. Augmenting diagnostic models with our synthetic data improves the accuracy of rare disease classification by 11.3\%. H-LDM establishes a new direction for data augmentation in cardiac diagnostics, bridging data scarcity with interpretable clinical insights.

*Yuwen Zhang,Viet Tran,Paul Weng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了干预效率（IE）和扰动验证框架（PVF）两种工具，以应对临床机器学习中因Rashomon效应导致的模型选择不确定性，提升模型在资源受限和数据扰动下的鲁棒性与实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床机器学习中，由于数据小、不平衡、噪声多以及特征高维弱识别，存在多个性能相近的模型（Rashomon效应），传统评估方法不可靠，且未考虑资源限制和操作优先级，导致模型选择困难。

Method: 提出干预效率（IE）作为容量感知指标，衡量模型在有限干预下识别可行动真阳性的效率；设计扰动验证框架（PVF），通过在扰动数据上评估模型性能稳定性来筛选鲁棒模型。

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据集上的实验表明，IE和PVF能有效支持在资源约束下选择更具泛化能力和稳定性的模型，优于传统F1等指标。

Conclusion: IE和PVF为应对临床机器学习中的Rashomon效应提供了新的评估范式，使模型选择更贴近实际临床需求和部署可靠性。

Abstract: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有的机器学习方法在处理多个需求（如公平性、边界条件）时，依赖权重调参，效率低下，尤其在涉及等式或对等性约束时缺乏有效的泛化保证。

Conclusion: 该方法为包含等式约束的复杂机器学习问题提供了理论支持和实用求解方案，避免了传统加权方法的调参难题。

Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效保证学习解符合不可逆物理过程的方向性，仅需对现有PINN做最小修改，具有广泛适用性和重要应用前景。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.

Method: 通过实验分析不同LoRA秩下后门攻击的生命周期，评估其在联邦学习环境中的持久性，并探讨现有评估方法的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，在最优注入条件下，LoRA秩越低，后门在攻击后的持续时间越长。同时揭示了当前后门攻击评估中存在的问题。

Conclusion: LoRA的结构特性会影响后门攻击的持久性，较低秩增强了后门的稳定性；研究强调了改进评估方法的重要性，以提升联邦学习系统安全评估的鲁棒性和公平性。

Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.

Motivation: 现有跨模态检索的通用到定制化方法通常假设目标域数据完全可用，但在实际中查询以在线且多样化的方式出现，导致查询偏移问题，破坏模型的公共空间并遗忘通用知识。

Method: 提出REST方法：1）通过 refine 检索结果生成查询预测，并设计QS鲁棒目标函数以在线保持公共空间；2）引入梯度解耦模块，在适应过程中分离梯度，防止遗忘通用知识。

Result: 在三个跨模态检索任务的20个基准上实验表明，REST在应对查询偏移方面显著优于现有方法，有效保持了模型性能与稳定性。

Conclusion: REST能够实现对查询偏移的鲁棒、在线和协调适应，解决了现实场景中跨模态检索的分布外查询挑战，提升了模型的泛化能力与实用性。

Abstract: Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高通量成像平台如ComplexEye产生大量数据，给存储和传输带来巨大负担，亟需高效的图像压缩方法。

Method: FlowRoI通过估计连续帧之间的光流生成可靠覆盖迁移细胞的感兴趣区域（RoI）掩码，并结合JPEG2000对原始图像和RoI掩码进行联合编码，实现RoI感知的压缩。

Result: FlowRoI在现代笔记本电脑上平均处理速度达每秒30帧，与标准JPEG2000相当；在相同峰值信噪比下，细胞区域的PSNR更高，压缩率提高2.0-2.2倍。

Conclusion: FlowRoI兼具高效性与高质量压缩能力，适用于高通量活细胞视频分析，具有推动临床转化应用的潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD)的新方法，通过引入“mirage infusion”技术，使扩散模型在生成晶体结构时能够动态改变原子数量，从而提升生成材料的稳定性、独特性和新颖性（S.U.N.）表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在生成晶体材料时无法改变原子数目，限制了生成过程的多样性与灵活性，因此需要一种能突破该限制的方法。

Method: 提出mirage infusion技术，使模型可在生成过程中将原子状态在存在与不存在之间转换，实现原子数目的动态调整；MiAD是一个等变性联合扩散模型，用于从头生成晶体结构。

Result: MiAD在MP-20数据集上实现了8.2%的S.U.N.率，性能比未改进的模型最高提升2.5倍，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: mirage infusion有效提升了扩散模型在晶体生成中的灵活性和生成质量，MiAD为设计新型晶体材料提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于关键心脏生物标志物（如每搏输出量和心输出量）通常需要有创测量，且标注的PPG数据稀缺，因此亟需一种非侵入、准确的监测方法。

Method: 该方法结合了在配对PPG-APW数据上训练的条件变分自编码器与在标记模拟APW段上训练的心脏生物标志物条件密度估计器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效检测心输出量和每搏输出量的波动，并在监测这些生物标志物的时间变化方面优于监督基线模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的混合方法为从PPG信号中非侵入式估计心血管生物标志物提供了可行且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

TL;DR: 提出条件前推神经网络（CPFN），用于条件分布估计，通过学习随机映射实现高效采样和蒙特卡洛估计，无需可逆性或对抗训练，具有轻量、易训练且性能优越的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接建模条件密度存在挑战，需要一种无需复杂训练机制（如对抗训练）且能高效进行条件采样的灵活方法。

Method: CPFN学习一个随机映射φ(x,u)，使得φ(x,U)与Y|X=x近似同分布，U为预定义的潜变量随机向量；通过KL散度导出的目标函数进行训练。

Result: 理论证明了近渐近一致性，实验显示CPFN在多种基准上性能优于或媲美现有最先进方法（如核估计、树模型和深度学习方法），同时保持轻量和易训练。

Conclusion: CPFN是一种有效、简洁且高性能的条件分布估计框架，适用于高效条件采样和统计推断。

Abstract: We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在一致性与模型保真度之间存在权衡：自定义实现虽接口统一但需手动适配且引入数值偏差，而直接使用HuggingFace虽准确但缺乏标准化。需要一个既保持模型原生行为又提供统一接口的解决方案。

Method: 构建nnterp，作为NNsight的轻量级封装，通过自动模块重命名和全面的验证测试，提供跨多种Transformer架构的统一分析接口，并集成常用可解释性方法（如logit lens、patchscope、激活 steering）及注意力概率访问功能。

Result: nnterp支持超过50个来自16种架构家族的模型变体，允许研究人员编写一次干预代码即可广泛部署；库中包含内置验证测试，确保与自定义模型的兼容性。

Conclusion: nnterp成功弥合了机械性可解释性工具在正确性与可用性之间的差距，兼顾了模型保真度与接口标准化，提升了跨架构研究的效率与可靠性。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.

Conclusion: PAFM有效提升了扰动环境下时间序列生成的稳定性和结构一致性，为复杂动态系统的建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Conclusion: 算法-系统协同设计对现代GPU平台上内存受限的大模型推理至关重要。

Abstract: The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.

Motivation: 现有扩散和流匹配模型在肽结合剂设计中存在两个主要问题：离散残基类型的分类采样导致连续参数退化为onehot编码，破坏更新动态；且假设侧链二面角为单模态分布，不符合其真实的多模态特性。因此需要一种能统一处理连续与离散变量并准确建模多模态构象的方法。

Method: 提出PepBFN，将离散残基类型表示为其连续参数分布，实现与其他连续结构参数（如原子位置）的联合贝叶斯更新；采用基于高斯混合的贝叶斯流建模多模态侧链转子状态，并使用基于Matrix Fisher的黎曼流在SO(3)流形上直接建模残基取向。

Result: 实验表明，PepBFN在侧链堆积、逆折叠和结合剂设计任务中均表现出优异性能，能够生成更平滑、连贯的肽结构，显著提升生成质量与预测准确性。

Conclusion: PepBFN通过在全连续空间中进行贝叶斯建模，有效解决了离散-连续不匹配和侧链多模态建模问题，为计算肽设计提供了一种更强大且统一的生成框架。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.

*Youran Zhou,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合确定性扩散框架，用于解决混合类型表格数据中的缺失值填补问题，通过分离连续和离散特征的生成通道，在多种缺失机制下实现了更高的准确性与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的填补模型通常假设特征空间是同质的，难以有效处理包含数值型、类别型和离散型变量的异构表格数据，导致类别变量信息坍塌或数值变量更新不稳定。

Method: 将异构特征分为两个生成通道：基于连续DDIM的通道用于数值变量的确定性去噪，基于离散潜路径扩散的通道用于类别和离散变量建模；两通道在统一的条件填补目标下联合训练。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上实验表明，该方法在MCAR、MAR和MNAR三种缺失机制下，相比现有扩散模型和传统方法具有更高的填补精度、更稳定的采样轨迹和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 针对混合类型表格数据，结构感知的扩散过程（特别是分离建模连续与离散特征）对提升深度学习填补性能至关重要。

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.
  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.
  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的降维投影质量度量指标——Warping Index（WI），通过关注点间空区域的保持来评估二维可视化中的视觉失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的投影质量度量主要关注数据全局或局部结构的保留，忽略了可能导致误判的视觉失真（如异常值或伪影）。需要一种更注重视觉保真度的质量度量。

Method: 提出了Warping Index（WI），基于降维后点之间空区域的变形程度来量化投影质量，强调空区域的正确保留对 faithful 可视化的重要性。

Result: WI能够有效捕捉现有指标忽略的视觉失真，如异常值和伪影，在评估二维降维投影的视觉保真度方面表现出优势。

Conclusion: Warping Index为评估降维可视化质量提供了一个新的视角，特别适用于关注视觉准确性的场景，有助于避免因投影失真导致的错误解读。

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.

Method: 提出ReflexGrad架构，整合LLM驱动的分层任务分解、历史感知的因果反思和基于梯度的优化，实现零样本决策。

Result: 在ALFWorld基准上，ReflexGrad在首次尝试时达到67%的零样本成功率，并展现出稳定的收敛性和跨任务迁移能力（提升67%至78%）。

Conclusion: 多机制协同整合能有效支持无需示范或微调的零样本通用决策，其性能接近已有少样本基线方法。

Abstract: Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

Method: 提出Fuzzy MAP EM算法，通过将专家定义的模糊模型生成的模糊伪计数融入期望最大化（EM）框架，将参数估计问题转化为最大后验（MAP）估计。

Result: 在合成医疗模拟中，该方法在低数据量和高噪声条件下均优于标准EM算法；在重症肌无力案例中成功恢复出符合临床逻辑的POMDP模型。

Conclusion: Fuzzy MAP EM算法能有效利用专家知识提升小样本下的POMDP参数学习效果，具有在医疗等领域实现数据高效建模的应用潜力。

Abstract: Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在科学创意生成与选择中按目标概率分布进行探索的能力，揭示当前AI训练方式在需要概率性探索任务中的局限性。

Method: 通过系统性实验，要求多个现代大语言模型按照简单的概率分布生成输出，并分析其实际生成行为与目标分布的偏差。

Result: 所有测试的现代大语言模型均严重偏离目标概率分布，例如要求以49%概率输出“1”时，模型几乎100%输出“0”。这种行为压倒了模型本身可能存在的强先验偏差。

Conclusion: 当前的大语言模型在需要概率性探索的任务中存在根本性缺陷，强化学习训练方式抑制了模型的多样化探索能力。

Abstract: Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of "1" 49% of the time produces an answer of "0" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.

Motivation: 传统多变量时间序列预测方法在建模变量间复杂依赖关系时存在局限性，通道独立方法忽略跨通道信息，通道依赖方法易引入噪声和过拟合。

Method: 提出Adapformer模型，采用双阶段编码器-解码器结构，包含自适应通道增强器（ACE）和自适应通道预测器（ACF），分别用于增强表征和优化预测过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Adapformer在预测精度和计算效率方面均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Adapformer通过有效的通道管理机制，在多变量时间序列预测任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

Motivation: 当前医学筛查方法常错过吸烟相关健康问题的早期预警信号，导致晚期诊断。因此，需要更有效的工具来早期识别高风险个体，以改善干预时机和临床结局。

Method: 采用横断面设计，分析55,691名个体的健康体检数据，包括体测指标、血液检测和人口学信息。使用随机森林、XGBoost和LightGBM三种算法构建吸烟状态分类模型，并利用SHAP方法进行特征重要性解释。

Result: 随机森林模型在区分当前吸烟者方面表现最优，AUC达到0.926。SHAP分析显示血压、甘油三酯、肝酶水平和血清肌酐是预测吸烟相关健康风险的关键生物标志物。

Conclusion: 基于常规体检数据的机器学习模型（尤其是随机森林）能有效识别吸烟相关的健康风险，具备良好的临床可解释性和实际部署潜力，有助于实现早期干预。

Abstract: Smoking continues to be a major preventable cause of death worldwide, affecting millions through damage to the heart, metabolism, liver, and kidneys. However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.

*Fu-Ming Guo,Yingfang Fan*

TL;DR: 提出AdamHuberDecay，一种替代AdamW的自适应优化器，使用解耦的平滑Huber正则化取代ℓ2惩罚，提升训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AdamW中的ℓ2惩罚对所有参数施加相同强度的衰减，易受极端梯度方向影响且过度惩罚良好条件的坐标，缺乏稀疏性和鲁棒性。

Method: 将AdamW中的ℓ2正则替换为解耦的平滑Huber正则化，在参数幅度小于阈值δ时进行二次衰减，超过δ时转为线性衰减，并推导出闭式解以O(1)额外成本集成到任意Adam类优化器中。

Result: 在GPT-2和GPT-3预训练中，AdamHuberDecay相比AdamW收敛快10-15%，降低验证困惑度达4点，下游任务性能提升2.5-4.7%，权重直方图更稀疏，剪枝后节省20-30%内存，且无需额外调参。

Conclusion: AdamHuberDecay提供了一种简单而有原则的方法，显著提升生成式Transformer模型训练的效率、鲁棒性和稀疏性。

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $δ$, and linearly ($\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $δ$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights.
  We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers.

Result: 实验结果表明，基于LAUD的大语言模型在商品名称分类任务上优于纯零样本或少样本学习方法。

Conclusion: LAUD有效缓解了标注数据稀缺下的冷启动问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generalize beyond their pre-training data, and fine-tuning LLMs can elevate performance to human-level and beyond. However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, inefficient, and driven by trial and error. To alleviate this issue of lacking labeled data, we present a learning framework integrating LLMs with active learning for unlabeled dataset (LAUD). LAUD mitigates the cold-start problem by constructing an initial label set with zero-shot learning. Experimental results show that LLMs derived from LAUD outperform LLMs with zero-shot or few-shot learning on commodity name classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LAUD.

Conclusion: 采用GP框架的评分聚合方法优于传统均值法，建议在线声誉系统采用更智能、自适应的聚合方式以更好反映用户满意度。

Abstract: Online ratings influence customer decision-making, yet standard aggregation methods, such as the sample mean, fail to adapt to quality changes over time and ignore review heterogeneity (e.g., review sentiment, a review's helpfulness). To address these challenges, we demonstrate the value of using the Gaussian process (GP) framework for rating aggregation. Specifically, we present a tailored GP model that captures the dynamics of ratings over time while additionally accounting for review heterogeneity. Based on 121,123 ratings from Yelp, we compare the predictive power of different rating aggregation methods in predicting future ratings, thereby finding that the GP model is considerably more accurate and reduces the mean absolute error by 10.2% compared to the sample mean. Our findings have important implications for marketing practitioners and customers. By moving beyond means, designers of online reputation systems can display more informative and adaptive aggregated rating scores that are accurate signals of expected customer satisfaction.

Conclusion: 目前尚不清楚过去十年在毒性预测上是否取得了实质性进展，强调需使用原始数据和标准化评估来衡量进步。

Abstract: Deep learning's rise since the early 2010s has transformed fields like computer vision and natural language processing and strongly influenced biomedical research. For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's "ImageNet moment" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.

TL;DR: 本文研究了学习平台上用户的战略行为，提出了前瞻推理框架下的level-k思维和集体推理模型，分析了个体与集体行为对预测结果的影响，并揭示了学习者与用户效用之间对齐的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习平台的优化标准往往反映设计者而非用户自身的偏好，导致用户可能采取战略行为来影响预测结果。以往研究多关注模型部署后用户的策略反应，而忽略了用户间行为的相互影响。因此，需要一个考虑用户行为耦合效应的理论框架。

Method: 引入行为经济学中的level-k思维模型，刻画用户在前瞻推理下的逐层推理过程；提出集体推理模型，分析用户通过协调行动共同影响模型的学习动态；对比自私行为与协调行为下的均衡结果，引入效用对齐概念以衡量平台与用户目标的一致性。

Result: 发现level-k思维虽能加速收敛至均衡，但最终均衡状态不变，高层次推理在长期中无额外收益；集体推理可改变均衡结果，提升整体效用，但其有效性依赖于用户间效用与学习者目标的对齐程度。

Conclusion: 用户的前瞻性和协调行为显著影响学习系统的演化路径，效用对齐是实现平台与用户共赢的关键，为设计更公平、稳健的学习系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SparseST，一种通过利用数据稀疏性来提高时空模型效率的新框架，并设计多目标损失函数在模型性能和计算效率之间进行权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ConvLSTM及其变体在时空数据挖掘中表现优异但计算成本高，难以应用于资源受限的边缘设备；现有高效AI方法因时空数据依赖复杂而难以压缩模型容量，数据与特征冗余问题被忽视。

Method: 提出SparseST框架，利用数据和特征中的冗余性引入稀疏性以降低计算开销，并设计多目标复合损失函数逼近性能与效率的Pareto前沿。

Result: SparseST在保持模型性能的同时显著降低了计算成本，实现了在不同资源约束下的灵活调整。

Conclusion: 通过挖掘数据稀疏性而非压缩模型，SparseST为边缘计算场景下的高效时空数据挖掘提供了有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.

### [283] [Imagine in Space: Exploring the Frontier of Spatial Intelligence and Reasoning Efficiency in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13782)
*Xiaoxing Lian,Aidong Yang,Jun Zhu,Peng Wang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了SpatiaLite，一个用于评估视觉语言模型（VLM）空间推理能力的合成基准，并发现当前先进VLM在依赖语言表征进行空间推理时存在缺陷和低效问题，进而提出一种基于意象驱动的框架（IDF）以提升其空间建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在多种推理任务中表现出色，但在空间推理（如心理旋转、导航等）方面仍表现不佳。作者假设‘想象’是空间世界模型中的核心机制，旨在探究现有VLM的空间推理机制及其局限性。

Method: 构建了一个名为SpatiaLite的全合成基准，用于联合评估空间推理准确性和推理效率；通过控制变量实验分析VLM的推理路径与token使用情况；提出意象驱动框架（IDF），通过数据合成与训练隐式构建内部世界模型。

Result: 实验发现：1）当前VLM主要依赖语言表征进行空间推理，在需要感知空间关系和3D几何变换的任务上表现差；2）其推理过程效率低下，复杂度增加时token消耗迅速上升；3）IDF能有效促进VLM建立内部空间世界模型，提升推理性能。

Conclusion: 当前先进VLM在空间推理方面存在根本性短板，主要源于缺乏基于想象的内部空间模拟机制；SpatiaLite为评估和改进VLM的空间能力提供了有效工具，而IDF为未来构建具备空间认知能力的AI系统指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

Motivation: 为提升科学与工程工作流中的自动化、透明性和可复现性，开发一个可适应不同研究领域的AI辅助系统。

Method: 采用Router-Planner-Coordinator架构与可选Evaluator角色，通过LangGraph进行编排，使用FAISS和SQLite实现混合记忆机制，并通过配置驱动的方式支持自定义工具、提示和数据源。

Result: 系统实现了结构化输出、语义检索、增量索引和推理过程可视化，在废物转化、能源安全等多个科研领域成功应用，展现出跨领域适用性。

Conclusion: AISAC提供了一个透明、可追踪且灵活的AI科学助手框架，支持科研团队无需修改代码即可定制化部署。

Abstract: AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.
  The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.
  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测模型难以捕捉微生物燃料电池（MFC）阳极结构复杂的几何依赖关系，限制了性能优化。

Method: 提出KANGURA：采用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络进行表示学习，将预测建模为函数分解问题；通过几何解耦表示学习分离结构变化，并引入统一注意力机制增强关键区域。

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上达到92.7%准确率，优于15种SOTA模型；在真实MFC阳极结构预测中达到97%准确率。

Conclusion: KANGURA是一种强大的三维几何建模范式，可有效优化复杂结构，适用于先进制造和质量导向的工程应用。

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于均场动力学和随机效用模型的生成模型，用于分析互连大语言模型（LLM）网络在协作问答中的表现，特别是幻觉传播问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在缺乏直接证据时容易产生幻觉，且在相互作用的网络中这种幻觉会扩散，影响原本准确的模型，因此需要研究其传播机制并加以控制。

Method: 结合网络科学中的均场动力学与经济学中的随机效用模型，构建一个包含潜在真实状态的LLM生成模型，并分析有向网络中信息扩散的动力学行为。

Result: 提出了LLM网络中固定点存在且唯一的充分条件，并分析了个体LLM激励（如推理时计算资源）对固定点行为的影响；通过100个开源LLM在多个半合成数据集上的实验，研究了数据异质性、节点能力、网络结构和表述敏感性等因素的影响。

Conclusion: 该模型有助于理解和抑制LLM网络中的幻觉传播，为设计更可靠的协作式问答系统提供了理论基础和实证支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

*Humza Nusrat,Omar Nusrat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KOSMOS，一个自主的AI科学家，在辐射生物学的三个问题上进行了评估，结果显示其生成的一个发现得到充分支持，一个结果合理但不确定，另一个假设错误，表明AI科学家需要严格的审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估自主AI科学家KOSMOS在真实生物医学问题中的假设生成能力，并检验其发现的可靠性。

Method: 使用简单随机基因零模型作为基准，在三个辐射生物学问题上评估KOSMOS生成的假设，采用Spearman相关性、经验p值和一致性指数等统计方法进行分析。

Result: DDR-p53假设未被支持（rho = -0.40, p = 0.76）；OGT/CDO1中CDO1表现出显著关联（r = 0.70, p = 0.0039），OGT无显著关联；12基因签名有预测价值（C-index = 0.61, p = 0.017），但效应不唯一。

Conclusion: KOSMOS生成了一个可靠发现、一个可能但不确定的结果和一个错误假设，说明AI科学家能产生有用想法，但必须通过适当的零模型进行严格验证。

Abstract: Agentic AI "scientists" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.

Motivation: 由于现有方法仅适用于马尔可夫SCM，无法处理包含混杂变量的更一般情况，因此需要将其扩展到半马尔可夫SCM。

Conclusion: 成功地探讨了将分治算法推广至含混杂的SCM的可行性，提出了可行策略并指出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

Result: 在InsightBench上的实验表明，DataSage在所有难度级别上均优于现有的数据洞察智能体。

Conclusion: DataSage为自动化数据洞察发现提供了一个更有效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

### [291] [CORGI: Efficient Pattern Matching With Quadratic Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13942)
*Daniel Weitekamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模式匹配算法CORGI，用于解决规则系统在实时应用中因组合爆炸导致的指数级时间和空间消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于规则的系统在处理大量未约束变量或产生组合性中间部分匹配时，可能出现指数级的时间和空间需求，尤其是在在线AI系统自动生成规则的情况下，容易引发性能瓶颈甚至内存溢出。

Method: 提出CORGI（Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration）算法，采用前向构建并维护一个 grounded 关系图，再通过反向遍历该图按需生成匹配结果，避免存储完整的冲突集；与RETE不同，CORGI不使用β-内存来保存部分匹配。

Result: CORGI在时间和空间上具有二次方的保证，能够流式迭代输出后续匹配结果而不占用大量内存，并在组合匹配任务上显著优于SOAR和OPS5中的RETE实现。

Conclusion: CORGI为实时AI系统和数据库查询等低延迟场景提供了一种更可靠、可预测且高效的替代方案，避免了传统RETE算法在复杂匹配中的高延迟和内存溢出问题。

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

Motivation: 由于真实事故场景数据难以获取，缺乏用于训练视觉模型的高质量危险图像数据集，因此需要合成逼真的危险场景图像以提升 workplace safety 检测模型的性能。

Method: 使用GPT-4o从OSHA事故报告中提取结构化风险信息并转化为对象级场景图，指导文本到图像扩散模型生成符合实际空间和上下文关系的危险场景图像。

Result: 生成的图像在视觉上逼真且语义准确；提出的VQA Graph Score在评估生成图像质量方面优于CLIP和BLIP等现有指标，具有更高的判别灵敏度。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成基于真实事故数据的高质量危险场景图像，为训练安全检测模型提供了可行的数据增强方案，同时VQA评估框架更适用于衡量危险场景生成的真实性与语义一致性。

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrative review and experimental validation of artificial intelligence (AI) agents applied to music analysis and education. We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.
  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.
  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.

Motivation: 由于大语言模型中的知识是静态的，难以适应动态变化的信息，现有知识编辑方法在可扩展性和检索效率方面存在不足，尤其在处理需要多步推理的复杂问题时表现不佳。

Method: 提出ALEX框架，包含分层记忆架构（将知识更新组织为语义簇）、推理查询合成模块（IQS）以缩小查询与事实间的语义差距，以及动态证据裁决引擎（DEA）实现高效的两阶段检索。

Result: 在MQUAKE基准上的实验表明，ALEX将多跳答案准确率（MultiHop-ACC）和推理路径可靠性（HopWise-ACC）显著提升，并将搜索空间减少了80%以上。

Conclusion: ALEX通过降低检索复杂度并提高编辑效率，为构建可扩展、高效且准确的知识编辑系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

Conclusion: 合成数据具备支持高绩效AI模型在严重和危急医疗场景下开发的潜力，Syn-STARTS为稀缺真实数据条件下的研究提供了可行的数据生成方案。

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PRISM，一种无需训练的框架，用于金融信息检索，结合了改进的系统提示、上下文学习和轻量级多智能体系统，在FinAgentBench数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，从长篇金融文件中提取任务相关的信息对决策至关重要，但现有方法在实际应用中存在局限性。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，整合改进的系统提示、上下文学习（ICL）和轻量级多智能体系统，通过模块化设计实现高效的文档和片段排序。

Result: 在FinAgentBench的受限验证集上达到0.71818的NDCG@5得分，验证了其在生产规模金融检索中的可行性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRISM是一种实用、无需训练且可扩展的金融信息检索方案，适用于现实场景，代码已开源。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.

### [297] [Making Evidence Actionable in Adaptive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14052)
*Amirreza Mehrabi,Jason W. Morphew,Breejha Quezada,N. Sanjay Rebello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种教师主导的反馈机制，通过概念级评估生成经过验证的微干预措施，结合三种保障机制（充分性、注意力限制和多样性），以解决自适应学习中干预不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应学习系统虽然能准确诊断学习问题，但干预往往不及时或不匹配，导致教学效果不佳。因此需要一个更精准、可控且高效的干预机制。

Method: 将干预分配形式化为带约束的二元整数规划问题，包含覆盖、时间、能力估计决定的难度窗口、先决条件矩阵及去冗余多样性约束；采用贪心算法、梯度松弛法及混合方法求解，并引入松弛变量定位内容缺口。

Result: 在模拟和涵盖1204名学生的物理课程实践中，两种求解器均实现了接近全覆盖的技能掌握，且在限定观看时间内完成；梯度法比贪心法减少约12%的冗余覆盖并平衡难度，贪心法则在资源稀缺时计算成本更低；松弛变量有助于发现内容缺失并指导资源补充。

Conclusion: 该框架成功闭合了诊断与教学之间的闭环，提供可审计、可扩展、兼顾公平性和学习负荷的个性化教学控制方案，适用于大规模课堂教学。

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

*Yu Liu,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Yangxi Li,Shi Wang,Yanan Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PathMind框架，通过“检索-优先级排序-推理”范式提升知识图谱推理的准确性和可解释性，利用语义感知的路径优先函数选择重要推理路径，并采用双阶段训练策略减少噪声和LLM调用开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的知识图谱推理方法存在两个问题：一是不加区分地提取推理路径，引入无关噪声；二是频繁调用LLM导致高检索开销。因此需要一种能选择关键路径并降低计算成本的方法。

Method: PathMind遵循“Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason”范式：首先从知识图谱中检索查询子图；然后设计语义感知的路径优先函数，综合考虑累积成本和预估未来成本，对推理路径进行优先级排序；最后通过任务特定指令微调和路径级偏好对齐的双阶段训练生成准确且逻辑一致的结果。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，PathMind在复杂推理任务上优于现有方法，尤其在输入token更少的情况下仍能保持高性能，验证了其有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: PathMind通过有选择性地引导大语言模型关注重要推理路径，提升了知识图谱推理的忠实性和可解释性，同时降低了推理开销，为高效KGR提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的多智能体框架APD-agents，用于自动化移动应用页面布局设计，显著提升设计效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用页面布局设计耗时且需要高度专业技能，现有工具学习成本高，团队协作中难以保持风格统一。

Method: 构建了一个由OrchestratorAgent、SemanticParserAgent、PrimaryLayoutAgent、TemplateRetrievalAgent和RecursiveComponentAgent组成的多智能体系统，通过自然语言描述驱动自动生成和优化页面布局。

Result: 在RICO数据集上的实验表明，APD-agents在布局生成质量上达到了当前最优性能。

Conclusion: APD-agents有效实现了移动端页面的自动化布局设计，利用大模型多智能体协同机制降低了设计门槛并提升了设计效率与一致性。

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的视觉-语言导航方法在空间理解上存在不足，且计算开销大、推理延迟高，难以达到专家水平的导航性能。

Method: 设计了包含Runner、Ruminator和Regulator三个模块的R3框架：Runner为轻量级Transformer模型，负责常规导航；Ruminator利用多模态大语言模型进行链式思维推理；Regulator根据三种准则动态切换两者的工作模式。

Result: 在REVERIE基准上，R3比现有最先进方法分别提升了3.28%和3.30%的SPL与RGSPL指标，表现出优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: R3通过融合通用推理与领域专长，在零样本条件下有效解决了LLM在视觉-语言导航中的精度与效率问题，具有较强的实用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

*Sushant Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLEAR框架，一个面向企业部署的全面评估AI代理的体系，强调成本、延迟、有效性、保障和可靠性，而不仅仅是准确性。研究发现，仅优化准确性的方法会导致成本显著增加，而CLEAR能更准确预测生产环境中的成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI代理基准测试主要关注任务完成的准确性，忽视了企业在成本效率、可靠性和操作稳定性方面的需求，导致评估结果无法反映真实生产环境下的表现。

Method: 通过对12个主流基准进行系统分析，并对最先进的代理进行实证评估，识别出当前评估体系的三大缺陷；进而提出CLEAR框架，并在300个企业任务上评估六个领先代理的表现，同时结合专家评估（N=15）验证框架的有效性。

Result: 实验显示，仅优化准确性的代理比成本感知的替代方案昂贵4.4-10.8倍；代理在单次运行中性能为60%，但在8次运行中一致性下降至25%；专家评估表明，CLEAR与生产成功的相关性（ρ=0.83）显著高于仅用准确率评估的方法（ρ=0.41）。

Conclusion: CLEAR提供了一个更全面、更贴近企业实际需求的AI代理评估体系，能够更好平衡性能与运营成本，提升生产部署的可预测性和稳定性。

Abstract: Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HFL-FlowLLM的新框架，首次将大语言模型应用于异构联邦学习中的网络流量分类，显著提升了分类性能并降低了训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在5G和物联网驱动的现代通信网络中，传统的集中式机器学习方法难以应对分布式数据和隐私问题，而现有的联邦学习方法存在高成本和泛化能力差的问题。因此，需要一种更高效、安全且可扩展的网络流量分类方案。

Method: 提出HFL-FlowLLM框架，结合大语言模型与异构联邦学习，利用大语言模型强大的特征提取能力，在保护数据隐私的同时实现对网络流量流的高效分类。

Result: 相比最先进的异构联邦学习方法，平均F1分数提升约13%；随着每轮参与训练的客户端数量增加，相较于现有大语言模型联邦学习框架，平均F1分数最高提升5%，同时训练成本降低约87%。

Conclusion: HFL-FlowLLM在现代通信网络安全中展现出强大的性能、鲁棒性和实用价值，验证了大语言模型在异构联邦学习环境下进行网络流量分类的潜力。

Abstract: In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.

### [303] [Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Understand Chronology?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14214)
*Pattaraphon Kenny Wongchamcharoen,Paul Glasserman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大语言模型（LLM）在时间顺序理解任务中的表现，发现尽管LLM能较好保持局部时序，但在构建全局一致的时间线方面存在困难；通过增加推理预算（如GPT-5在中高推理努力下），可显著提升其在时序排序和条件排序任务上的表现，甚至达到完美水平，表明显式推理资源分配对时序任务至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融和经济领域，LLM常用于基于提示的分析，隐含假设模型具备时间理解能力。然而，这一基础能力尚未被系统评估。本文旨在检验LLM是否真正理解事件的时序关系，尤其是在复杂任务下的表现。

Method: 设计三类递增复杂度的时序任务：（1）纯时序排序；（2）条件排序（先过滤再排序）；（3）时代错乱检测。在GPT-4.1、Claude-3.7 Sonnet（含/不含扩展思维）和GPT-5上进行多推理强度测试，并评估准确率与排序一致性。

Result: 随着序列增长，精确匹配率显著下降，但秩相关性保持较高，说明模型擅长局部排序但难以维持全局一致时序；条件排序失败主要源于过滤阶段而非排序阶段；时代错乱检测相对最容易，但性能仍随时间线重叠增加而下降；GPT-5在中高强度推理下实现全长度完美排序和完美条件排序。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在处理时序信息时存在局限，尤其在长序列和复杂逻辑下依赖显式推理资源才能保证准确性；合理分配推理预算可显著改善表现，这对金融等需实时、准确时序推理的应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段架构，通过自适应层注意力（ALA）和多目标知识蒸馏（KD）来减少Whisper模型在嘈杂环境下的幻觉错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper模型在嘈杂条件下常出现幻觉错误，现有方法多集中于音频预处理或后处理，缺乏对模型本身的改进。

Method: 第一阶段使用自适应层注意力（ALA）增强编码器鲁棒性，第二阶段采用多目标知识蒸馏（KD）框架抑制幻觉。

Result: 在噪声语音基准测试中显著降低了幻觉和词错误率，同时保持了在干净语音上的性能。

Conclusion: ALA与KD结合为提升Whisper模型在真实噪声环境中的可靠性提供了有效策略。

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Motivation: 现有推荐模型在处理复杂的操作逻辑、多样化的用户偏好以及对次优建议敏感等方面存在不足，难以有效应用于物联网设备操作推荐。因此，需要一种更智能、个性化且鲁棒的推荐方法来提升用户体验和企业收益。

Method: 提出DevPiolt模型：首先通过持续预训练和多任务微调赋予LLM物联网领域知识；然后采用直接偏好优化（DPO）对齐用户个性化偏好；最后设计基于置信度的曝光控制机制，避免低质量推荐带来的负面体验。

Result: 离线实验显示DevPiolt在所有数据集上平均性能提升69.5%；已在小米家居App部署三个月，服务25.5万用户；在线实验结果显示设备覆盖用户数提升21.6%，页面接受率提升29.1%。

Conclusion: DevPiolt通过融合LLM与用户偏好优化及置信度控制机制，显著提升了物联网设备操作推荐的效果与实用性，具备良好的实际应用价值和推广前景。

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架不仅提升了区域级短租市场趋势预测的准确性，还可用于识别供应过剩区域，支持数据驱动的城市政策决策。

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型在约束编程问题建模中的表现，发现其成功可能源于训练数据污染而非真正推理能力；通过改写CSPLib问题，实验显示模型在语义和上下文变化下性能显著下降，表明其理解较浅且对措辞敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在检验大型语言模型是否真正具备推理能力来生成约束编程模型，还是因其训练数据中包含常见问题而导致表面成功。

Method: 通过对经典的CSPLib问题进行系统性重述和扰动，在保持结构的同时改变上下文并引入误导元素，比较三种代表性大模型在原始与修改描述下的建模输出。

Result: 实验发现，尽管大模型能生成语法正确且语义合理的模型，但在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降，表现出对问题表述方式的高度敏感性和浅层理解。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在约束编程自动建模中的表现可能被高估，其成功很大程度上依赖于训练数据中的暴露，而非深层语义理解，提示需要更严谨的评估方法以避免数据污染带来的偏差。

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在大语言模型对齐过程中纳入多元价值观的影响，发现不同社会群体的偏好显著影响模型行为，且技术设计选择（如评分尺度、分歧处理方法和优化技术）对对齐效果有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的语言模型对齐过程往往忽视人类社会多样性，可能导致模型无法公平反映不同群体的价值观。因此，研究如何将多元社会价值观融入对齐流程，以实现更安全和更具代表性的模型行为。

Method: 收集来自美国和德国共1,095名参与者（27,375条评分）的数据，从毒性、情感意识、敏感性、刻板偏见和帮助性五个维度评估LLM响应；使用不同社会群体的偏好数据微调多个大语言模型和推理模型，并系统地变化评分尺度、分歧处理方式和优化算法（如DPO与GRPO）。

Result: 发现显著的人口统计学差异：男性比女性评价毒性低18%；保守派和黑人参与者比自由派和白人参与者分别高27.9%和44%的情感意识评分。基于特定群体偏好的微调导致模型行为分化；保留评分者分歧的方法比多数投票减少约53%的毒性，5点量表比二元格式多减少约22%的毒性；DPO在多价值优化中持续优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 模型对齐需平衡专家驱动与用户驱动信号，考虑社会多样性和技术设计选择，以实现更安全、公正和包容的AI系统。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

TL;DR: 提出一种神经符号框架，将感知不确定性传递到规划阶段，在机器人操作任务中实现了高成功率，并提供了理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合连续感知信号与离散符号推理之间的鸿沟，使AI系统能在不确定性下有效进行决策和规划。

Method: 结合基于Transformer的感知前端与图神经网络（GNN）进行关系推理，提取带概率的符号状态，并设计不确定性感知的符号规划器，在置信度低时主动获取信息。

Result: 在10,047个模拟场景中实现F1=0.68的符号提取性能；在三项任务上平均成功率90.7%，超过POMDP基线10-14个百分点，规划时间小于15ms；验证了不确定性校准与规划收敛之间的理论联系。

Conclusion: 该框架成功连接了感知与符号规划，具备良好的通用性、实时性和理论保障，适用于需从感知输入进行不确定性感知推理的各类任务。

Abstract: Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化和AI辅助教育中的信息论驱动知识图谱优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

*Jingyi Jia,Qinbin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了AutoTool，一种基于图的框架，通过利用工具使用惯性模式减少大语言模型代理中的推理成本，在保持任务完成率的同时显著降低了30%的推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在工具选择时依赖重复的LLM推理（如ReAct），导致高昂的推理成本，限制了其可扩展性和效率。

Method: 提出AutoTool框架，构建从历史轨迹中学习到的有向图，节点表示工具，边表示转换概率，并结合参数级信息优化输入生成，从而避免重复调用LLM进行工具选择。

Result: 实验表明，AutoTool在多种任务上最多减少了30%的推理成本，同时保持了与现有方法相当的任务完成率。

Conclusion: 通过引入统计结构（如工具使用惯性）建模，AutoTool为LLM代理提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，证明了结构化先验知识在降低推理成本方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.

*Ruomeng Ding,Wei Cheng,Minglai Shao,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于技能的上下文学习框架SkillGen，用于结构化序列推理，通过构建动作中心图、识别高价值动作并生成细粒度提示，在多个基准任务上显著提升了大语言模型的决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文学习方法在提示质量上存在不足，难以同时满足关注决策关键信息、步骤级细粒度和标签效率三个原则。

Method: SkillGen构建动作中心的领域图，利用时序差分信用分配识别高价值动作，并检索步骤级技能生成上下文感知的细粒度提示。

Result: 在ALFWorld、BabyAI和ScienceWorld任务上，使用开源和专有大模型的实验表明，SkillGen平均提升进展率5.9%-16.5%。

Conclusion: SkillGen通过聚焦高价值动作片段，支持任务可识别性，实现了更有效的上下文学习提示设计，显著提升序列决策性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to sequential decision-making through in-context learning (ICL), yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.

*Parya Dolatyabi,Mahdi Khodayar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于异构智能体强化学习（HARL）的配电网灾后恢复方法，采用HAPPO算法协调多个微电网进行协同恢复，结合物理仿真环境实现约束感知的可扩展优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化和强化学习方法在处理大规模停电后的配电网恢复问题时，因非线性约束和系统异质性而难以高效扩展，亟需一种能够协调分布式能源、适应结构差异且满足物理约束的可扩展方法。

Method: 采用异构智能体强化学习框架HARL，基于HAPPO算法，每个智能体控制一个具有不同负荷、DER容量和开关数量的微电网；使用集中式评论家与去中心化执行者架构，结合OpenDSS物理仿真环境提供潮流反馈，并通过可微惩罚项而非动作掩码来强制执行运行约束。

Result: 在IEEE 123节点和8500节点系统上的实验表明，HAPPO相比DQN、PPO、MAES、MAGDPG等多智能体方法具有更快的收敛速度、更高的复电功率和更稳定的训练表现。

Conclusion: 将微电网层级的异质性纳入HARL框架，能够实现对复杂配电网恢复问题的可扩展、稳定且满足物理约束的求解，为实际电力系统恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.

*Jiarui Li,Alessandro Zanardi,Runyu Zhang,Gioele Zardini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统级框架，将多智能体路径规划（MAPF）的规划与执行统一建模，并引入FICO算法实现高效闭环控制，显著提升计算效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAPF方法通常将规划与执行分离，且难以应对不确定性，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 提出MAPF系统模型，将问题建模为控制系统设计问题，并设计基于滚动时域控制思想的FICO算法，利用结构分解实现高效的闭环求解。

Result: FICO可在毫秒级启动执行，支持数千智能体规模，在随机延迟和动态到达场景下比开环基线减少两个数量级的计算时间并显著提高吞吐量。

Conclusion: 通过系统建模、分解方法和闭环设计，为MAPF提供了统一、高效的解决方案，奠定了分析与改进MAPF的原则性基础。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding is a fundamental problem in robotics and AI, yet most existing formulations treat planning and execution separately and address variants of the problem in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents a system-level framework for MAPF that integrates planning and execution, generalizes across variants, and explicitly models uncertainties. At its core is the MAPF system, a formal model that casts MAPF as a control design problem encompassing classical and uncertainty-aware formulations. To solve it, we introduce Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO), a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for efficient closed-loop operation. FICO enables real-time responses -- commencing execution within milliseconds -- while scaling to thousands of agents and adapting seamlessly to execution-time uncertainties. Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals. These results establish a principled foundation for analyzing and advancing MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的激光雷达-惯性里程计LIO-MARS，通过结合多分辨率surfel地图与高斯混合模型，并利用连续时间B样条轨迹进行联合对齐，实现了高效、鲁棒的实时状态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升自主飞行机器人在搜索与救援等复杂环境中导航的精度与鲁棒性，需要融合互补传感器（如LiDAR和IMU）的数据以实现可靠的实时感知。

Method: 基于MARS的LiDAR里程计，提出了一种新的LiDAR-惯性里程计（LIO），采用非均匀时间节点放置的扫描窗口，在不增加延迟的情况下保证轨迹连续性；使用Kronecker积加速协方差和GMM计算，并通过无迹变换去偏surfel，分段处理实现运动补偿；引入相对位姿软约束和预积分IMU伪测量提升优化精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的LIO-MARS方法通过高效的建图与优化策略，显著提升了激光-惯性融合里程计的性能，适用于复杂环境下的实时自主导航应用。

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems heavily rely on environment knowledge to safely navigate. For search & rescue, a flying robot requires robust real-time perception, enabled by complementary sensors. IMU data constrains acceleration and rotation, whereas LiDAR measures accurate distances around the robot. Building upon the LiDAR odometry MARS, our LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) jointly aligns multi-resolution surfel maps with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using a continuous-time B-spline trajectory. Our new scan window uses non-uniform temporal knot placement to ensure continuity over the whole trajectory without additional scan delay. Moreover, we accelerate essential covariance and GMM computations with Kronecker sums and products by a factor of 3.3. An unscented transform de-skews surfels, while a splitting into intra-scan segments facilitates motion compensation during spline optimization. Complementary soft constraints on relative poses and preintegrated IMU pseudo-measurements further improve robustness and accuracy. Extensive evaluation showcases the state-of-the-art quality of our LIO-MARS w.r.t. recent LIO systems on various handheld, ground and aerial vehicle-based datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出STAR框架，统一时空检索与具身动作，在动态开放世界中高效定位物体，通过STARBench基准验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理动态开放世界中的物体检索时存在局限：场景图忽略时间 grounding，时序推理不支持具身交互，动态场景图仍为闭集且词汇固定。需要统一空间与时间的检索机制。

Method: STAR框架结合非参数化长期记忆与工作记忆，利用视觉-语言模型在每一步选择时空动作，将记忆查询与具身行为统一于单个决策循环。

Result: 在STARBench（含模拟与真实环境）和Tiago机器人上的实验表明，STAR持续优于基于场景图和仅记忆的基线方法。

Conclusion: 将时间与空间搜索视为统一问题可提升服务机器人在动态开放环境中物体检索的性能，STAR为此提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Service robots must retrieve objects in dynamic, open-world settings where requests may reference attributes ("the red mug"), spatial context ("the mug on the table"), or past states ("the mug that was here yesterday"). Existing approaches capture only parts of this problem: scene graphs capture spatial relations but ignore temporal grounding, temporal reasoning methods model dynamics but do not support embodied interaction, and dynamic scene graphs handle both but remain closed-world with fixed vocabularies. We present STAR (SpatioTemporal Active Retrieval), a framework that unifies memory queries and embodied actions within a single decision loop. STAR leverages non-parametric long-term memory and a working memory to support efficient recall, and uses a vision-language model to select either temporal or spatial actions at each step. We introduce STARBench, a benchmark of spatiotemporal object search tasks across simulated and real environments. Experiments in STARBench and on a Tiago robot show that STAR consistently outperforms scene-graph and memory-only baselines, demonstrating the benefits of treating search in time and search in space as a unified problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急救援等关键应用中，多机器人系统需要在拥挤且动态变化的环境中快速、安全地完成任务，传统方法难以兼顾效率与安全。

Method: FACA通过自然语言通信实现机器人间的协作，结合改进的人工势场算法，在冲突时自动形成“环岛”效应，平衡安全与敏捷性。

Result: 实验表明，FACA比基线方法任务完成速度快3.5倍以上，时间减少超过70%，同时保持了可靠的安全距离。

Conclusion: FACA在保证安全性的同时显著提升了多机器人系统在复杂动态环境中的导航效率，验证了自然语言通信在协调控制中的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are increasingly being used for critical applications such as rescuing injured people, delivering food and medicines, and monitoring key areas. These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航方法依赖静态BIM先验或有限的机载感知能力，难以应对动态施工环境中的不确定性。

Method: 融合实时LiDAR数据与BIM先验，构建动态更新的2D占据栅格地图，并引入综合占用不确定性、BIM-地图差异和 Clearance 的统一走廊风险度量；当风险超过阈值时，UAV自动重新扫描以降低不确定性。

Result: 在PX4-Gazebo仿真中验证，相比静态BIM导航，风险触发的重扫描使平均走廊风险降低58%，地图熵减少43%，并保持0.4米以上的安全距离；相比前沿探索法，在一半任务时间内达到相当的不确定性降低效果。

Conclusion: 结合BIM先验与风险自适应空中感知可实现可扩展、抗不确定性的建筑机器人自主导航。

Abstract: This paper presents a BIM-discrepancy-driven active sensing framework for cooperative navigation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in dynamic construction environments. Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics.

Abstract: Conventional suction cups lack sensing capabilities for contact-aware manipulation in unstructured environments. This paper presents FlexiCup, a fully wireless multimodal suction cup that integrates dual-zone vision-tactile sensing. The central zone dynamically switches between vision and tactile modalities via illumination control for contact detection, while the peripheral zone provides continuous spatial awareness for approach planning. FlexiCup supports both vacuum and Bernoulli suction modes through modular mechanical configurations, achieving complete wireless autonomy with onboard computation and power. We validate hardware versatility through dual control paradigms. Modular perception-driven grasping across structured surfaces with varying obstacle densities demonstrates comparable performance between vacuum (90.0% mean success) and Bernoulli (86.7% mean success) modes. Diffusion-based end-to-end learning achieves 73.3% success on inclined transport and 66.7% on orange extraction tasks. Ablation studies confirm that multi-head attention coordinating dual-zone observations provides 13% improvements for contact-aware manipulation.

Conclusion: AsyncVLA通过引入时间灵活性和自纠错机制，显著提升了VLA模型在长时任务中的稳定性和泛化能力，为通用机器人提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building generalist robots. However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA.

Abstract: Household tidying is an important application area, yet current benchmarks neither model user preferences nor support mobility, and they generalize poorly, making it hard to comprehensively assess integrated language-to-action capabilities. To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an "Action (Object, Container)" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in real-world robotic manipulation. However, pre-trained VLA policies still suffer from substantial performance degradation during downstream deployment. Although fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, its reliance on costly demonstration collection and intensive computation makes it impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce VLA-Pilot, a plug-and-play inference-time policy steering method for zero-shot deployment of pre-trained VLA without any additional fine-tuning or data collection. We evaluate VLA-Pilot on six real-world downstream manipulation tasks across two distinct robotic embodiments, encompassing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-Pilot substantially boosts the success rates of off-the-shelf pre-trained VLA policies, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to diverse tasks and embodiments.

Abstract: Understanding the physical interaction with wearable robots is essential to ensure safety and comfort. However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot.

Abstract: Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Active SLAM) involves the strategic planning and precise control of a robotic system's movement in order to construct a highly accurate and comprehensive representation of its surrounding environment, which has garnered significant attention within the research community. While the current methods demonstrate efficacy in small and controlled settings, they face challenges when applied to large-scale and diverse environments, marked by extended periods of exploration and suboptimal paths of discovery. In this paper, we propose MA-SLAM, a Map-Aware Active SLAM system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), designed to address the challenge of efficient exploration in large-scale environments. In pursuit of this objective, we put forward a novel structured map representation. By discretizing the spatial data and integrating the boundary points and the historical trajectory, the structured map succinctly and effectively encapsulates the visited regions, thereby serving as input for the deep reinforcement learning based decision module. Instead of sequentially predicting the next action step within the decision module, we have implemented an advanced global planner to optimize the exploration path by leveraging long-range target points. We conducted experiments in three simulation environments and deployed in a real unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), the results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces both the duration and distance of exploration compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms estimate drone poses and build a 3D map using a single camera. Current algorithms include sparse methods that lack detailed geometry, while learning-driven approaches produce dense maps but are computationally intensive. Monocular SLAM also faces scale ambiguities, which affect its accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware lightweight monocular SLAM system combining sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction. Our method employs deep learning-based depth prediction and edge detection, followed by optimization to refine keypoints and edges for geometric consistency, without relying on global loop closure or heavy neural computations. We fuse inertial data with vision by using an extended Kalman filter to resolve scale ambiguity and improve accuracy. The system operates in real time on low-power platforms, as demonstrated on a DJI Tello drone with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. In addition, we demonstrate robust autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor corridors and on the TUM RGBD dataset. Our approach offers an effective, practical solution to real-time mapping and navigation in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Place recognition, the ability to identify previously visited locations, is critical for both biological navigation and autonomous systems. This review synthesizes findings from robotic systems, animal studies, and human research to explore how different systems encode and recall place. We examine the computational and representational strategies employed across artificial systems, animals, and humans, highlighting convergent solutions such as topological mapping, cue integration, and memory management. Animal systems reveal evolved mechanisms for multimodal navigation and environmental adaptation, while human studies provide unique insights into semantic place concepts, cultural influences, and introspective capabilities. Artificial systems showcase scalable architectures and data-driven models. We propose a unifying set of concepts by which to consider and develop place recognition mechanisms and identify key challenges such as generalization, robustness, and environmental variability. This review aims to foster innovations in artificial localization by connecting future developments in artificial place recognition systems to insights from both animal navigation research and human spatial cognition studies.

Abstract: Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.

Abstract: Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.

Abstract: Industrial robotic systems (IRS) are increasingly deployed in diverse environments, where failures can result in severe accidents and costly downtime. Ensuring the reliability of the software controlling these systems is therefore critical. Mutation testing, a technique widely used in software engineering, evaluates the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small faults, or mutants, into the code. However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection. An empirical study on a pick-and-place scenario demonstrates that our approach produces more informative mutants and reduces the number of invalid or equivalent cases compared to conventional operators. Results highlight the potential of mutation testing to enhance test suite quality and contribute to safer, more reliable industrial robotic systems.

We demonstrate with a simple proof-of-concept implementation for an object-centric force-based policy trained through reinforcement learning for a movement task of a stationary robot arm that is able to avoid colliding with obstacles on a table top after combining the policy with the safety constraints.  The proposed method can be generalized to more complex specifications and dynamic task settings.

Abstract: Flexible robots hold great promise for enhancing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by providing superior dexterity, precise control, and safe tissue interaction. Yet, translating these advantages into endoscopic interventions within open cavities remains challenging. The lack of anatomical constraints and the inherent flexibility of such devices complicate their control, while the limited field of view of endoscopes restricts situational awareness. We present a robotic platform designed to overcome these challenges and demonstrate its potential in fetoscopic laser coagulation, a complex MIS procedure typically performed only by highly experienced surgeons. Our system combines a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation capabilities for performing targeted laser ablations. To enhance surgical awareness, the platform reconstructs real-time mosaics of the endoscopic scene, providing an extended and continuous visual context. The ability of this system to address the key limitations of MIS in open spaces is validated in vivo in an ovine model.

Abstract: Fires in industrial facilities pose special challenges to firefighters, e.g., due to the sheer size and scale of the buildings. The resulting visual obstructions impair firefighting accuracy, further compounded by inaccurate assessments of the fire's location. Such imprecision simultaneously increases the overall damage and prolongs the fire-brigades operation unnecessarily.
  We propose an automated assistance system for firefighting using a motorized fire monitor on a turntable ladder with aerial support from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach. After the selection, the UAV automatically plans and traverses between two triangulation poses for continued fire localization. Simultaneously, our system steers the fire monitor to ensure the water jet reaches the detected heat source. In preliminary tests, our assistance system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed a water jet towards the fires.

Abstract: Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion requires accurate and globally consistent perception of the surrounding 3D environment. However, existing perception modules, mainly based on depth images or elevation maps, offer only partial and locally flattened views of the environment, failing to capture the full 3D structure. This paper presents Gallant, a voxel-grid-based framework for humanoid locomotion and local navigation in 3D constrained terrains. It leverages voxelized LiDAR data as a lightweight and structured perceptual representation, and employs a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this representation to the control policy, enabling fully end-to-end optimization. A high-fidelity LiDAR simulation that dynamically generates realistic observations is developed to support scalable, LiDAR-based training and ensure sim-to-real consistency. Experimental results show that Gallant's broader perceptual coverage facilitates the use of a single policy that goes beyond the limitations of previous methods confined to ground-level obstacles, extending to lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages. Gallant also firstly achieves near 100% success rates in challenging scenarios such as stair climbing and stepping onto elevated platforms through improved end-to-end optimization.

Abstract: Vision--language--action (VLA) models have recently shown promising performance on a variety of embodied tasks, yet they still fall short in reliability and generalization, especially when deployed across different embodiments or real-world environments. In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 感知型控制器在实际应用中日益普及，但由于其非线性、学习型或黑箱特性，难以在存在感知不确定性时进行形式化安全与性能验证。

Conclusion: RoVer-CoRe是首个适用于感知型系统的HJ可达性验证框架，支持复杂非线性系统的安全验证与鲁棒控制设计。

Abstract: As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote.

Abstract: Learning from real-world robot demonstrations holds promise for interacting with complex real-world environments. However, the complexity and variability of interaction dynamics often cause purely positional controllers to struggle with contacts or varying payloads. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Meta-Control (HMC) framework for Loco-Manipulation that adaptively stitches multiple control modalities: position, impedance, and hybrid force-position. We first introduce an interface, HMC-Controller, for blending actions from different control profiles continuously in the torque space. HMC-Controller facilitates both teleoperation and policy deployment. Then, to learn a robust force-aware policy, we propose HMC-Policy to unify different controllers into a heterogeneous architecture. We adopt a mixture-of-experts style routing to learn from large-scale position-only data and fine-grained force-aware demonstrations. Experiments on a real humanoid robot show over 50% relative improvement vs. baselines on challenging tasks such as compliant table wiping and drawer opening, demonstrating the efficacy of HMC.
